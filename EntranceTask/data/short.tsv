''We will custom-color and design tiles in solid colors or floral or geometric patterns,'' said Ms. Stiles, right, about the Manhattan store that bears her name.\nJUDITH STILES' new shop offers 50 different tile designs by the owner, a former adjunct professor of ceramics at Pratt Institute, designs of 20 other American ceramicists - and a host of services. ''We will custom-color and design tiles in solid colors or floral or geometric patterns,'' said Ms. Stiles, right, about the Manhattan store that bears her name. ''We can make relief tiles, duplicate antique tiles, match a wallpaper pattern, or take a photo of your family or dog, and render the picture realistically on a tile.'' There are tiles featuring hares, black bears, fish and raccoons, as well as a tile with a raised surface in the shape of a purple iris. Ceramicists will copy traditional Delft tiles or others to match any pottery the customer likes.\nIn the peach-colored store, the counter functions as a work area where the customers and Ms. Stiles can rearrange tiles and experiment with different colors and patterns.

These materials absorb sound created within a room to lower the noise level in that room and in adjacent rooms. But they help only slightly to keep out noise from an adjoining room or apartment.\nA WAY to lower noise levels in the home is to install acoustical materials such as ceiling tiles and wall panels. These materials absorb sound created within a room to lower the noise level in that room and in adjacent rooms. But they help only slightly to keep out noise from an adjoining room or apartment.\nIf you live in an apartment and your neighbor is noisy, installing acoustical tile on your side of the wall is useless unless your neighbor puts acoustical material on his or her side. The same is true for noises from the room above. Acoustical tile on the ceiling will not decrease noise transmission, but covering the upstairs floor with carpeting and foam padding should be effective.\nTo lower noise that comes through the wall, you can seal wall openings through which sound waves can travel or you can install sound-insulating materials or make alterations to walls or ceilings to isolate or block the vibrations that cause noise to travel from one room to another.\nSince sound waves normally travel through the air, a logical first step would be to close and seal openings through which air can enter. This would be achieved by caulking holes and openings around pipes or electrical wiring and installing weatherstripping around doors and windows.\nInsulation can sometimes help, but only if enough of it is used and if it can be installed inside wall, ceiling or floor cavities. Sound-deadening board will usually help slightly if installed on the surface of a wall or ceiling, but it serves as more of a sound absorber than as sound insulation.\nThe most effective method is to structurally isolate the noise. Noise generated on one side of a wall causes vibrations on the other side. This occurs even when there is no opening through which airwaves can pass because noise creates vibrations that come through the other side. The best way to prevent this is to build two separate walls or partitions that are not in direct contact with each other (see drawing). This will prevent vibrations on one side from being transmitted to the other side. Filling the hollow spaces with bulky insulation will create an even more effective sound barrier.\nSince putting up a second wall or partition means losing from four to six inches of floor space inside the room, you might prefer to build a single wall with staggered studs. As illustrated in the drawing, this involves using a 2-by-6 instead of a 2-by-4 as the bottom plate, then offsetting every other stud by two inches. The result is a thicker wall with gypsum-board panels on one side nailed to a different set of studs than are the gypsum-board panels on the other side. Sound waves that cause one side to vibrate cannot affect panels on the other side. Weaving thick batts of fiberglass insulation back and forth between the studs will further help.\nBoth techniques are mainly used in new construction or when extensive alterations involve removing or rebuilding interior walls. In existing construction,two other techniques are often used to convert an existing wall into a more-soundproof one.\nThe simplest method involves installing a second layer of gypsum board over the existing surface. Best results are achieved if the first layer is a sound-deadening board and the second is gypsum board. The effect will be even more pronounced if this is done on both sides of the wall. In each case, the extra layer of wallboard will add bulk and mass to that wall, greatly improving the acoustical insulating abilities of any wall.\nA more effective way to soundproof an existing wall is to remove the gypsum board from one or both sides, then re-install it on top of resilient metal channels, as shown in the drawing. The channels are attached to the studs with screws along one edge, with the other edge left free. Drywall panels are then attached to these channels with drywall screws instead of nailing them directly to the studs. This creates a ''floating'' wall surface that will absorb vibrations without transmitting them to studs or panels on the other side.\nInsulating a ceiling against the transmission of noise from the room above is usually more of a problem than insulating walls. One reason is that the most common type of noise - someone walking (or stamping) across the floor - creates impact noise, which travels through joists, beams and other structural members. The only practical insulation against such noise is rebuilding the floor above so there is a layer of sound-deadening board under the finished flooring. Carpeting with a thick pad underneath would also help greatly.\nWhen there is enough headroom, noises from upstairs can also be curbed by installing a suspended ceiling that consists of an aluminum grid hung on wires below the existing ceiling. This grid supports panels of acoustical material that form the finished ceiling. The space above this can be filled with thick batts of fiberglass insulation.\nIn rooms with insufficient headroom for a suspended ceiling, screw long lengths of resilient acoustical channel of the kind described for use on walls. The ceiling is then covered with another layer of gypsum board or sound-deadening board by attaching the panels to these channels with screws. By fastening this second layer of gypsum board to the channels instead of to the joists in the ceiling, you create a ''floating'' ceiling that isolates vibrations and helps eliminate the transmission of noise.\nFor maximum effect, close all openings. Even the smallest hole or crack will allow sound waves to pass. Adding bulk insulation to the inside of a wall helps only if the wall (or ceiling) is built using staggered studs or with resilient channels. Adding insulation to the cavities of conventional stud walls normally will not help much.\nNone of these techniques will help much to keep out noise that originates outside the house (unless you are ready to rebuild the exterior walls). The only ways of dealing with these noises is to install draperies or shutters over the windows, weatherstrip all doors and windows, add storm sash to all windows that face the direction of the noise and plant tall shrubs or bushes as a barrier between you and the source of the noise. Even a tall fence will help, but only if it is fairly solid with few openings.

Will extreme cold cause problems when I try to start the mower in spring? A.Your concern does not apply.\nQ.You recently recommended storing a power lawn mower indoors in winter. However, I prefer not to store anything indoors that contains gasoline. I don't have a garage, but I am storing the mower in an unheated utility shed. Will extreme cold cause problems when I try to start the mower in spring? A.Your concern does not apply. One of the first things recommended when storing a power mower is to drain all gasoline from the tank, carburetor and fuel lines. However, storing the mower inside a cold shed will do it no harm and should not affect the engine in any way. Q.We recently moved into a house with an unheated dirt basement. We found firewood stored there, covered with mold. A strong odor of mold pervades the house. We are removing the wood. What else can we do to get rid of the moldy odor? A.First, cover the dirt floor with heavy sheet plastic or heavy tar paper. Overlap strips at least 6 inches and lap them up onto the walls 8 to 10 inches on all sides. Hold the plastic in place with bricks or cement blocks. Be sure the basement area is well ventilated with louvered openings on opposite sides for cross ventilation. The openings should be large enough to provide at least 1 square foot of unobstructed area for every 1,500 square feet of floor area in the basement (screens and louvers over the vents cut the actual size of the opening by half). Q.My family room has a concrete slab floor that is very cold in the winter. It is about a foot lower than the first floor, so I may add a ''false'' insulated floor on top of the slab. I plan to put down 2-by-4's with 5/8-inch plywood on top, filling the spaces between the 2-by-4's with fiberglass insulation. The insulation will have a foil vapor barrier on one side. Where should the vapor barrier go - on the bottom, against the concrete, or on the top, directly under the plywood? A.Always put the vapor barrier on the warmer side of the insulation - the side facing the heated area in the winter. Your vapor barrier should be on top of the insulation, directly under the plywood. Q.Our concrete basement walls are covered with a white crystalline substance that looks something like a powdery dusting of snow. After we washed a portion of the wall off with bleach and water the substance seemed to ''grow'' back. What can be used to remove this? A.This substance is the result of efflorescence. It is caused by the release of alkaline salts that leach out of the concrete when there is dampness present and when there are excess alkalies in the masonry.\nYou can get rid of the powder by washing with a mild solution of muriatic acid (one part acid to five parts water). This neutralizes the alkalies and washes off the white powder.\nThere is no guarantee that the efflorescence won't come back, unless you can eliminate the dampness. Applying a masonry paint or sealer sometimes helps, but not always.\nQuestions about home repair problems should be addressed to Home Improvement Department, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

London Transport also sells T-shirts, greeting cards, jigsaw puzzles, teapot stands, dishes and a wide range of other items bearing representations of the system map, buses and station names. Both licensing programs have substantial financial benefit for their respective agencies: Paris's Regie Autonome des Transports Parisiens earned $1.5 million in royalty payments in 1985; London Transport earns more than $2 million a year.\nSeveral North American transportation agencies, including those in Boston, Montreal, San Francisco and Toronto are looking into licensing their logos and other symbols. In its recent report on marketing at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A recommended that New York's transportation agency do the same.\nLicensing, we believe, could not only raise a few million dollars for the M.T.A., by making New York's transit systems seem as chic as Paris's with its little yellow ticket, but a licensing campaign might also convince a few more metropolitan-area residents and workers to get out of autos, taxis and express buses, and back onto subways, buses and trains.\nNew York needs its transportation system to support its economy - and the transit system needs its riders. In this period of rebuilding and refurbishing at the M.T.A., we feel licensing would be a good step toward marketing its newly clean and efficient services.

43	Incentives to Put More Air Bags in Cars	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D81F3DF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: To the Editor:\nTo the Editor:\nWe were very pleased by your editorial support last June for regulatory incentives to encourage air-bag production in new cars. In light of this position, we were very disappointed to read your news coverage of our proposal to provide just such incentives (news story, Nov. 22), which may have been misleading.\nOur standards require that 10 percent of all new cars manufactured for sale in the United States have automatic crash protection, such as automatic safety belts or air bags. This percentage will increase until Sept. 1, 1989, when all new cars must be so equipped. This regulatory deadline has not changed since it was established in 1984. Contrary to the suggestions in your article, our recent proposal does not affect that deadline.\nThe rule requires automatic protection for both the driver and the right-front-seat passenger. In order to encourage the production of air bags, the rule allows a car that contains a driver-side air bag to be considered in compliance with the rule. Ford Motor Company asked us to consider extending that incentive, and our recent proposal would do so temporarily, for four years.\nIf a manufacturer does not choose to install air bags (or, what the regulatory jargon refers to as ''nonbelt technology''), the manufacturer must comply with the original rule and provide automatic protection for both the driver and the passenger. In that case, the protection would in all likelihood be provided by means of automatic safety belts, as your editorial noted.\nWe strongly believe that this incentive will encourage the production of greater numbers of air bags for the driver's side than we would have seen under the original rule, and will also encourage the orderly development and production of passenger-side air bags. The proposal has been supported publicly by safety advocates, including the National Safety Council, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, numerous insurance companies and other organizations. Your editorial in support of Ford's proposal urged us to ''meet Ford at least part way,'' to stimulate the engineers and to assist the domestic auto industry in meeting foreign competition.\nI particularly take issue with the news article's characterization of our proposal as ''the latest in a series of moves aimed at relaxing Federal regulation of the automobile industry.'' Our proposal would not delay or relax the automatic crash protection rule. Rather, it proposes an incentive that is available only to those manufacturers who choose to employ a more expensive, highly effective safety technology - the air bag. DIANE K.

44	New York City Environment Cleared in Cleopatra's Needle Case	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D81F3DF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: To the Editor:\nTo the Editor:\nI was pleased with Robert Whiteford's affection for our obelisk (which was a gift to New York City, by the way, not to the nation), but disturbed over the canard about ''the damage done in less than 100 years'' (''Disappearing Needle,'' letter, Dec. 16).\nThis has often been asserted by thoughtless geologists and journalists (a writer in Smithsonian magazine declared that the pair of obelisks left Egypt, one for New York and its mate for London, ''in mint condition''). In 1965, however, a temperate writer stated, ''the disastrous disintegration rate of granite in city atmosphere, as exemplified by Cleopatra's Needle, is a myth,'' adding, ''It is therefore hoped that the obelisk will be eliminated from textbooks of physical geology as a 'good example of weathering in cities.' ''\nHistorically, the New York obelisk, which Napoleon had intended for France when he saw it, was subsequently refused because of poor condition, in favor of the well-preserved Luxor shaft removed to Paris in 1836. The London twin to New York was rejected in 1849 for the same reason. In the 19th century there were observations of native vendors peddling granite chips from the obelisk at the site in Alexandria. In New York, in 1891, it was observed of the Needle's west face that ''the abrasion caused by the sand of the Libyan desert has effaced almost every hieroglyph on this side of the obelisk.''\nConservation began early. The tip was said to have been repaired in Alexandria circa 1880. During re-erection in New York in 1881, some structural repairs were made (note replacements in the limestone foundation steps; the bronze crabs were replacements forged at the Brooklyn Navy Yard). By 1885, 780 pounds of granite scale were removed from the shaft, which was then treated with paraffin. As for the resistance of such granite in New York's climate, there are miles of curbstone regularly polluted by exhausts and urine, and exterior building walls (e.g., the Museum of Natural History), in good condition.\nMeanwhile, the obelisk, in Central Park, on its knoll, amid the trees, behind the sheltering wall of the museum, away from the motor traffic, appears to be ideally sited; when conditions become severe, it will also be time to put Trinity Church, the Public Library and City Hall under glass.\nIncidentally, the literature, considerable and thorough (woodcut illustrations of the hieroglyphs were published in the 1650's), is available in the public library.

Each indicator in this system has been carefully subjected to a sophisticated statistical program of standardization, weighting and averaging with other indicators in the process of constructing the composite indexes.\nThe resulting composite indexes represent summary measures designed to signal changes in the direction of aggregate economic activity, e.g., the gross national product. They are not designed to estimate magnitude of change. Therefore, it is inappropriate to state that the October figures ''most likely pointed to a continuation of lackluster economic growth.''\nThe system of indexes of leading indicators is described in the Department of Commerce's Handbook of Cyclical Indicators (1984), which states clearly (page 65) that ''Each index measures the average behavior of a group of economic time series that show similar timing at business cycle turns but represent widely differing activities or sectors of the economy.''\nThe 12 indexes that tend to lead at business cycle turns are combined and classified as leading indicators, the 4 indicators that tend to coincide with the cyclical peak are classified as coincident indicators, and the 6 that tend to lag are classified as lagging indicators. A fourth measure, the ratio of coincident to lagging indicators, is added to confirm the movement in the composite index of leading indicators.\nWhile this system of indicators has performed well in the last 40 years in foreshadowing turning points in the general economy, it requires professional experience to interpret the monthly movements in the underlying data and a sophisticated analysis to apply such data to the near-term outlook for various industries or sectors in the economy.\nMonthly movements in the composites of the leading indicators, the coincident indicators, the lagging indicators and the ratio of coincident to lagging indicators should be interpreted together with other factors in the system, such as monetary policy, fiscal policy and the international economy before the analyst can venture an opinion on the rate of the economy's growth in the months ahead.\nOne month's worth of statistics for a volatile, complex series such as the composite index of leading indicators does not suffice to establish a new trend in either direction. It takes at least six months of data to identify a trend with a high degree of confidence. Accepting one month of such statistical data always leads to misleading information and erroneous conclusions about the future course of the economy. ALAN E.

Before 1600 no more than a trickle of writing by women saw print. By the beginning of the 18th century, however, numbers of women not only published their work but also made a living from it.\nTHE 17th century was an important period of transition for both women writers and women readers. Before 1600 no more than a trickle of writing by women saw print. By the beginning of the 18th century, however, numbers of women not only published their work but also made a living from it.\nAt the same time women readers were starting to make their presence felt. Just a few years later they would be legion, an audience large enough to support the burgeoning novel and the soon-to-be-established institution of the lending library.\nOne of the earliest publishers to recognize the new audience of women was the London bookseller John Dunton. He did not, it must be admitted, come upon the idea all on his own; it more or less came upon him. In 1691 Dunton founded The Athenian Mercury, a biweekly magazine whose purpose was to resolve ''all nice and curious questions.'' Readers were invited to send their queries ''by penny post to Smith's Coffee-House in Stocks Market in the Poultry.''\nTo Dunton's surprise, one of the first letters was from a ''gentle-woman'' who wished to know whether women as well as men might send questions. Dunton replied affirmatively and on May 23, 1691, the magazine printed her queries. She wanted to know, first of all, whether ''beauty be real or imaginary.'' Both, the Mercury answered: although social custom as well as the individual eye determines what the standard of beauty is to be, some things are ''shaped more neat, cleverly and handsome than others, as we may grossly see in a horse compared with an elephant, a greyhound with a swine or cur.''\nThe woman's most pressing question, however, was less generally philosophic: Was it ''proper for women to be learned?'' Some people believe, the editor replied, that a woman is learned enough if she can ''distinguish between her husband's breeches and another man's,'' but ''we see no reason why women should not be learned now,'' as they were in former times.\nHaving admitted the fair sex to its forum, the Mercury found their questions so ''pressing and numerous'' that it decided to oblige them by setting aside the first Tuesday in every month especially for them. Thus, the first ''women's page'' was born.\nSome women sent in questions having to do with love and marriage, but others ranged over all the field of knowledge as it was then constituted, from philosophy and religion to jurisprudence, literature, the natural world and the supernatural. The curious wanted to be informed about such matters as the science of motion; the cause of the winds rising and falling; whether fishes smell, taste and hear. A literary lady asked whether the Athenians thought Sappho or Aphra Behn were the better poetess.\nThe first women's page was such a success that after two years John Dunton ventured yet another innovation: a magazine designed entirely for female readers. Ladies Mercury began publication on ''Munday'' Feb. 28, 1693. The layout of the new magazine was the same as that of The Athenian Mercury, but the subject matter was very different. In the first issue a letter explained that the Ladies Mercury ''yielded up'' to The Athenian Mercury the ''examination of learning, nature, arts, sciences and indeed the whole world, being contented to bound our narrow speculation to only that little sublunary woman.''\nThe second issue of the Ladies Mercury reminded readers that the magazine only dealt with questions of love, marriage and domestic concerns, and stipulated that it not be ''troubled with other questions relating to learning, religion, etc.''\nThus circumscribed, Ladies Mercury began to repeat itself. Whereas The Athenian Mercury had leaped happily from subject to subject, its offshoot retailed the same advice to the same questions more and more dispiritedly. After only five issues, publication ceased.\nIt is not hard to guess why the Ladies Mercury failed. Clearly, its original female audience was interested in the same subject matter as the male readers. A significant body of women readers were eager to be informed about the arts and sciences, history, the world, but Dunton's publication had arbitrarily limited the subject matter to what might be seen as the purely personal.\nIn the 1970's feminists protested the assumption that ''traditional'' feminine concerns were trivial. They soon established the value of personal experience as an important subject to explore and eventually transformed the landscape of writing by and about women. The new writing was for a time refreshing and, more than that, gave voice to a whole new range of experience. It was with a new sense of freedom that women wrote about their emotions, marriages, divorces and child-bearing.\nBut it seems to me that this mode has become repetitious. Without reference to the arts and sciences, to language, imagination, ideas, the purely personal is stripped of its power. Without connection to the ''world,'' it risks becoming sterile.\nWhen we focus too exclusively on the digestion of our own personal experiences, we not only revisit the limitations of the traditonal ''woman's sphere'' but also sadly circumscribe our horizons of interest and possible worlds.

That is $128.70, or 4.3 percent, more than 1986's top tax. Employers pay the same amount.\nThe average monthly benefit for retired workers will rise by $6, to $488. For an elderly couple, the average payment will go up by $11, to $833.\nBut most of the elderly will find their ''take home'' pay from Social Security going up less than $6 because they will be charged $2.40 more each month for Medicare coverage.\nThe benefit increase matches the change in the Consumer Price Index from the third quarter of 1985 through the third quarter of 1986. It is the smallest rise since Social Security was linked to the price index in 1975.

Politically sensitive subsidies on basic food items were broadly unchanged. In a speech Monday, King Fahd had warned that the budget would involve cuts, but he reassured the Saudi people that key subsidies would not be touched.\nSaudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was hit hard this year by the fall in crude prices and twice postponed its budget, originally due to be announced last March. It has now redefined its fiscal year to coincide with the Western calendar, although Wednesday's budget was officially designated 1407-08 under the Islamic system.\nA Finance Ministry statement, distributed to newspapers in the kingdom by the Saudi Press Agency, said 1987 spending would total 170 billion riyals, or about $45.3 billion, and revenue 117.3 billion riyals, about $31.3 billion.

In 1985, the economy shrank nearly 2 percent, after growing 8.2 percent a year earlier.\nThe Prime Minister said manufacturing was beginning to pick up, but commerce, banking and building activity were still depressed. Despite holding down wage increases, Singapore had still not recovered its competitiveness against countries such as Taiwan and South Korea.\n''We need at least one more year of high-productivity growth and wage restraint to close the gap,'' he said.

55	RADON: FOR THE HOMEOWNER, SOME QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DC123CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: IN the last year or so, the radioactive gas radon has emerged as perhaps the nation's leading environmental threat to health. The risk it poses is lung cancer, and experts at the Environmental Protection Agency estimate that radon may cause 5,000 to 20,000 of the nation's deaths from lung cancer each year.\nIN the last year or so, the radioactive gas radon has emerged as perhaps the nation's leading environmental threat to health. The risk it poses is lung cancer, and experts at the Environmental Protection Agency estimate that radon may cause 5,000 to 20,000 of the nation's deaths from lung cancer each year. The American Cancer Society predicted that in 1986 about 130,000 people would die of lung cancer.\nRadon's existence outdoors is ubiquitous. It comes from the natural decay chain of uranium 238, which is radioactive and a common element in rock and soil. Outside, radon dissipates quickly and is not regarded as a serious health risk.\nThe hazard, however, arises indoors. In the last two years, scientists became aware that levels in homes can be far higher than ever imagined. The Federal Enviromental Protection Agency said in August that perhaps 8 million of the nation's 70 million homes had radon levels above its recommended guideline. Radon experts in the scientific community are more conservative, saying that the number may be closer to five million.\nDespite their differing assessments, Government and private scientists stress the need to educate the public, particularly homeowners, on radon's threats.\nFollowing are some common questions about radon in the home: Q.Why is radon considered dangerous? A.The gas, which is odorless, invisible and tasteless, is not the culprit. But as it decays, it produces polonium 218 and polonium 214. They both emit radioactive alpha particles that can cling to dust. Inhaled, they can lodge in the lung's sensitive airways and experts say it can possibly cause lung cancer after latency periods of 20 to 30 years. Q.By what process does radon enter homes? A.The gas is sucked in from the soil. Most common pathways are cracks in cellar floors, walls or joints; sump drains; openings around water and gas pipes, and the hollow interiors of cinder blocks. Q.How is it drawn inside the home? A.Most commonly, scientists say, by negative air pressure created inside the home. Q.How does that sort of pressure occur? A.Furnaces and exhaust fans are common causes. As they consume indoor air, interior air pressure drops below the pressure in the ground, creating a suction effect that pulls radon gas from soil in through the minute passageways. Anything that draws air adds to the suction effect, including fireplaces, range hoods, water heaters and washers and dryers.\nAlso, pressure differences can be created by wind, the placement of windows and a home's heating system. Causes are not always obvious, which makes testing important in those areas identified as vulnerable.\nIn homes using well water, any radon in the water can enter via faucets, shower nozzles and dish and clothes washers. But the levels are usually far below those from soil gas, unless the well water itself has very high levels. Water that comes from reservoirs and rivers does not pose a problem, experts say. Q.How do I know what the radon level is in my home? A.You cannot know without having a professional perform a test. Q.Who will perform the testing procedure? A.Commercial testing companies, which usually charge $25 to $50 per each small testing device placed in the home. There are two such devices - charcoal canisters and alpha-track detectors.\nThe testing industry is nascent, so beware of con artists and the unscrupulous. State health and radiation-protection offices have been refining their lists of reputable laboratories and will provide names free.\nIn New York State, call 518-473-3613 or 800-342-3722. In New Jersey, 800-648-0394. In Connecticut, 203-566-8167. In Massachussetts, 617-727-6214. The Environmental Protection Agency's regional offices also have lists of companies. For residents of New Jersey and New York call the E.P.A. New York office, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10278; 212-224-2514. Residents of New England should contact the E.P.A. Boston office, Room 2203, J.F.K. Federal Buildling, Boston, Mass. O2203; 617-565- 3234. Residents of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Washington D.C., Virgina and West Virginia, should contact the E.P.A. Philadelphia office at 841 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19107; 215-597-8320 These E.P.A. offices can also provide two free up-to-date booklets on radon, ''A Citizen's Guide to Radon: What It Is and What to Do About It'' and ''Radon Reduction Methods: A Homeowner's Guide.'' Q.What indoor radon levels concern scientists? A.There is disagreement here. E.P.A.'s guideline is 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air. Anything above that should be reduced, the agency says. Private experts think that level is too alarmist. Dr. Naomi Harley, a radiation expert and professor of environmental medicine at the New York University Medical Center, says the guideline should be 8 picocuries per liter. Experts do agree, however, that homes with high levels of radon need immediate attention, while those with levels under 8 or 10 picocuries are not as urgent. Q.What is a measuring unit called a picocurie? A.A picocurie is a measurement of airborne radon gas. It is one-trillionth of a curie and represents the decay of two radon atoms per minute. Q.Is there another type of measurement? A.Yes, another measurement is called ''working levels,'' or WL. A ''working level'' is a measure of radon's alpha-emitting decay products, polonium 218 and polonium 214. The two methods of measurement are interchangeable. It is important to know how to figure both, as some private radon-testing laboratories use only one or the other.\nThere are 200 picocuries per 1 working level. To convert a picocurie measurement to WL, divide the picocurie reading by 200. Thus, 200 picocuries is the same as 1 WL. The E.P.A. standard of 4 picocuries per liter of air is .02 WL. Q.Are indoor levels of the gas constant? A.No. They are highest at cellar or ground-level entry points and decline on upper floors. They can also vary day-to-day and season-to-season. So, a longer testing period, preferably months, gives a better average reading. Levels in neighboring houses can vary widely, depending on differences in construction and soil textures. Q.What levels of radon cause cancer? A.This cannot be predicted with absolute certainty. But obviously the higher the level, the greater the danger. The E.P.A. estimates ranges of fatal lung cancers for various radon levels. These risks presuppose a person being exposed to a particular level for 75 percent of the time for 70 years. Critics argue that this exposure time is unrealistic, but Government specialists say they want to be conservative.\nThe E.P.A. estimates that if 1,000 people are exposed to a level of 4 picocuries for 75 percent of the time for 70 years, 13 to 50 of them will contract fatal lung cancer. In homes with levels of 10 picocuries, of which experts estimate there are 700,000 nationally, the death risk increases to from 30 to 120 for each 1,000 people exposed.\nScientific experts like Dr. Harley argue that those ratios are far too high. Based on studies of uranium miners, Dr. Harley says the 4-picocurie per liter standard's death risk is 9 per thousand people for a lifelong exposure.\nDespite this disagreement, Federal and scientific experts agree that radon is a greater risk than more widely publicized threats like asbestos, toxic waste dumps and dioxin. Q.Will states perform tests in homes? A.By winter's end, the New York\nState Department of Health plans to start a $3 million testing program for thousands of homes. Homeowners able to prove by receipts that they initiated energy conservation measures in the home can get free detectors; others will pay about $20, officials say. Q.Are states looking for hot spots? A.Many have begun investigations. New York State recently projected - based on a sample of 2,400 homes - that 95 percent of the 2.6 million single-family homes across the state have radon levels at or below the Federal guideline of four picocuries per liter. Officials said, however, that the sampling could not rule out the existence of localized radon hot spots. New Jersey plans to test 6,000 buildings statewide in coming months and Connecticut 1,500.\nThe worst known hot spot in the country is Clinton, N.J., a rural town of about 2,000 15 miles east of the Delaware River. There 105 homes atop a uranium-laden limestone cliff had readings above the E.P.A.'s 4 picocurie per liter standard. Of them, 35 were at or above 200 picocuries and 5 were above 1,000. Q.What was done as a result of those readings? A.Since late spring, the E.P.A. has turned 10 homes with the highest levels into a research laboratory, testing and perfecting technology to reduce the radon. They are pleased with the results. Six of the 10 now have levels below the standard, according to Alfred B. Craig, head of the E.P.A. research team. Q.What methods were found successful? A.A reduction system called ''sub-slab ventilation.'' Several pipes were placed through the cellar floors into gravel bases beneath them and then linked to a single pipe running upward in the home to the roof. An exhaust fan atop the roof outlet drew the radon up through the piping and out into the air.\nProfessional installation of this system can cost up to $3,000. It was done free in Clinton as an experiment. Q.What are other reduction methods? A.The Environmental Protection\nAgency's booklet ''Radon Reduction Methods'' outlines nine, their likely cost and their effectiveness. Marginal or low radon readings can usually be reduced by sealing basement walls and floor cracks and covering drain and utility pipe openings, covering exposed soil and using natural or forced ventilation. Professional advice is usually necessary and success of any measures should be verified by retesting.\nFor homes with readings of 10 picocuries or less, Mr. Craig reports considerable success with a ventilation system called the air-to-air heat exchanger that expels contaminated air and replaces it with an equal amount of fresh outside air. Described in the E.P.A. booklet, the cost ranges from $400 to $1,500. Q.If I'm buying a home, should I get an inspection? A.The experts advise yes. Most predict that a radon inspection one day will be as commonplace in housing sales as a termite inspection.\nThe National Association of Realtors says that a sales agent must inform a buyer if the agent believes a home is in a radon-prone area. Failure of a sales agent to tell a buyer facts affecting a home's value, including past radon detection, could violate the association's code of ethics and expose the agent to civil suit, according to Walter Molony, an association spokesman.\nCorrection: January 3, 1987, Saturday, Late City Final Edition

Erin's two families live a few miles apart.\nIn her adoptive family, Erin has four older sisters, including one who was also adopted, an older brother, a dog, a rabbit and three cats.\n''It's very advantageous for her to be in a family with other children, which is exactly what her parents wanted for her,'' said her adoptive mother, Carol McGarvey. ''She became so animated because there is just so much going on.''\nWhen she arrived at the McGarveys' home in this section of Barnstable on Cape Cod, Erin, who has Down's syndrome, was unable to sit up. Today, she has begun to walk and talk and has the development level of an 18-month-old.\nHer biological parents and 8-year-old sister form part of an extended family, according to Mrs. McGarvey. ''They're there for financial support,'' she said. ''They're there for emotional support. They're there if we need it.''\nThey have brought over some of their older daughter's clothes ''as if passing down items from one child to another like she's still in the family,'' Mrs. McGarvey said. They also have brought Erin gifts.\n''Yes, it's working out,'' said Mrs. McGarvey. ''We're still really glad we did it.''\nErin's adoption attracted nationwide attention when it became final March 14, although the surrender papers had been signed in June 1985.\nHer biological mother said she decided to give Erin up after keeping her for 14 months because the child's needs overwhelmed her.\nShe had lost a baby to meningitis nearly three years earlier and her husband, a fisherman, was often away from home, making it difficult to deal with Erin, she said.\nIt was ''probably the most wrenching decision a woman would have to make,'' she said, and ''I just have to to be real positive about the choice and know that I did it out of love for Erin.''\n''I can honestly say I don't regret the decision,'' the 34-year-old biological mother, who asked not to be identified, said in a recent interview. ''Of course, I can honestly say, I wish I never had to go through it.''\nThe family did not put Erin up for adoption at birth because her husband thought it was ''too dramatic a step to take,'' she said. But she said she felt a bit apathetic toward the baby because of her own bitter feelings.\n''I suppose the martyr thing to have done would have been to keep Erin for all the wrong reasons and I could have been as miserable as I wanted behind my closed doors,'' she said.\nMrs. McGarvey said she understood and admired Erin's biological mother. ''I think it is absolutely fantastic,'' she said, ''to be able to put aside all your motherly feeling and say, 'This is what I have to do for what's best for her.' I think it's the most unselfish thing you could do.''\n''I feel I've said my goodbyes,'' said Erin's biological mother. ''There will be a need for me in another six months to see her,'' she said. ''I can feel it building. The special kind of bond I feel for Erin won't die.''

A celebration does seem in order.\n''Musical Kids'' is subtitled ''A Celebration of Philadelphia's Settlement Music School,'' and why not? The school, as seen in the 30-minute film on Channel 13 at 10:30 tonight, is an admirable place - dead serious, and at the same time a home to deep pleasure. A celebration does seem in order.\nThe school, founded in 1908 as part of the settlement-house movement, now teaches some 3,000 students. ''Musical Kids,'' produced and directed by Peggy Daniel, visits classes. No one, apparently, forces the young people to attend. They make music because they want to.\nMeanwhile, we get a sense of an amiable autocracy at work. Students may indeed look rapt and happy, but the teachers are in charge. ''Good students should be able to read music like a novel,'' a teacher says firmly. A student says the teacher is trying to cram four years of theory into less than one year. The system seems to work.\n''Musical Kids'' notes, as evidence, that graduates of the Settlement Music School include 30 present or former members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, composers who have won Pulitzer Prizes and Oscars, Chubby Checker and Clamma Dale. On the other hand, the school doesn't exist only to train professionals; it exists because it's in the great tradition of settlement houses. It fills a social need.\n''Musical Kids'' doesn't come down too heavily here, and it doesn't succumb to sentimentality. But it does show us young people of all kinds making music and enriching and widening their lives. The executive director, Robert Capanna, says the school wants to involve everyone in the community.\nWe can't tell how successful it is at doing this, although the film, presented on public television by WHYY of Philadelphia, indicates that the school does try. ''Musical Kids'' is a beguiling film about an enchanting institution.

They travel the world, picking up local rhythm sections to play with them.\nThe trombonist Al Grey and the saxophonist Buddy Tate, both seasoned veterans of many years with the Count Basie orchestra, are constantly on the road now, either together or singly. They travel the world, picking up local rhythm sections to play with them.\nThis week Mr. Tate and Mr. Grey are home for the holidays at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, between 11th and Perry Streets, through Sunday, with a superb ''local'' rhythm section made up of musicians as widely traveled as they - Sir Roland Hanna on piano, Major Holley on bass and the drummer Bobby Durham, on leave from Ella Fitzgerald.\nDespite the Basie backgrounds of Mr. Tate and Mr. Grey, there is almost as much of Duke Ellington in their style and repertory as there is of Basie. This comes not only from Mr. Grey's Ellingtonian growling with a plunger mute, or Mr. Tate's swaggering sweep, but also from Mr. Hanna, who, in this group, becomes a straight-ahead swinger rather than the more complex and innovative pianist he is apt to be in his solo or trio performances. He plays much of the time with a punchy drive that suggests the open, swinging joy of the Basie band, but when the group takes up the Duke's ''C Jam Blues,'' his solo contribution is a railroad blues with spare, ringing Ellington chords.\nMr. Tate plays clarinet with increasing frequency these days, using a warm, mellow tone that is particularly effective in the bending, shimmering lines of ''Blue Tate,'' on which Mr. Grey gives a masterful demonstration of the soft, cushioned, distant sound that he can achieve with his normally growling or raucous plunger mute.

Market watchers, however, said the market would initially suffer teething problems because of the complex nature and novelty of the investment instruments.\n''The U.S. mortgage-backed securities market is probably the most innovative yet complex securities market in the world,'' said James Stevens, an analyst at Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.\nThe Canadian Government, looking to increase funds available for mortgages and spark a revival in long-term mortgages, will guarantee repayment of the securities for investors.\nMr. Stevens noted that the new securities have the growth potential of mortgage-backed securities sold in the United States by the Government National Mortgage Association and the Federal National Mortgage Association. Initially, he added, the new securities will attract the smaller investor, but once larger issues with longer terms are offered, the big institutions will become involved.\nBecause the securities are exempt from Canadian withholding taxes, there is expected to be considerable foreign interest. Foreign investors, particularly the Japanese, are playing an increasingly large role in the Canadian bond market.
63	NEW LOOK FOR HISTORIC HOUSES: ACCURACY REPLACES IDEALISM	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED9133CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: CURATORS of historic houses are responding to new technologies and methods of research to change the long-cherished Colonial Revival taste, which governed earlier room restorations. From the 1930's through the 1970's, experts say, many rooms in these houses were furnished according to an idealized version of 18th- and early 19th-century elegance.\nCURATORS of historic houses are responding to new technologies and methods of research to change the long-cherished Colonial Revival taste, which governed earlier room restorations. From the 1930's through the 1970's, experts say, many rooms in these houses were furnished according to an idealized version of 18th- and early 19th-century elegance. According to Christine Meadows, curator of Mount Vernon, during those five decades historical accuracy was considered secondary to ''making the room settings pretty, warm and attractive.''\nVisitors to the Governor's Palace at Colonial Williamsburg and to Mount Vernon and Gunston Hall, which are near Washington, are seeing rerestored rooms, simpler and brighter, shorn of their Colonial Revival trappings of fussy curtains, heavy rugs and drably painted walls. These changes have been brought about by the results of three areas of research: advances in chemical-analysis techniques, which have shown a wide range of brighter colors; new methods of interior archeology, using special lights and filters to reveal lost architecural elements, and the increased scholarship and use of period inventories as prime resources.\nJohn Davis, senior curator of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, describes the changes at the Governor's Palace as ''a shift away from the 1930's view of decorative arts as fine arts into the contemporary social-cultural approach.'' By meticulously following the 15,000-item inventory made at the death in 1770 of Baron de Botetourt, sixth Governor of the Virginia Colony, as well as his butler's account books recently uncovered at Badminton House in England, curators have been able to discern the palace's arrangements during his tenure.\nOver the past seven years, the Governor's Palace has been completely rerestored to reflect the findings of the inventory. In the 1930's reconstruction, the dining room was furnished with a single banquet table. The inventory, however, indicated a more multiuse room. Now there are two smaller dining tables, 12 mahogany chairs, smoking chairs, writing desks, library tables and ink stands for the gentlemen who lingered over port and politics after dinner.\nEven the paint color is different. In another document, ''The Executive Journals of the Council'' of 1727, the curators discovered that the dining room had been newly painted in a pearl color. Off came the stone-gray paint of the 1930's in favor of a pearly color with a touch of blue.\nCurtains and floor coverings are usually the areas that are changed. Research shows that certain 18th-century window treatments were less ornate than Colonial Revivalists believed and that sea-grass matting was used instead of Oriental rugs. Often floorboards were simply left bare. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in George Washington's study at Mount Vernon, which has been rerestored in recent years, according to his death inventory of 1799.\nFormerly, the room had dark stained floors and white-painted bookshelves. It was formally furnished with a wing chair, a Queen Anne side chair, an Oriental rug and damask drapes copied from a Chippendale pattern.\nThe floors have been stripped and the paneling and window frames have been painted in a rediscovered faux-bois pattern. The Oriental rug has been removed, as has the Queen Anne chair. What remains is a stand-up desk, Washington's dressing table, a book press, a globe of the world and windows that are bare, without draperies - simple necessities for an early-rising plantation owner.\nGone are the days when Mount Vernon's curators only flirted with the inventory and accepted as gifts furnishings not necessarily correct. In 1979, Matthew J. Mosca, a conservator of architectural finishes, was hired to analyze and ascertain the original paint colors. ''Formerly, we used only the scraping technique and matched the color at the right chronological level,'' said Miss Meadows, the curator of Mount Vernon. ''The color we were big on was putty.'' Over the years, the original colors were altered by air, light and dirt to become putty-colored. Mount Vernon's dining room now sparkles in verdigris, a 1980's change. ''Frequently forgotten,'' Miss Meadows added, ''is that interior illumination was a scarce commodity in 1799 so everything had to reflect and enhance light.''\nAs in other historic houses now being rerestored, Mount Vernon's bright new paints were custom-mixed using 18th-century formulas and applied with traditional round hog-bristle brushes. These brushes pick up the pigments in layers and create more luminescent surfaces.\nGunston Hall, a one-and-a-half-story brick Georgian house on the Potomac River south of Mount Vernon, was the home of George Mason, who drafted the Bill of Rights. Designed in the late 1750's by William Buckland, an English indentured servant, Gunston Hall displays the earliest example of chinoiserie carving in the colonies. Although many clues about the original interiors were previously researched, the 1950 restoration gave the house only a nonspecific English elegance, according to its curator, Susan Borchardt. Architectural detective work began in 1981, using red-glass filters and black light to discover both incorrect moldings and the placement of lost architectural elements.\nThe missing Doric entablature beneath the crown molding in the entrance hall was reconstructed last year. Curators think that the original was probably removed and sold in the 19th century. High-intensity light revealed ghosts - the bare outlines of the long-gone molding's metopes and triglyphs. Larry Jones, a restoration craftsman working at Gunston Hall, has used 38 different chisels to carve the rosette medallions in the replacement moldings. To determine the design for these and the 12 hand-carved pilasters, Mr. Jones consulted, as no doubt Buckland himself did, drawings in Abraham Swan's 1745 ''The British Architect,'' a bible of interior design that was in every colonial gentleman's library.\nIn Washington, curators of the 1800 Octagon House are gradually changing its character after researching period documents. New colors are being introduced and almost 30 layers of old paint are being removed from the rosette and bellflower com position work in the entrance hall.\nDuring a structural restoration in the 1960's, according to its curator, Nancy Davis, the entrance hall was painted buff with gray trim, Now painted verdigris with stone-white crown molding, chair rails and door surrounds, the hall presents the same look it must have had when Dolley Madison and the President took refuge there in 1814, after the White House burned.\nMindful of future days when technological advances may reveal additional information, several curators of historic houses are leaving small areas untouched: a patch of wall in a drawing room, a bedroom baseboard molding or a string of rosettes on a fireplace surround.\nIn the 1804 George Read II House, which is in the Colonial town of New Castle, Del., the curators are rerestoring most of the rooms with Federal furniture examples recorded in the l836 estate inventory. However, they decided to keep the dining room, restored by private owners in the 1920's, in its opulent Colonial Revival state as an example of the once-popular style.\nSince traditional pigments used in rerestorations will change as rapidly as they did in the 18th century, a question facing curators of historic houses is how frequently should walls be repainted for historical accuracy. In the meantime, homeowners who wish to keep up with the Colonial look, marketed by the sole distributors of the Williamsburg paint colors, the Martin Senour Paint Company, will want to know that ''Palace Dining Room Gray'' has been replaced on the paint card by ''Palace Dining Room Pearl-Blue.''

Truman, blown off its pedestal by a bomb in March, had been repaired and would be re-erected next month.\nBut the 12-foot bronze statue will be placed in the courtyard of the Athens War Museum, and not in the downtown square where it had stood, the Interior Ministry said.\nPresident Truman's memory is a vivid symbol here because of the help he sent to anti-Communist forces in the civil war of the late 1940's.\nThe leftist-dominated Athens City Council had voted against the restoration of the statue, which was damaged before an official visit by Secretary of State George P. Shultz. Conservative council members accused the leftists of essentially condoning the bomb attack.\nAfter complaints from the conservative opposition and from Greek-Americans, who had provided the money to put up the statue in the early 1960's, the Socialist Government said it was repairing the damage and was looking for a spot for its relocation.\nIt apparently decided to resolve the issue quickly after Greek-American organizations announced that they were arriving here in March to erect the statue in a formal ceremony.

''The opposite of Darwin's theory.'' Power-Lifting Helped\nGolic at the time asked the strength coach, Dave Redding, ''Shall I take something?''\nRedding said he would not condone steroids, so Golic suggested instead a diet of ''Twinkies and a lot of beer.''\nRedding, however, introduced him to his first intense power-lifting program and his playing weight went from 235 to 255 and on to 270.\nSaid Golic today, as the Browns finished three days of practice here at Dodgertown for their playoff game Saturday against the Jets, ''I'm comfortable at 270, half quickness, half ballast.''\nThe 29-year-old Notre Dame alumnus has many opinions - including some about steroids.\n''I hope they do start getting some kind of steroid testing,'' he said. ''It would make my job a lot easier. There are guys around the league that you know are using something because there is no way they could look like that. They look like somebody pumped them up with an air hose.'' 'A Matter of Pride'\nIf the ban on steroids was followed in the N.F.L., Golic said, ''There would be a lot of offensive linemen playing indoor soccer next year. They'd look like raisins. ''Obviously, the people who are doing the steroids have a mentality that is wrong because they are trying to push themselves past a point that is natural for them.\n''I look at it as a matter of pride. If I took steroids, and I got big and I got strong and I got fast and I went out and I made the Pro Bowl, I might be happy.\n''But I would also know that is wasn't me. It wasn't natural. I had to do something unnatural to get there. That would be hard to accept, but of course there are guys who can. They got there and that's all that matters.''\nWith the Browns, Golic has come a long way. He started as a nose tackle for the first time against the Los Angeles Raiders in the 1982 playoffs and soon met Gene Upshaw, the 6-foot-6, 275-pound guard who is now director of the players' union.\nGolic called for a pass-rush switch that had him looping around from the outside.\n''I come around the corner and I think, 'Hey, this is going to be easy.' '' he said. ''But Upshaw's standing back there. It looks like he's been waiting a week, waiting for me.\n''I think about all these moves I'm going to make on him. I put my head down and drive into his chest. He didn't move. I immediately went from a 6-3 to a 6-2 nose tackle.''\nGolic improved quickly, and by the end of the 1983 season he was voted a Pro Bowl alternate. This season was another good one but it lacked one element.\n''I didn't get any quarterback sacks,'' said Golic. ''I had my hand on the guy a few times and I told the coaches to give me at least a half-sack. No.\n''One of our guys said, 'If you'd had just one sack you might have been defensive player of the year.' ''\nGolic is good enough so that opponents see to it that he is blocked at least twice and sometimes three times. ''I get hit from all directions,'' he said. ''That's my job.''\nGolic likes his head coach, Marty Schottenheimer, because of his enthusiasm.\n''As you get farther along in the game,'' he said, ''you have a tendency sometimes to look at it as a business, go to the office, do your job, go home, get the paycheck.\n''Being a Notre Dame guy, I'm into the rah-rah, let's get fired up. Marty brings an emotionalism to the game.\n''It's not the screaming and yelling which he does sometimes. You can see him when he's talking, the muscles in the jaw tighten, the eyes get a little wet. You can see the emotion there. This game means everything. That gets me going. And there's a bunch of other guys who feel the same way.'' N.F.L. PLAYOFFS
66	Books of The Times; Voice From the Theater	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DE103CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: WRITING IN RESTAURANTS. By David Mamet. 160 pages. Viking. $15.95.\nWRITING IN RESTAURANTS. By David Mamet. 160 pages. Viking. $15.95.\nIt was as a child in a Chicago schoolyard that David Mamet first recognized words as ''magical and powerful unto themselves,'' whether used for insult, imprecation, arbitration or, as is the case with the adult Mamet, for dramatic poetry. On the strength of his theatrical body of work, plays that include ''American Buffalo'' and the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' Mr. Mamet has become one of our most astute and distinctive playwrights. That he is also a fine essayist is a fact that, until now, has been something of a secret.\nHis new book, ''Writing in Restaurants,'' is a collection of articles, speeches, commentaries and introductions to plays, some of which may have been written in restaurants. But there is nothing random about the anthology (and there are no gravy stains on his ideas). Although the pieces deal with such diverse subjects as play-writing, poker, pool halls and family vacations, there is a unifying thread. Above all, Mr. Mamet is a moralist, a man who is dedicated to differentiating truth from trash.\nOften he returns to Stanislavsky, holding him up as a humanist and a figure of artistic probity. On occasion, the Russian director shares stage space with an ancient seer or a bit of folk wisdom, as in this observation: ''There is a homily popularly attributed to the Chinese to the effect that the time one spends fishing is not deducted from one's life span. This may or may not be true of fishing . . . but it is certainly not true of the theater. The time one spends in a theater - whether as spectator or as worker - is deducted from one's total allotment, and this is what Stanislavsky had in mind when he said, 'Play well, or play badly, but play truly.' ''\nFrom Mr. Mamet's perspective, the Philistines have all but destroyed his favored profession. Production, meaning overproduction, has been ''the death of the American theater'' - one reason he continues to find a theatrical sanctuary in writing radio plays. Broadway has priced itself out of presenting new plays; it now costs $750,000 to put on a three-character, one-set drama. Broadening the attack, he adds about the movies, his other major livelihood, ''They aren't administered by Miss Dove, but by people interested solely in making a buck on the buck they have put out.'' The problem, of course, is not simply financial. He sees an instability in the theatrical life of such huge proportion that it supports Camus's comparison of the actor to Sisyphus.\nWhile Mr. Mamet and his colleagues push their boulders up the mountain, lurking on the other side are the critics in ambush. Surprisingly, considering his outspoken public statements on the subject, in print he seems to have tempered his hostility. In a speech to theater critics, he advises them to ''write for yourself, and be an artist'' rather than a ''weather vane and reporter to the public taste'' - and tells them how to do it.\nHe is as demanding on the playwright, on himself as playwright, as he is on actors and critics. ''Every time the author leaves in a piece of nonessential prose (beautiful though it may be),'' he writes, ''he weakens the structure of the play.'' It is at least partly as an act of self-criticism for him to state that it is ''much easier to write great dialogue'' than it is ''to write great plots'' - although one must add that there is far more in Mr. Mamet's art than meets the ear. At the same time, still a schoolyard lawyer, he sees the theater as a court of last resort. A play, by his measure, ''is a strict lesson in ethics,'' a definition that finds support in Mr. Mamet's own plays.\nThe Mamet Bureau of Standards and Practices also operates in the world outside the theater. He describes the frustration he felt when he tried to tell a bank teller that she had accidently given him $2,500 after he had deposited a check for that amount (no thanks in banks). His poker passion is detailed (in 20 years of playing he has seen very few poor losers but many poor winners). And he reports, with amazement, that a friend wanted to design a down-filled Hawaiian shirt.\nA few of the pieces seem peripheral, and one dealing with ''The Cherry Orchard'' leaves some question as to how much he really admires the play. But the author's batting average as a wordsmith is exceedingly high. In this book, Mr. Mamet acts as a teacher, critic and 20th-century transcendalist, resolutely idealistic as he tries to - to use a favorite Mamet word -inculcate awareness.\nEven dealing with relatively minor matters he can have acute insights, as in his observation that ''only two legitimate national holidays remain,'' times when ''we, as a People, are united'' - the Super Bowl and the Academy Awards. One fantastic story, that of reprisals suffered at the hands of the Dead Man's Lot gang (too long to tell; see page 53), is an object lesson in the limits of altruism. In his Harvard lecture on the subject of ''Decay,'' in and out of the theater, he indicates that identifying a problem does not absolve one of responsibility. ''We are the problem,'' he says, ''like the man driving home from the Hamptons on Sunday night and cursing the idiots who have caused the traffic jam.''

68	PLASTER CASTS OF STATUES: FROM STORAGE INTO VOGUE	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA103CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The vast warehouse storage room is wall-to-wall with plaster replicas of the great sculpture of the Western world - by Michelangelo, Praxiteles and hundreds of others. But the statues stand in crowded rows, their faces chipped and cracked and black with the accumulated grime of decades. Disembodied heads are found by the boxful, and many figures have no lower limbs.\nThe vast warehouse storage room is wall-to-wall with plaster replicas of the great sculpture of the Western world - by Michelangelo, Praxiteles and hundreds of others. But the statues stand in crowded rows, their faces chipped and cracked and black with the accumulated grime of decades. Disembodied heads are found by the boxful, and many figures have no lower limbs.\nIt is the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection of plaster casts -once among the museum's most highly prized treasures but until just a few years ago ignored and crumbling in a leaky storehouse under the West Side Highway in upper Manhattan.\nRecently, however, the casts have benefited from a renaissance of interest among scholars, who increasingly find them worthy of study, restoration and exhibition. Riding this wave of renewed interest, the Met was able last year to transfer the collection to a storage warehouse in the Bronx, and has lent hundreds of the works to museums and universities nationwide.\n''We tried for years, with limited resources and different priorities, to have them restored and placed in academies and schools, but there were no takers,'' said Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum. ''There is no question there was a period of time when there was less interest than at other times. But with this resurgence of interest, we were able to gather up the resources to cope with them. I'd love to see more of them restored and put on loan.''\nA center for the renewed interest in the casts is the Queens Museum, in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. In the mid 1970's, the museum began to restore some of the Met's damaged casts, and today it runs a conservation laboratory exclusively for that purpose. In return for conserving the works, the Queens Museum is granted the right to borrow them on long-term loan. Permanent Exhibition\nLast April, the Queens Museum opened a permanent exhibition of 22 of the restored plaster casts, including those of the Venus de Milo, the Belvedere Torso and eight sculptures by Michelangelo, including the Florentine Pieta, the Dawn and Dusk figures from the Medici Chapel and the Dying Slave.\n''We're looking at a real revolution in taste,'' said Janet Schneider, the director of the Queens Museum. ''After World War II, modern artists were seeking to negate the dominant Western classical tradition, and casts were a symbol of that tradition. Many of them were destroyed. But now, in 1986, there's a whole new generation of artists who never saw a cast. They've been away so long they begin to look new.''\nAmong the other institutions that have borrowed plaster casts from the Metropolitan Museum are Princeton University, Carnegie Mellon University and the New York Academy of Art, a school in Manhattan that uses a curriculum based on Renaissance and Beaux-Arts principles.\nThe new interest in plaster casts, most experts agree, is yet another expression of ''post-modern'' taste, which extends beyond pure abstract art to an interest in a variety of historical styles, ranging from figurative and expressionist art to the architectural use of classical figures and decorations.\nOriginally, plaster casts were the most prized holdings of major American museums, which in the 19th century collected them in the belief that masterpieces of European classical art and architecture would never be available - or affordable. Casting Teams\nIn the late 19th century, the great museums of Europe, such as the Louvre and the British Museum, made casts of the original works in their collections to sell to American museums and collectors; at other times, American museums commissioned teams of craftsmen to make casts from the originals.\nIn the early 20th century, however, as American fortunes grew and many in Europe dwindled, masterpieces began to flow to the west. A taste for originals came to dominate, and casts were put in storage or destroyed en masse until, by the 1940's, virtually none were on view.\nThe fragility of the plaster casts made their storage perilous, and the Met's collection was no exception. In the 158th Street storehouse, the sculptures were often piled atop one another. Wind, leaky roofs and vibrations from traffic all took their toll.\nThe turnabout began around 1975, when the Queens Museum requested, and received, the loan of several casts from the Met. In return, the smaller museum agreed to restore the works, and a conservation studio was formed for that purpose.\nThe restoration project stalled in the late 70's for lack of funds but was revived in 1983 with a $150,000 grant from the Chase Manhattan Bank. In June 1985, with the encouragement of Mayor Koch, $100,000 in city funds were allocated to the restoration program, and later that year, as part of a highway construction project, the city paid for the transportation of the casts from the West Side Highway site to the Bronx. Multiprocess Cleaning\nToday, the Queens Museum conservation laboratory is working on more than 350 borrowed casts. A team of four can take up to a month on a major piece, at an average cost of between $10,000 and $20,000. The process involves soaking the surface with a mild solvent, gently scraping off the dirt, then painting and polishing the statue.\nAccording to Ms. Schneider, the casts are not without their detractors - ''many people still consider them duller than death'' - but their assets outweigh their limitations. She said that since many of the casts, such as those of the Parthenon frieze, were made before pollution decayed the original works, they actually showed far more detail than the current originals.\nThe casts have proved popular with many artists.\nGeorge Segal, the contemporary sculptor who works in roughly modeled plaster, recently visited the plaster-cast replicas of Michelangelo's Medici Chapel sculptures at the New York Academy of Art.\n''Nobody stops you when you run your hand over the musculature,'' said Mr. Segal. ''One of the primary experiences of being a sculptor is physical tangibility, being able to see and touch. I thought it was magnificent to encounter a Michelangelo cast that way. These experiences are remarkably rich.''

She said, ''Imagine spending time in a different room every day of the year!'' Since the alternative, a studio apartment at Lincoln Center with an eat-in closet, cost the same $16.4 million, we bought the castle.\n''The kitchen is original,'' said the broker when we arrived last Jan. 1. ''It dates to 1300, when the Medicis moved in - they had first refusal -so it needs a little work.'' After inspecting the ancient kitchen layout -nine pantries, buttery, butchery, bakery, silver vault, salad bar and takeout counter - we agreed, and installed a hot plate in the baronial winter dining room next to the three-ox spit. My wife wanted one in the summer dining room, too, but I said two hot plates were a waste of money.\nIn the glassed-in cloister, we studied the kitchen garden, with its Asti spumante fountains watering tortellini bushes, and rows of cannelloni alla toscana around a minestrone pond where some prosciutto grazed peacefully.\nThe broker told us, ''In the year 800, Charlemagne lived in this fortification, just after it was built.'' That night, I encountered Charlemagne's ghost on the loggia. He said, ''I've walked these halls for 1,172 winters, so maybe I can give you a household tip.'' I said, ''What is it?'' He said, ''Get central heating fast.''\nA week later, after touring all 365 rooms, I felt we needed a finished basement. My wife wondered what for. I said, ''Just a conversation piece.'' So we furnished the game room with a stadium-size gridiron and a canasta table in case my aunt from Mamaroneck visited.\nWhen my wife, joking, asked how we could afford such palatial splendor, I said, ''We'll do what the leftover English aristocracy does to rescue country houses - put in a restaurant.'' Pointing to the castle's crenelated facade, I explained, ''Above that 14th-century clock, next to the Bernini angel, we'll hang a neon sign that flashes 'Eats.' ''\nLife hit a low point when the restaurant's custom dinner service displaying our coat of arms in gold arrived from Limoges. I checked the motto and found a typographical error: ''Don't Thread on Me.''\nBusiness aside, our No. 1 problem was the 299 bedrooms - and no bathrooms. We bought a rollaway bed and dressers on casters so they could be moved from bedroom to bedroom every day. Each morning, we are carried down two flights on a sedan chair to the bath in the knights' hall; this is hard on the help, because we have only one upstairs servant.\nWe were embarrassed at our first banquet. It is somewhat inconvenient for early-departing guests when 250 coats are piled on one bed, especially when three drinks make you forget where the bed is that day. Since then, guests have entered through the armory, where there are 500 antlers, and hang up their own: moose for men's coats, deer for women's.\nAt breakfast one day, my wife clicked on the microphone at her end of the refectory table and said, ''What should we do with the empty 400-foot by 600-foot Grand Salon?'' I was baffled: ''Which room is that?''\nShe answered in a flash: ''That three-story one with the pediments carved by Norman artisans resting on mock-Corinthian capitals above Carrara marble pilasters. The one with the Gothic vaulting in Moorish domes in the manner of Bramante. The one with trompe l'oeil bas reliefs offsetting Flemish black-and-white checkerboard paving edged by arabesques.''\n''Oh,'' I said. ''That one. Let's make it the den.''\nWe cut the travel between the castle's east and west wings to 15 minutes by installing two one-car IRT trains, built to scale. The system, under the picture gallery, works well, although the express often arrives on the local track. Of course, we never use it at night.\nWe modernized the throne room's bell pull. One yank of the ceiling-high brocade sash still brings the falconer, and two yanks, the scribe; but three gets us the computer repairman; four, the sommelier with Chianti, and five, a delivery of ''pizza everything'' (five and a half means ''hold the pepperoni'').\nThe dungeon was impossible; we couldn't do a thing with it except hang dehumidifers from the manacles.\nOur moat is a godsend. Each night after we park we hoist the drawbridge; the car radio has never been stolen again. Actually, there are two moats - fresh and salt water - one stocked with carp (we sell to the Chinese restaurants in Montepulciano), the other with maatjes herring (for our Sunday mornings).\nBy the eighth month, homesick for apartment-house ways, we hired a superintendent - fully expecting him to ignore crucial repairs. (He does.) Should we have moved to Lincoln Center? No. Our mahogany-paneled library has become the entertainment center. From speakers under El Greco's pastel idylls of prancing nymphs, music flows: Gregorian chants, Fats Waller singing ''Ain't Misbehavin'.'' Wearing smoking jacket and bunny slippers, I watch the giant TV screen that drops over the self-portrait Czar Nicholas II gave my grandfather as an emigration gift.\nIn the last 365 days, we've had problems: criticism of our new mural over the grand staircase, ''The Mets' Gary Carter Traps a Pop Fly at the Visitors' Dugout''; the $5,000 Windex bill for the Hall of Mirrors, and landscaping cost overruns for the 400 acres of Astroturf.\nThe road to Florence lies beyond the sequoias we imported from California, our private zoo's lion pit (which frightens the postman) and a replica of the Triborough Bridge we erected over a sweet brook. ''We need a mailbox,'' I said. ''How about japanned tin mounted on two plaster griffins with acanthus-leaf wings? They can spray green water skyward whenever we get a bank statement.''\n''It's a bad idea,'' my wife said. ''The neighbors might think we're nouveaux riches.''

Diplomats estimate that $550 million could be lacking, a similar amount to 1985. Mr. Samojlik said Poland's debt was likely to reach $33.4 billion by the end of 1986.

Toronto-based Campeau's takeover plan specified that each share of Allied common stock that Campeau does not already own will be converted into $69 in cash if the takeover was completed by yesterday.\nCampeau, one of Canada's biggest real estate developers, already owned 27.9 million Allied shares as of yesterday. It had bought 25.8 million shares in a block for $67 a share, for a total price of about $1.73 billion. The price paid for the other 2 million or so shares was not available, a Campeau spokesman said. There were 52.3 million shares of Allied stock outstanding on Dec. 1, so Campeau had some 24.4 million shares left to purchase at the agreed-upon price of $69 apiece, or about $1.68 billion. The acquisition - based on the amounts Campeau has already spent and will spend -will cost about $3.5 billion.\nCOMPANY NEWS
72	FURNITURE SALES OFF, KNOLL IS REGROUPING	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D8103CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: HIT by a severe slump in the demand for office furniture, Knoll International, the New York-based designer and manufacturer of modern furniture for offices and homes, is undergoing a restructuring that so far has cost an estimated 200 jobs and prompted the company to buy back the stock it issued less than four years ago in its first public offering.\nHIT by a severe slump in the demand for office furniture, Knoll International, the New York-based designer and manufacturer of modern furniture for offices and homes, is undergoing a restructuring that so far has cost an estimated 200 jobs and prompted the company to buy back the stock it issued less than four years ago in its first public offering.\nOnce a highly specialized company that concentrated on reproducing masterpieces of modern furniture for a select group of customers, Knoll in the last decade has tried to move into the far larger market for mass-produced office systems. As recently as two years ago the office furniture business was expanding by almost 20 percent annually. Lawrence R. Ryan, then Knoll's president and chief executive officer, announced in November 1985 that the company wanted to increase its share of the mass market from about 3 percent to 10 percent.\nIn the past year, however, an oversupply of office space and widespread uncertainty about the economic climate have resulted in a severe cutback in orders for new furniture. ''It used to be a tremendous growth market but it's plateaued,'' said Stanley Lanzet, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Big companies are very stingy in committing orders while they're uneasy about the economy. And office furniture is a highly deferrable item.''\nFrederick Marcus, a member of Knoll's board as well as director of financial relations, concurred. ''There has been a real deceleration in orders from corporate America,'' he said. ''The hardest hit have been the large contracts, the new corporate headquarters.''\nMr. Marcus said Knoll's strength had always been with architects and designers. ''We were weakest at the dealer level, working with the everyday, grind-it-out pieces,'' he said. ''It's going to take us two to four years to establish a presence in the dealer community, while our competitors are well entrenched and have been doing it right for 10 to 15 years.'' Steelcase Inc. of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Herman Miller Inc. of Zeeland, Mich., together control some 50 per cent of the large-contract office furniture business. Since the early 70's Knoll has put more and more of its effort and prestige behind a series of office systems, coordinated sets of desks, chairs, filing cabinets, wall panels and shelves designed to accomodate computer hardware and its complex wiring.\nMr. Marcus said the company was changing emphasis and many of the people who have left ''were not interested in working with the dealers.'' Among the casualties was Mr. Ryan. ''Larry's talents were optimized when levels of demand kept increasing,'' Mr. Marcus said, ''and his records speak for themselves. He just wasn't familiar with a low-growth environment.'' Most of the staff cuts came in October, said Joyce Clark, a company spokesman.\nMel Stuart, who succeeded Mr. Ryan, was president of Knoll International WorldTrade Inc., the company's foreign subsidiary, in a period when the overseas market was a ''low-growth environment,'' Mr. Marcus said.\nKnoll was founded in 1938 by Hans Knoll, a German immigrant whose family had made furniture in Germany designed by the Bauhaus School. In the years after World War II Mr. Knoll and his wife, Florence, revolutionized office design by popularizing the furniture of Marcel Breuer, Mies van der Rohe and Eero Saarinen. Mr. Knoll died in 1955, and in 1977 Mrs. Knoll sold the company to General Felt Industries of Saddle Brook, N.J. In l983 Knoll raised $45 million in its first public sale of stock, and used much of the money to finance its entry into the mass-produced office systems business. One analyst described the move in 1985 as ''a Cadillac moving down to the Oldsmobile part of the business.''\nIt is those shares that the company is currently buying back for $12 a share. The current price is about $11.50. The stock, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange, reached a high of $20.38 in the first quarter of 1986. Mr. Marcus said there were roughly 3.23 million shares outstanding, about half of them held by institutions and half by private investors. The tentative expiration date for the buy-back offer is Jan. 15. Mr. Marcus said he expected the offer to be fully subscribed.\nMr. Marcus said Knoll decided on the buy-back ''because to protect the core of our employees and the core of our business, we realized we were going to have to make a series of decisions that would have a negative near-term impact on earnings.''

But Joy rejected both offers as inadequate and accepted the investor group's bid on Dec. 22. Under its agreement with\nJoy, Pullman-Peabody said it would tender the nearly one million Joy common shares it already owned to the investor group, which was formed by Adler & Shaykin, a New York investment firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts.\nThe agreement also calls for litigation between the companies to be dropped, and for Joy to pay $750,000 to Pullman-Peabody to help cover Pullman-Peabody's expenses in connection with its failed offer.\nPittsburgh-based Joy is a maker of oilfield and petroleum equipment and coal-mining machinery. Pullman-Peabody, based in Princeton, supplies material-handling and food service equipment, and makes components for the aerospace and communications industries.\nThe investor group's tender offer for Joy's stock is due to expire Jan. 26. Joy's stock closed at $34.75 a share today, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange trading.\nCOMPANY NEWS

It was the third increase of\nVenezuela's crude oil and fourth for its oil products since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided earlier this month to reduce production and raise prices to an average of $18 a barrel.\nIn Egypt, an oil ministry official said that January prices would go up on all grades of its exported oil by $1.35 a barrel. Egypt is not a member of\nOPEC but sets its prices according to the world market.\nThe official said the OPEC agreement had improved world market prices, allowing the rise in Egyptian prices. The price of Egypt's top-grade Gulf of Suez blend was increased to $16.60 a barrel.

Perks for management - even special parking spaces - are out and egalitarianism is in.\nAs president and chief executive, David L. Nelson has fostered an unusual culture at the Accuray Corporation. All employees are called associates and part of their salary is based on an incentive program. Perks for management - even special parking spaces - are out and egalitarianism is in.\nBut employees worry that this could change as two larger companies, Hercules Inc. and Combustion Engineering Inc., bid for the Columbus, Ohio, company. ''It's really a shame to see us going from an independent corporation to a division of a larger company,'' said Glenn Ostel, a company spokesman, ''because it's such a unique company.''\nHercules has said, however, that it will run the company as an independent operation with current management, and Combustion Engineering has said it is seeking the company under terms similar to those offered by Hercules. So there is a chance that Mr. Nelson's innovations will survive under a parent company. On Tuesday, Combustion Engineering raised its offer to $45 a share, or a total of $214 million, compared with a $40-a-share offer from Hercules.\nAccuray was founded in 1950 and grew from three employees to 2,000 and revenues of $150 million. It makes sophisticated equipment to measure products as they are being made and then controls the production process, improving quality and productivity. The company's main customers make paper, plastics, metals and cigarettes.\nMr. Nelson, 55 years old, has been with the company since 1956 and has worked in engineering, sales and administration. He holds a bachelor of science degree from Iowa State University and was a Marine captain from 1952 to 1954. He has been president since 1967 and chief executive since 1970.\nMr. Nelson was dealing with the acquisition offers yesterday and unavailable for an interview.\nMr. Ostel said Mr. Nelson was popular among employees, and one reason was that he strives to do away with anything ''that smacks of perks or a caste system or anything like that.'' At a senior management meeting, the spokesman said, it came to Mr. Nelson's attention that vice presidents had their own parking places and within an hour the ''reserved'' signs were taken down.\nMr. Nelson and the company's No. 2 man, Christopher J. Campbell, 58, executive vice president and chief operating officer, ''have defined the culture of Accuray,'' Mr. Ostel said.\n''We really enjoy doing what we do and have the freedom to do it,'' Mr. Ostel said. ''That's why the company is attracting these bids. We're all very flattered.'' BUSINESS PEOPLE
76	Long-Term Bond Prices Fall	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D6103CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Government securities dealers spent yesterday's abbreviated session marking down prices of long-term Treasury bonds and raising those on intermediate maturities.\nGovernment securities dealers spent yesterday's abbreviated session marking down prices of long-term Treasury bonds and raising those on intermediate maturities.\nAs a partial explanation of yesterday's activity, dealers said they were expecting more institutional and other bond investors to shorten the maturities in their portfolios when they start to return to the market next week.\nThe market was also unsettled by bearish economic news: The Government reported a record $19.2 billion trade deficit, and the dollar fell to a new six-year low against the West German mark. Sentiment was not helped by the continued rise in oil prices and the sharp $15-an-ounce surge in gold, which sent bullion prices above the $400 mark once again.\nWhether or not these factors signal inflation, the bane of bond holders, or are merely short-term phenomena, the bond market took the prudent course of adjusting positions yesterday.\nAs a result, the offered price of the bellwether long Treasury bond, the 7.5 percent issue due in 2016, closed down 17/32, at 100 7/32, for a yield of 7.48 percent, compared with 7.44 percent the previous day.\nAlso at 2 P.M., when trading in government securities ended yesterday, the price of long Treasury notes, such as the 7 1/4 percent issue of 1996, was down 8/32, or a quarter-point, at 100 5/32, and now yields 7.23 percent, compared with 7.20 percent the day before.\nBut the shortening of maturities helped raise the price of the 6 1/4 percent issue of 1988 by 3/32, to 99 28/32, for a yield of 6.32 percent. The 6 5/8 percent issue of 1990 closed unchanged at 99 21/32, a yield of 6.72 percent, and the 7 percent notes of January 1994, which the Treasury auctioned Tuesday at an average yield of 7.09 percent, closed unchanged yesterday at an offered price of 99 18/32.\nAs expected, the end of the quarter and the year caused a last-minute flurry of Treasury bill purchases by corporations, mutual funds and other institutions seeking to show large cash positions on their final accounts for 1986.\nThis traditional ''window-dressing'' helped shave three basis points off the discount rate of 90-day Treasury bills, which closed at 5.68 percent; the six-month bill rate fell four basis points, to 5.64 percent, and the one-year bills closed at 5.63, down nine basis points.\nAlso expected was the abnormally high Federal funds, or overnight interbank lending, rate, which opened at 30 percent and broke sharply to 9 percent just before the 2 P.M. close. Aside from the usual heavy demand for window-dressing and other funds on Dec. 31, yesterday was the end of the two-week bank reserve settlement period, when many banks scramble to meet various reserve requirements. Yesterday was also the settlement day for the $18 billion of notes auctioned by the Treasury last week.\nDealers were surprised by the timing of the Fed's intervention in the market, which occurred at 10 A.M, or more than an hour earlier than normal. In any case, the Fed's direct injection of reserves into the banking system, effected by two-day system repurchase agreements, came when the funds rate was 20 percent.\nThe credit market is closed today. Tomorrow, the credit market, which normally has no fixed closing hour, will again end at 2 P.M.\nCREDIT MARKETS
77	ARTS GROUPS SEEK ETHNICALLY BROADER AUDIENCE	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6103CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: As the ethnic composition of New York City changes with the arrival of Hispanic, black and Asian immigrants, local arts organizations are beginning to try to reach out to new audiences.\nAs the ethnic composition of New York City changes with the arrival of Hispanic, black and Asian immigrants, local arts organizations are beginning to try to reach out to new audiences.\nThe New York State Council on the Arts, for example, has just announced a pilot project to try to diversify the ethnic composition of audiences of cultural institutions by the year 2000 to reflect the changes in the composition of the state's population.\n''Since 1965, New York State has witnessed dramatic population shifts resulting from new immigrants,'' said Kitty Carlisle Hart, chairman of the council. ''Nearly one in three New Yorkers is a recent immigrant to the country. The greatest number of our newest citizens come from the Caribbean, Latin America and Southeast Asia, but these numbers are not reflected in the audiences of New York's cultural institutions and we believe this should change.''\nThe council will distribute $243,288 to nine institutions to start outreach programs that could become models for other organizations. The institutions in New York City are Ballet Hispanico, Museum of the City of New York, the New York Philharmonic, the Queens Symphony Orchestra and the Studio Museum of Harlem.\nAlso awarded grants were the Albany Institute of History and Arts, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Metropolitan School for the Arts in Onondaga County and the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra. The projects include discussions and seminars, hiring marketing and promotion experts, offering reduced ticket prices at performances, creating new multicultural events to attract a more diverse audience and scheduling concerts in upstate New York in communities that would not otherwise have them. $1.5 Million Being Sought Mrs. Hart said the council was asking the State Legislature for $1.5 million next year to expand the project to include other institutions throughout the state. She said that the council, through this project, recognized that cultural organizations needed the patronage and appreciation of the public and that the public needed the institutions as well.\nTucker Ashworth, a spokesman for the City Planning Department, said the city's non-Hispanic white population declined from 63 percent of the total population in the 1970 census to 51.9 percent in the 1980 census. But according to a recent analysis of population samples by John D. Kasarda, chairman of the sociology department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, blacks, Hispanics and Asians already constitute a majority of city residents.\nEdward Kresky, vice chairman of the council, who with Mrs. Hart and others helped start the council's pilot project, said recent articles in The New York Times about New York City's changing population had been the catalyst for the effort. Mr. Kresky, who held a symposium on audience diversification last spring at New York University, said: ''We have ethnic groups that are entirely new, and the percentage of our population aged 60 and over has vastly increased. In our symphony halls in the state we have an audience that is primarily white and is older than I recall when I was a young concertgoer. Our museums have to reach out more into ethnic arts than they have in the past. There has to be more of a move into the community and back and forth.''\n''It's very important that the arts council break some new ground in this area,'' he said. ''We have had a great growth in numbers of institutions. We need equal growth in the numbers of audiences if the organizations are going to survive. Some of the people we're seeking to reach have never had the experience of taking their children to concerts or museums. There are economic hurdles, but if they'll go and feel comfortable with things they are attunded to ethnically, hopefully they will broaden their interests into others areas.'' Concerts in Harlem\nThe New York Philharmonic, which received a $30,000 grant, began its community outreach program seven years ago with concerts at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and will continue with concerts, seminars and discussions in Harlem and other communities.\nSuch programs occasionally run into snags when politics and the arts mix. Last month, more than a third of the New York Philharmonic refused to play at a free concert at the church because one of its ministers, a supporter of the Black Muslim minister Louis Farrakhan, would not denounce anti-Semitic statements Mr. Farrakhan made last year. The concert took place anyway.\nThe next New York Philharmonic concert in Harlem will be Jan. 5, 1988, at the renovated Apollo Theater and will be conducted by Zubin Mehta, according to Daniel J. Windham, director of educational activities at the Philharmonic. The move to the Apollo was not related to the incident at the church, Mr. Windham said, but reflected the intention of the Philharmonic to try to reach a larger Harlem audience.\n''It's a part of our mandate and policy to be a cultural institution for all of the city and its inhabitants,'' Mr. Windham said. ''Historically, people have not come, perhaps because it's unfamiliar territory or they may have felt they were not wanted. Those perceptions are pretty longstanding, and it's up to the institution to try to break down those barriers.'' A Sense of Proprietorship\nDr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, executive director of the Studio Museum of Harlem, which received a $45,000 grant for its program to develop new audiences, said some people forget the pluralistic nature of society and the need to try to include its many different facets in cultural life.\n''One of the reasons minorities don't participate as much is that they don't have a sense of cultural proprietorship at the traditional institutions,'' Dr. Campbell said. ''Blacks, Hispanics and Asians have rich cultural traditions. They are all very complex. There is a real need for them to be able to have a sense of ownership over their own culture and own cultural prerogatives. They are not permitted to at a lot of mainstream cultural institutions.''\n''An institution is a place that has to have a role for people, people to be volunteers, to come to events, to help run the institutions so that they become their home, their places,'' she continued. ''If traditional institutions are going to be successful, they have to begin to involve minority population in ways to make them feel truly part of the institution, not just as an audience. Anything is possible with imaginative leadership, and that's just what it will take.''
78	IN DESIGN TRENDS, A GLANCE BACK AND HINTS OF '87	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF113CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: IN the opening scene of the movie ''Ruthless People,'' Sam Stone, played by Danny DeVito, plots the death of his wife, Barbara (Bette Midler), an obstreperous Beverly Hills matron. ''God I hate that woman,'' he rants. ''I hate the way she licks stamps. I hate her furniture!''\nIN the opening scene of the movie ''Ruthless People,'' Sam Stone, played by Danny DeVito, plots the death of his wife, Barbara (Bette Midler), an obstreperous Beverly Hills matron. ''God I hate that woman,'' he rants. ''I hate the way she licks stamps. I hate her furniture!''\n''I hate her furniture!'' may be the most telling line of 1986. The furniture in question was in the Italian avant-garde Memphis style, and Mr. DeVito's character may have been speaking for many when he uttered this impassioned critique of Italian 'nuovo' design.\nThat Memphis furniture wound up as a comic device in a Hollywood movie says a lot about the year 1986. There were no Italian gurus creating never-before-seen furniture forms, no one all-embracing movement like post-modernism to hang stylistic hats upon.\nInstead, 1986 was a year in which comfort, expressed through the use of natural materials and in furniture that was rarely outrageous, took center stage. It was a year in which Witold Rybczynski, a Canadian architect, wrote ''Home: A Short History of an Idea,'' a cultural inquiry into comfort. The book confirmed the reactions of Danny DeVito's Sam Stone, a design victim if ever there was one. Bill Stumpf, a Minneapolis furniture designer, says ''Home'' is about the major design issue of the 80's, adding, ''A broader sense of physical comfort is something we've denied for many years.''\nAmong designers themselves, 1986 may be ultimately remembered as the year in which the profession lost two of its leading lights, George Nelson and Raymond Loewy. Mr. Loewy's streamlined forms optimistically expressed the spirit of the machine age. An expert at packaging images, including his own, he predated the current cult of personality and may have been America's first designer superstar. George Nelson, in addition to being a furniture designer, was an irascible critic who suffered fools poorly and was fond of saying, ''We live in a society saturated with visual illiterates.''\nTheir deaths were a major loss. But many of their concerns live on in a feast of books and exhibitions that celebrate design - not as a profession dedicated to making designer teakettles, but as the stuff of daily life, past and present. At the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, ''Milestones: 50 Years of Goods and Services'' cast its eye on 50 important everyday artifacts, from power mowers to air-conditioners. In his book ''Populuxe,'' Thomas Hine fondly examined the ebullience of the 1950's and the early 60's, from the Miami Beach hotel architect Morris Lapidus to the ridged potato chip. At the Brooklyn Museum, a major exhibition, ''The Machine Age in America 1918-1941'' celebrates the heyday of futuristic streamlined design.\nThe amount of time it takes for anything historical to undergo a revival seems to be shrinking every year. Though the 1950's, 40's, 30's and even the 60's continued to be trendy, above all 1986 was the year of ''Vienna 1900,'' and Josef Hoffmann became firmly established as an icon. In addition to the ''Vienna 1900'' exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, new reproductions and knockoffs of ''W.W.'' (for Wiener Werkstatte) abounded. At the Metropolitan Museum, ''In Pursuit of Beauty: Americans and the Esthetic Movement'' unveils the not-so-distant treasures of the American esthetic movement. There were more reproductions of Frank Lloyd Wright. In a rather sobering commentary on the historic preservation movement, the antiques dealer Margot Johnson predicted that architectural elements from lost buildings by Louis Sullivan and by Frank Lloyd Wright will be among next year's hot design collectibles.\nAt the designer show houses, those faithful bastions of decorating luxury, opulence was the operative word. It reached its peak, perhaps, at the Southampton designer show house, where decorators went into a fringe frenzy - one room featuring an improbable 82 yards of fringe. The use of chintz, while it will always be with us, may have crested for now, as might faux finishes. Last year, design formality was found in the use of rich fabrics such as silks, satins, heavy velvets, jacquards. Some window treatments were so wavy they made one yearn for Dramamine.\nOutside, there was a wealth of status garden furniture, especially the English teak bench and a proliferation of the British perennial flower border. Gardening continued to be the subject of probing cocktail conservation such as ''Are your hemerocallis blooming a week earlier this year?''\nOutside and in, the look was rich, ''the richer the better,'' in the words of the decorator Mario Buatta, who added, ''Houses are becoming imitative of King Ludwig of Bavaria.''\nIf there was a bridge between old money and the masses, it was to be found in the home furnishings of Ralph Lauren. From his new Polo shop on Madison Avenue, Mr. Lauren purveys the image of the mythical comforts of home - an image of people sipping Sherry on a squishy sofa beside a roaring fire, beagles at hand. His influence could be found at the Southern Furniture Market in High Point, N.C., last fall, where new designs were old-looking, comfortable and above all nonthreatening: chaises, daybeds, sprawling oversized chairs - lots of stripped pine and wicker.\nMr. Lauren creates a personal vision of comfort. In 1986 industrial designers, too, wrestled with the idea of comfort, in not-so-rarefied products. Cousins Design in New York, for example, introduced kitchen ovens for Thermador that featured ''friendly'' squishy polyurethane knobs and handles. The Sharp Corporation continued to inject comforting elements into its products - whimsical pink microwave ovens and curvaceous sea-foam green radios.\nThough 1986 was not a year for pervasive trends, new directions could be detected, particularly in the expressive use of materials. The new year should see continued use of patinaed metal, wrought iron, galvanized steel, oxidized copper and the deliberate use of distressed surfaces to express age and romance. ''The machine ethic did not allow imperfection,'' notes the designer John Saladino, remarking on the preponderance of fake water stains and mottled textures.\nSome see an inexorable swing of the pendulum - a return to materials left in their natural state, a sort of design equivalent of health food. The new offices of the designers Massimo and Lella Vignelli, for example, sport waxed lead walls, sandblasted glass panes and a raw steel table. At the restaurant Coastal, to open later this year, the designer Sam Lopata - the man known for his use of tile and mirror and the phrase ''noise is theater'' - will be using simple natural materials, including wood chairs and unvarnished floors.\nAt the very least, the use of natural materials seemed to signal a new communion among design, craft and art. According to Massimo Vignelli, contemporary artists like Richard Serra and Donald Judd have been influential in their pioneering use of materials. Designers' inspiration now ''comes from the arts rather than other designers,'' he said.\nAt Zona, a Santa Fe-style store in SoHo, the natural look reaches some sort of apogee as urbanites pull up in Saabs and Mercedeses to buy birch-bark and willow Ojibwa baskets, forged iron candlesticks and shapely bundles of twigs.\nAs in years past, 1987 should also see the proliferation of the so-called ''design object.'' Following in the footsteps of the Tizio lamp, next year's most sought-after status symbol may very well be the 23-piece, $4,000 Alessi cookware set also designed by Richard Sapper. Seven years in the making, it is a collaboration between Mr. Sapper and six of the world's most illustrious chefs.\nIt is a state-of-the-art design not likely to be used by Mr. Sapper. ''Cook?'' he asks. ''All I can do is brew tea, boil an egg and grill steak.''

Whether the eve was one of unrestrained indulgence or prayerful participation in a watch-night service, something in between or a combination thereof, the day allows for leisure and for genuine sociability.\nIn fact, being sociable on New Year's Day is a tradition. And at the Old Merchants House the tradition is annually upheld with a ''Social Calling in Old New York'' observance. Between 1 and 6 P.M. today the public is invited to visit this 155-year-old building at 29 West Fourth Street. This was the home of the Seabury Tredwell family from 1835 to 1935; his mother was a descendant of Priscilla Mullins and John Alden, of Mayflower fame.\nIn a 10-year task that ended in 1980, the house was restored. Significantly, the original house is all there. There are ancient chandeliers whose light was fueled by whale oil. There is the silver, china, glass, fans, pressed flowers, gowns and other family possessions. For today's open house music will be provided and volunteers and directors will serve refreshments. Admission is $5. Information: 777-1089. 20 CENTS APIECE The 20-year-old Poetry Project's 13th annual New Year's Day benefit is a shoo-in to attract the region's poets. This yearly feast of verse will present 50 poets, performers, dancers, musicians and assorted theatrical people. Their program will begin at 7 P.M. and continue to midnight. The masters of ceremonies are Haoui Montaug of the No Entiendes Cabaret, Two Girls Two (Adele O'Dae and Sybil St. Claire), Carmelita Tropicana and the poets Richard Bandanza and Jessica Hagedorn.\nThe cast will include Allen Ginsberg, Emily XYZ, Anne Waldman, Brad Gooch, Eileen Myles, Bob Holman, Paul Schmidt, Pat Downey, Ray Povod, Pedro Pietri, Maureen Owen, Barbara Barg, Andrei Codrescu, John Giorno, Patricia Jones, Lynne Tillman and Cookie Mueller - all poets and writers. The performers' lineup is scheduled to include Robbie McCauley and Ed Montgomery, the Downtown Divas (Ms. Hagedorn, Deborah Artman and Laurie Carlos), Mary Shultz, Chazz Dean and James Siena, David Cale, Ralph Lemon and Tony Whitfield, Richard Elovich, The Wow Cafe, Nicky Paraiso, Harry Mann and Jim Neu, the Larry Rivers Band, Joseph Jarman and the dancers Yvonne Meier and Yoshiko Chuma.\nFor all 50 the price is $10, which comes to 20 cents apiece. Food and drink will be served. The project's full name is the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church, and that's where this performance will take place - at Second Avenue and 10th Street. Information: 674-0910. HERBIE HANCOCK QUARTET\nFor those who have arrived at this point not satiated by the nightclub environment and who want to hear music, tonight may be an ideal time. At the Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, the group is the Herbie Hancock Quartet. Mr. Hancock, the renowned electronic keyboardist, acoustic pianist and performer in the successful movie '' 'Round Midnight,'' is most often seen and heard in large concert halls. Tonight Mr. Hancock, one of the industry's most successful (and busiest) practitioners, is working a nightclub.\nThe quartet's bassist will be Ron Carter, with whom Mr. Hancock has often worked. The two were fixtures in Mr. Hancock's V.S.O.P., the 1970's quartet that also included Wayne Shorter, the tenor saxophonist, and the drummer Tony Williams. For this engagement, the drummer is Al Foster, who, like Mr. Williams, is an exponent of contemporary mainstream drumming. The saxophonist tonight will be Branford Marsalis, formerly associated with Sting. Mr. Hancock was also a presenter of the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, Branford's brother, in Wynton's early phase.\nTonight's shows are at 9 and 11:30 P.M. The quartet may be heard through Saturday night. There is a $35 music charge tonight, a $5 minimum, or $20 at the bar. Information and reservations: 475-8592.

His appreciation (as one knows it from his lucid books) is not dusty or stern, but many listeners, this one included, find his actual performing style disappointingly cut and dried.\nThe excitement of music for Erich Leinsdorf, who led the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall on Tuesday night, seems to lie more in the understanding, analysis, appreciation of it - as expressed through playing - than in the physical or psychological thrill of performing itself. His appreciation (as one knows it from his lucid books) is not dusty or stern, but many listeners, this one included, find his actual performing style disappointingly cut and dried.\nOne still listens with pleasure, because it is always a pleasure to hear good music confidently handled by someone who understands it and because orchestras tend to play well for Mr. Leinsdorf. Still, Mozart's ''Jupiter'' Symphony did not produce that new experience of wonder that can come with a well-known piece freshly imagined, and the lilt of the shepherds' music from Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio'' was not so evocative of the biblical scene as it has sometimes seemed.\nThe soloist was Yefim Bronfman, who sat down after intermission to play a pair of substantial ''Fantasies'' for piano and orchestra. One was by the young Debussy, who suppressed its publication with some justification. It contains clear pointers toward the kind of music the composer wanted to write, but he had not yet achieved the economy that would purge his later scores of filler music; here, there is too often a sense of sugary, wandering reiteration of ideas. It's pretty, and (except for some passages near the end when overloud horn playing left the strings and Mr. Bronfman sounding puny) it was well performed.\nThe other work was Liszt's ''Hungarian Fantasy,'' in which Mr. Bronfman had a rousing success. At best, as in the unaccompanied beginning of the fast section and a few of the interspersed cadenzas, he treated the music to an elegant, sparkling play of light and shade. He used dynamics liberally to help in shaping phrases, a procedure apparently obvious but one that many pianists neglect to adopt (especially in concerto work). His soft, fast passage work is not the last word in clarity, but it was a pleasure to hear a Liszt player who realized that this is just as important as hard, fast octaves. Mr. Bronfman provided those, too - again, not so stunningly as to give the thrill of virtuosity but more than well enough to serve a fine musical conception of a piece that can be made to sound trashy. Here it sounded utterly enjoyable, and the audience made its agreement with that sentiment clear.\nThen came some of the Viennese desserts traditionally favored by the Philharmonic for the New Year's week: ''Bahn frei'' (''Free passage'') by Eduard Strauss and two favorites by brother Johann, with conductor and audience in suitably cheerful spirits.

Traders sold dollars in response to November's record-shattering trade deficit.\nThe dollar closed out the year on a sour note yesterday, falling sharply to new six-year lows against the West German mark and other European currencies. Traders sold dollars in response to November's record-shattering trade deficit.\nMeanwhile, gold prices, which have been flat for the last few sessions, rose by $14.60 an ounce, to $404.90, in a holiday-shortened trading session at the New York Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a final gold bid for the day of $404 a troy ounce, up from $390 Tuesday.\nThe dollar headed into the new year more than 25 percent lower, on average, than at the end of 1985. The American currency fell steadily during 1986, following the September 1985 decision of the major industrial powers to realign currencies in order to reduce the dollar's value and make American exports more competitive.\nThe dollar's decline yesterday was recorded on light trading. But analysts and traders said the slide presaged a further selloff in the new year.\n''People thought that the beginning of 1987 would see a renewed push on the dollar,'' sending it lower, said Richard E. Witten, a vice president in foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''But today people were just trying to jump the gun.''\nNear the end of the day, the dollar was bid at 1.9190 marks, down 1.5 percent from Tuesday's close. The dollar also reached a new low against the Swiss franc, as it fell to 1.6095 yesterday, down 1 percent from Tuesday.\nCompared with its performance against European currencies, the dollar's decline against the yen was relatively modest. The yen, which has risen by more than 50 percent against the dollar since the end of 1984, was quoted at 158.19 to the dollar, up slightly from Tuesday's close of 159.95. Trade Figure Comes As Shock\nMr. Witten and other traders said that the bulk of the day's activity came within 20 minutes after the November trade figures were announced by the Commerce Department. The $19.2 billion deficit came as a shock; many experts had been expecting a figure in the $14 billion range.\n''If the trade number had been in the $14 billion area, the dollar would have been a little stronger,'' Mr. Witten said. ''But when it came out it told traders not to close their books on the dollar yet.''\nWhile a drop in the dollar generally helps gold prices, yesterday's surge was unexpected, according to some analysts.\n''Gold has been quiet for the past couple of days, in spite of a falling dollar and rising oil prices,'' said John P. Norris, vice president at Citibank Precious Metals. ''But what happened today came as a little bit of a surprise to most of the trade.''\nMr. Norris said that technical factors, and a delayed reaction in the precious metals markets to the dollar's recent decline, were the main reasons for gold's rise yesterday.\nThe continued fall of the dollar against the German mark prompted the Bundesbank's president, Karl Otto Pohl, to say yesterday that further declines would not be in the best interests of the United States, and could pose risks for economic growth in Germany and throughout Europe.\nIn spite of Mr. Pohl's comments, traders remain convinced that further declines are ahead.\n''The emerging trend is that the dollar has to decline more,'' Mr. Witten said, ''say another 5 percent against the mark over the next three months.''

Returning to United States\nAt the State Department in Washington, Phyllis Oakley, a spokesman, said, ''The United States negotiators are returning to the United States to consult in preparation for the next meeting. We feel progress was made.''\nMrs. Oakley said no agreement had been expected today and holding more sessions had been seen as ''a likely outcome,'' although she said no date for resumption was set.\nAssadollah Nouri, the chief Iranian negotiator, said the United States side at The Hague told him no agreement could be reached now because Washington officials were not available over the holiday.\nHe said Iran had expected to conclude the discussions today. At Federal Reserve Bank\nThe $507.7 million represents what is left over, plus interest, in Account No. 1 at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, a $3.66 billion account established with Iranian money in 1981 to pay off syndicated bank loans.\nThe United States delegation ''was supposed to put its final draft for implementation of the award on the table so that we might be able to conclude our negotiations,'' Mr. Nouri said.\n''But without any justification, the United States delegation said to us today that it would not be ready to continue the talks,'' he added.\nMr. Nouri continued, ''They said that their home authorities are not available at this time of the year in Washington so they could not reach them easily to persuade them to sign a final draft.'' Lack of Faith Charged\n''The Government of the United States in implementing the tribunal award has so far not shown its good faith,'' the Iranian negotiator charged.\nNo spokesman was available at the American Embassy to respond to Mr. Nouri's comments.\nLast August, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal ordered return of Account No. 1 funds to Iran. The United States has agreed in principle to the payback.\nThe release of all Iranian assets blocked in the United States, including military equipment, has recently been linked by the Iranian Parliament Speaker, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, to possible Iranian intercession on behalf of American hostages in Lebanon. Funds and Equipment\nIran needs both funds and equipment to pursue its six-year-old war with Iraq.\nToday, however, Prime Minister Mir Hussein Moussavi was quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency as denying any link between the money and the hostages. The report was monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.

He estimated that the United States-backed rebels had suffered 6,600 casualties, including 4,000 deaths.\nThe figures were roughly equal to those the Government presented at the close of 1985.\nMr. Ortega today portrayed the rebel force as shrinking and ''in the process of decomposition.''\n''The army of 30,000 men that President Reagan dreamed of is at this moment reduced to 6,500 mercenaries,'' the Sandinista leader said in an address broadcast live on Nicaraguan radio stations. ''The millions for the mercenary forces have produced nothing.'' Rebel Chief Dispute Figures\nAmerican officials have recently estimated that the number of rebels, who are known as contras, is over 10,000.\nIn a telephone interview from Miami, the head of the largest contra group, Adolfo Calero Portocarrero of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, said figures announced by Sandinista leaders were unreliable. He said that Sandinista casualties were three times higher than announced today and that rebel losses were only a third as great as Mr. Ortega reported.\n''We will show in early 1987 that the Sandinistas are vulnerable,'' Mr. Calero said. ''We will bring the war closer to population centers. We will widen and multiply our fronts throughout the country, with the aid that we are getting and more than we will get.'\n''In 1987 we expect the downfall of a regime that is corrupt and that is being eaten up from within,'' he said.\nIn an interview 12 months ago, he predicted that 1986 would be ''the year of liberation for Nicaragua.'' Economy Said to Slow Decline\nPresident Ortega said today that Nicaragua's economy had reduced its rate of decline but had not begun to grow.\nRecalling that the economy shrunk by 5 percent in 1985, he said: ''For 1986, we had we had proposed to grow 6.5 percent. This was not possible.''\nThe economy came close to zero growth this year, however, and Mr. Ortega said planners hoped for a 2.1 percent growth rate in 1987.\n''Nineteen-eighty-six was a year of great sacrifices, adding to the toll of pain and blood for the people of Nicaragua,'' he said. ''The year 1987 will be one of great challenges and sacrifices.''\nMr. Ortega, who is about to complete his second year in office, expressed support for what he described as popular movements in South Africa, Chile, El Salvador and Haiti. He said his Government was committed to democracy, but he warned that Nicaraguans who clamor for more political freedom should prove their good faith by ''first defending sovereignty, self-determination, the country's dignity.''\n''In 1986 the Congress of the United States approved the sending of military advisers, ammunition and transport, and $100 milion to continue terrorist actions in Nicaragua,'' he said. ''We must remain prepared to confront aggression.'' Honduran Fighting Cited\nMr. Ortega referred to military campaigns that Nicaraguan troops conducted against contra bases near the border with Honduras in March and again in November and December. As has been his custom, he did not specify whether the fighting had been in Nicaragua or Honduras, but he charged that contras maintained bases in Honduras and were ''trying to invade our territory from Honduran territory.''\nHonduran leaders asserted this month that Sandinista troops searching for contras had crossed into Honduras. They sent planes to bomb two targets inside Nicaragua in retaliation.\nDiplomats and military officers in Managua said they expected contra activity to increase over the coming months as weapons bought with American aid money began reaching rebel soldiers.\nThe Government reported two fatal incidents over the weekend. Six people including two children were said to have died when contras attacked a farm cooperative near the ranching town of Amoapa in the central part of the country. In the border province of Jinotega, two men on a military truck carrying supplies to coffee pickers were killed and five others wounded when a mine exploded beneath them.\nMr. Ortega said today that there had been 35,000 victims since the Nicaraguan war began five years go. That figure was understood to include all military and civilian dead, wounded and missing.

The cue bid of four diamonds was a strong raise to four spades, and South rejected the slam invitation.\nWest took two diamond winners and shifted to a trump. South took dummy's three winners, leaving the jack at large. He then led four rounds of clubs, and East refused to ruff. The position was now this:\nThe routine play of taking a heart finesse would have failed. But Parker saw a way to give himself an extra chance. East had played high-low in diamonds, indicating a doubleton, so the distribution was clear: East had to have three hearts together with the spade jack.\nEast was therefore given the lead with a trump and was forced to lead hearts. This preserved the normal finesse of the jack, but also provided for the actual layout. East led the ten, covered around the table by the jack, queen and king. Then the eight was finessed to make the game. If East had instead led the seven, South would have played the eight.\nYesterday's bridge column erroneously credited a line from ''Promises, Promises'' to Burt Bacharach.

All the Michigan junior tailback needs is one victory for himself Thursday in the Rose Bowl and three victories by the Giants.\nJamie Morris has a chance to become the first known major college football player to walk around wearing the ring of a victorious player in the Super Bowl. All the Michigan junior tailback needs is one victory for himself Thursday in the Rose Bowl and three victories by the Giants.\nMorris, the slick little running back, is the youngest of the three brothers of the Giants' slick little running back, Joe Morris. The two have agreed to trade bowl rings if Michigan beats Arizona State Thursday in the oldest bowl game and the Giants get to and win the Super Bowl -which will be played in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 25.\n''We've been talking about it all year,'' said Jamie. ''Joe and I talk once or twice a week. It's about life in general. It's also about football. Once, when we talked before the season, we talked about maybe we could both get to the Rose Bowl this year. And I said then we could trade rings.'' Michigan No Surprise\nSuch talk before the season was a longer shot for Joe, who seemed then to have less chance of getting to the Pasadena Super Bowl than Jamie had of making it to the New Year's Day Rose Bowl. Michigan, after all, entered this season favored to win the Big Ten title and get here. The Wolverines and Jamie lived up to expectations.\nThe two excellent running backs are not exactly peas in a pod, but from a distance they appear much the same as they scamper and twist their ways for big gains. They're both 5 feet 7 inches tall and the sons of Earl Morris, another 5-7 running back who played high school football in St. Louis. Jamie and Joe and their two brothers and two sisters grew up in Ayer, Mass. Their father, a former Green Beret master sergeant in Vietnam, is a postmaster in Groton, Mass.\nJamie and Joe differ for two notable reasons. Joe is stockier, weighing about 195 pounds to Jamie's 180. Joe and two other brothers, Mike and Larry, played in the Carrier Dome at Syracuse, where Joe broke the rushing records of Jimmy Brown, Floyd Little, Larry Csonka and Ernie Davis.\nJamie went to Michigan, where he played in Michigan Stadium, an outdoor stadium so big that, he said, ''The first time I went out on that field I wanted to turn around and run off. I never saw so many people in my life.'' Regarded as Too Small\nBo Schembechler, Michigan's coach, is from the old school. Even though he doesn't stand much taller than Jamie Morris, Schembechler said: ''I told Jamie when we recruited him he was too small to be a running back and we wanted him for running back kicks. I did, however, promise him the chance to try to be a running back for us. Good thing I did, isn't it?''\n''My friends thought I'd naturally go to Syracuse, what with three older brothers who were Syracuse football players,'' Jamie said. ''But Joe told me to go where I'd be happy. When I told him I thought I'd be happier at Michigan, he said, 'Go Blue.' ''\nThe kick-return specialist role didn't last long. Jamie became very happy at Michigan in just his third game as a freshman when Schembechler put him in as the starting tailback. Except for times when injuries took their toll, Jamie has started at tailback for the Wolverines since.\nThis season he seemed headed for a big season when a knee injury against Florida State forced him to sit out the Wisconsin game the following week. There appeared to be little chance the tailback would reach his goal of 1,000 yards rushing for the regular season. But in the final game against Ohio State - a game Michigan had to win to get to the Rose Bowl - Morris carried 29 times for 210 yards and a season total of 1,039 yards. Took Time to Heal\n''That pop on the knee in the game against Florida State hassled me a lot,'' Jamie said. ''Even after I came back, the knee bothered me when I tried to cut. I finally felt good in the Purdue game and finally felt I was all the way back against Ohio State.''\nMichigan played only two games on grass in 1986 - at Purdue and at Notre Dame - and won them both. The Rose Bowl has a grass field that Schembechler says ''isn't really very good.''\nMorris isn't worried about slowing down on the grass, but he said, ''You have to learn to keep your feet under you more or else you'll slip. Because we beat Purdue and Notre Dame, I don't think the grass here will bother me.'' ROSE BOWL

Rehnquist supports a proposal to give most Federal judges at least a $50,000-a-year raise, saying the pay increase is needed to draw ''first-rate talent.''\nChief Justice William H. Rehnquist supports a proposal to give most Federal judges at least a $50,000-a-year raise, saying the pay increase is needed to draw ''first-rate talent.''\nIn his first year-end statement on the Federal court system, Chief Justice Rehnquist called on President Reagan and Congress today ''to make realistic salary adjustments for judges.''\nThe annual pay that takes effect Thursday is $81,100 a year for Federal trial judges, $85,700 for appellate judges and $107,200 for Associate Justices of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice's annual salary is $111,700.\nA Federal advisory commission recently urged higher salaries for all top Federal officials. Among the commission's proposals were annual salaries of $130,000 for trial judges, $135,000 for appellate judges, $165,000 for Associate Justices and $175,000 for the Chief Justice.\nChief Justice Rehnquist noted that some people felt the commission's recommendations were excessive because Federal judges already earn far more than most Americans. Other Lawyers' Income\n''If Federal judges were drawn from a cross-section of occupations this would be a valid criticism,'' he said. ''The relevant comparison is not with salaries and wages throughout the economy but with the income of other lawyers.\n''In 1985, the median income of a 50-year-old partner in a law firm was $164,000. We must be able to attract this kind of person, among others, to the Federal judiciary if we are to maintain its tradition of excellence.''\n''We will always have men and women available to fill vacancies in the Federal judiciary,'' he said, ''but if salaries are not made comparable to the average in private practice, fewer of these candidates will possess the first-rate talent which has always been a hallmark of the Federal bench.''\nChief Justice Rehnquist, a member of the Supreme Court since 1972, was promoted to Chief Justice this year to replace Warren E. Burger. In his year-end statement, he praised his predecessor's efforts to improve the administration of justice. ''He forced us to realize that the Congress, the executive and the judiciary cannot move in splendid isolation from one another, any more than can the Federal and state courts,'' Chief Justice Rehnquist said.

In leaving the Giants for the University of Alabama as Bear Bryant's successor four years ago, and in leaving Tuscaloosa now, he has burned two bridges in his search for the ideal job.\n''I've never been satisfied in my life,'' he once said, ''and I hope I never am.''\nBut for the moment, Perkins surely is satisfied with the quarterback whom the Bucs surely will take with the first choice in the National Football League draft - Vinny Testaverde, the Heisman Trophy winner. But would Perkins have taken the Bucs' job if they weren't assured of selecting the University of Miami passer? Two, that the Rose, the Orange, the Sugar and the Cotton Bowls form the opening round of an eight-team college football playoff format toward a national championship. The four winning teams would advance to the semifinals that would determine the two teams for the title game.\nOf all the bowl games this time, only tomorrow night's Sunkist Fiesta Bowl between Miami and Penn State will be accepted as having defined the nation's best team.\nAs a result, the four traditional bowls have dissolved this time into exhibitions for television programming and excuses for a vacation for students, alumni and boosters. If the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl scenario for No. 1 develops again next year, the four traditional bowls will be forced to rethink their positions on a national championship playoff.\nUp to now, the traditional bowls have resisted proposals that they form the opening round of a playoff. Each bowl always hopes to put together what the Tempe, Ariz., promoters did - the No. 1 and No. 2-ranked teams.\nIf the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl turns out to be a onetime happening in college football's annual search for No. 1, the traditional bowls won't surrender their alliances with the major conference champions.\nBut if the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl attracts another showdown for No. 1 next year between two independents, the traditional bowls might realize that four first-round playoff games are more meaningful than four empty exhibitions. More meaningful games also will attract more meaningful television dollars, as Miami and Penn State learned.\nMiami and Penn State each will take home $2.4 million, more than each of the Super Bowl XXI teams, not counting the pro players' shares.\nAt the Super Bowl, each of the winning players will collect $36,000 from the National Football League office, each of the losing players $18,000 - a total of at least $1.8 million and $900,000 for the players on the winning and losing teams, based on 50 shares per team.\nThe winning Super Bowl franchise itself will receive $1.32 million and the losing franchise $960,000 to cover the shares for coaches and front-office personnel as well as expenses, aside from air fare.\nWith this year's game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., each team will receive the value of 100 first-class round-trip tickets between Los Angeles and its home-area airport. The clubs apply that air fare money toward chartered jets. Three, that the N.F.L. acknowledge at least partial responsibility for the use of steroids among college football players.\nYear after year, the N.F.L. has talked about how its athletes are ''bigger, stronger and faster,'' but some of those bigger, stronger and faster athletes didn't get that way just by lifting weights. Perhaps in the hope of adding strength and bulk in order to attract N.F.L. scouts, some college players have used steroids, as the National Collegiate Athletic Association tests have shown. And who knows how many other players have used steroids?\nAccording to Commissioner Pete Rozelle, when the N.F.L. begins testing for steroids at its training camps this summer, it will rely on education and rehabilitation for those who test positive. But what happens to a repeat offender? Four, that Don King, the boxing promoter, be prohibited from promoting a fight involving any boxer managed by his son, Carl.\nThe New York State Athletic Commission is now under investigation by the state's Inspector General's Office over allegations that Carl King managed both James (Bonecrusher) Smith and Tim Witherspoon in their recent World Boxing Association heavyweight title bout at Madison Square Garden.\nBut the answer is not merely to determine if Carl King managed both fighters. The answer is to prevent relatives of any promoter from managing any fighters on that promoter's cards.\n''When you're a manager, you do what's best for your fighter,'' Witherspoon's trainer, Slim Jim Robinson, said after his Witherspoon was dethroned in a first-round knockout. ''Not what's best for the promoter.''\n''When we talked with Don King before the fight,'' Witherspoon said of a meeting with the promoter, ''Carl sat on Smith's side of the table. Carl was not there on behalf of me, but on behalf of his own blood.''\nBut a blood-relative rule in New York boxing wouldn't prevent Carl King from managing fighters on Don King's cards elsewhere unless other major boxing states, especially Nevada and New Jersey, adopted a similar rule.\nIf boxing is ever abolished, it will be for what happens outside the ring, not in it.\nSPORTS OF THE TIMES
95	REPORT ANALYZES INCREASED COSTS OF TELEPHONE BILLS	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DE1E3CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THE average consumer's telephone bill has risen by nearly 20 percent in the three years since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, according to a report made public by the Consumer Federation of America.\nTHE average consumer's telephone bill has risen by nearly 20 percent in the three years since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, according to a report made public by the Consumer Federation of America.\nEven after allowing for substantial reductions in long-distance telephone rates, the report says, the increased cost of local service has accounted for ''the largest sustained real increase in residential telephone bills since the passage of the Communications Act over half a century ago.''\nWhen the American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced its plan in January 1982 to settle a Federal antitrust suit by divesting itself of local phone companies, the telephone company predicted that local rates would rise by about 8 percent to 10 percent a year and that long-distance rates would rise at a rate slightly slower than inflation. The Consumer Federation report says that local rates have risen by 40 percent, or 10 percent faster than A.T.&T. predicted, since the breakup in 1983.\nConsumer groups say they believe customers are beginning to feel that deregulation so far has benefited only the local telephone companies by allowing them to diversify their business and in that way increase their revenues.\nThis year, for the first time, consumers in three states - Arizona, Oregon and Maine - were asked to vote on bills that would have further deregulated local telephone rates, but in each state they voted against further change.\nAt a time when state utility regulators are predicting an era of lower utility rates because of dropping interest rates and the new tax code, consumer groups say it is time for those regulators to begin asking telephone companies to pass on to consumers some of the profits they have received through deregulation.\nThe Consumer Federation report is based on an analysis of telephone costs compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index.\nThe Consumer Federation, a nonprofit organization that represents more than 200 state and local consumer groups, said in its report: ''We were told that widespread, cutthroat competition would drive down telephone prices and bring information-age gadgets and services to all consumers. Instead, consumers must pay significantly more to get the same old service they had prior to the breakup.''\nThe report says the Consumer Price Index shows that the amount consumers pay in local telephone costs rose by 39.8 percent from January 1984 to October 1986. Long-distance tolls on calls made within states increased by 4 percent, while long-distance rates for calls that cross state lines have dropped by 17 percent in that time.\nIn a survey of basic monthly costs, excluding the amount of money paid for calls but including fixed fees for access to long-distance service, installation and wiring costs, local phone charges have risen to about $15.40 a month this year from $10.55 a month in 1983.\nAnother study, the preliminary results of a survey scheduled to come out later this month, indicates that 20 percent to 25 percent of households with annual incomes of less than $15,000 do not have phones. About half of those families used to have phones, according to the report by the United States Public Interest Research Group, an association of state public interest research groups originally formed by Ralph Nader. Pamela Gilbert, the association's staff attorney, said more than half of those now without phones say they cannot afford them. The study was based on a door-to-door survey of about a thousand households in 10 states with annual incomes below $15,000.\nThe percentage of American households with telephones grew from 78 percent in 1960 to 93 percent in 1980, but has hovered around 91 to 93 percent for the past six years. Ms. Gilbert said the cost of telephone service was decreasing in the 1960's and 1970's, but that since 1980 the true cost, including inflation, has risen.\nThe Consumer Federation report compares the earnings of the Bell operating companies with those of other corporations in Business Week magazine's list of the top 1,000 American companies, ranked according to market value. It says that in a period when regulators granted $5.5 billion in phone rate increases, the phone companies earned more money than comparable private corporations.\nIn 1984 the phone companies earned the same return on equity, about 13.2 percent, that others in the top 1,000 earned. In 1985, however, their average return was 13.7 percent, while the average for all the companies in the top 1,000 was 11.4 percent, and in 1986 they earned 14 percent as against the average of 10.9 percent for the top 1,000 companies. The phone companies also showed better earnings than other utility companies, the report said.\nIf the Bell operating companies had earned rates of return similar to those of the top 1,000 companies or other utilities, the Consumer Federation said, the cost to consumers would have been $1.25 billion to $2 billion less. And if those rates of return had also reflected the benefits the phone companies received from lower interest on their capital costs and depreciation expenses, their rates would have been another $1 billion less, the report said.\nThomas J. Novick, executive director of the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group, said of the recent vote in that state on further phone deregulation, ''We think in large part the vote reflected a distrust of the phone company.''\nIn Oregon and Maine, the voters were considering whether to allow their regional telephone companies to charge all customers for local calls as they now charge for long-distance calls, based on the number and lengths of calls, and the time of day and distance.\nThe Oregon vote was on whether to ban the phone company from establishing such a mandatory system of local metered service. About 80 percent voted in favor of the ban. Thus the company can offer local metered service for customers who want it, but must continue to offer local service at a flat rate, as phone companies have traditionally done.\nIn Maine, the state utilities commission had approved mandatory local metered service. After 50,000 voters signed a referendum petition, the measure was revised to require the phone company to also offer a flat rate, which consumer groups said was higher than the metered rates approved by the commission.\nThe measure eventually put on the ballot prohibited mandatory local metered service and required a ''low-cost flat rate.'' Although the local phone company spent more than $1.6 million to defeat the proposal, it passed.\n''I think these votes show that people want traditional service at low cost,'' said Craig McDonald, the field director for Public Citizen, a consumer group based in Washington. ''They don't want to be subsidizing the other new ventures of the phone company.''\nArizona voters considered a bill that would have transferred regulation of phone rates to the Legislature and would simultaneously have deregulated most of the company's new ventures - primarily data transmission.\nArizona voters rejected the measure, according to Susan Williams, director of the state's Residential Utility Consumer Office, because ''the telephone customer, while perhaps puzzled by the names used, has not been fooled by the general direction, which is to sock it to the small business users or the small residential users.''

He's even dismissed from his job as a janitor because, says his boss, he's overqualified and lacks the love required for cleaning offices and lavatories.\nAccording to ''Wisdom,'' which opened yesterday at the Baronet and other theaters, society has left open only one route to the young man -crime, but what sort of crime? In what should be a funny sequence (but isn't), he considers, in turn, kidnapping, arson and murder, none of which really interest him. Like so many of his contemporaries, including beauty-contest winners, Wisdom is most interested in that vaguely generalized group termed people.\nSuddenly he has it. He'll hold up banks and, instead of taking money, he'll destroy mortgage records, thus freeing all those little guys on whom the lending institutions are foreclosing in the economic squeeze of the mid-80's.\nMost of ''Wisdom'' is played as cut-rate, populist comedy - Wisdom and his girlfriend, Karen (Demi Moore), being hailed by the public for their unorthodox, philanthropic exploits in robbing banks throughout the Southwest. Soon, however, things go wrong for the do-gooders, possibly because no one could think of a lighthearted way to get them out of their mess.\nMr. Estevez is far more at ease as an actor than as a writer or director, though he's certainly as competent as most people making television movies. The problem is that ''Wisdom'' is aggressively boring, either because one can predict everything that's going to happen and exactly how it will look on the screen or because the concept of the film eventually seems even more confused than the title character.\nAfter devoting the second half of the movie to pretty images of himself and Miss Moore on their socially conscious joyride, Mr. Estevez, as Wisdom, is heard on the soundtrack saying something to the effect that the public was wrong to see the pair as romantic heroes. Under the circumstances, that thought comes a bit late.\nThe performances aren't especially good or bad. Mr. Estevez and Miss Moore are photogenic, and Tom Skerritt and Veronica Cartwright, as Wisdom's worried, well-meaning parents, are no less bland than their roles.\nThe R-rated movie is titled ''Wisdom,'' but by the end it's become ''Bonnie and Clunk.'' THE CAST - WISDOM, written and directed by Emilio\nEstevez; director of photography, Adam Greenberg; film editor, Michael Kahn; music by Danny Elfman; produced by Bernard Williams; released by the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation. At Ziegfeld, Avenue of the Americas and 54th Street; Baronet, 59th Street at Third Avenue; 23d Street West Triplex, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Running time: 108 minutes. This film is rated R.

One also was treated for a sprained ankle.\nAmong the injured were two girls, 10 and 11 years of age, who were staying with their sister at the co-ed fraternity, according to a Columbia spokesman, Henry Fuhrman.\nThe fire broke out in the basement of the four-story brownstone at 534 West 114th Street at 1:07 A.M. Although the cause remains under investigation, a department spokesman said it appeared the blaze began with an electrical short circuit in the basement and spread upward into the building.\nMETRO DATELINES

According to human rights officials, about 3,500 Chileans are barred from entering the country.\nGeneral Pinochet said that over the next 90 days the Government would reduce the list until only those who were considered a ''serious risk'' to the country would be included.\nThe state of siege was declared after left-wing guerrillas ambushed the presidential motorcade outside Santiago, killing five of General Pinochet's bodyguards.\nDespite the lifting of the state of siege, the military Government will still hold wide powers to arrest and to restrict freedom of information, movement and assembly under a state of emergency that has been in force, apart from a brief period in 1983, since the 1973 military coup.

105	BELGIAN DANCERS PROTEST DISMISSAL OF VALERY PANOV	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D71E3CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Thirty-three members of the Royal Ballet of Flanders are holding a sit-in at the Antwerp headquarters of the Belgian state dance company in a protest against the recent dismissal of Valery Panov, its artistic director.\nThirty-three members of the Royal Ballet of Flanders are holding a sit-in at the Antwerp headquarters of the Belgian state dance company in a protest against the recent dismissal of Valery Panov, its artistic director.\nThe sit-in began last Friday, forcing the closing of the building and the cancellation of three performances. The dancers say they expect to remain in the building, which houses dance studios and administrative offices, at least through Monday. ''We are planning to stay here until Panov is taken back,'' Nancy Glynn, a dancer with the 62-member company and a leader of the protesters, said yesterday.\nMr. Panov, a former Kirov Ballet dancer, became internationally known when his fight to emigrate from the Soviet Union drew support from dance celebrities around the world. He and his wife, the dancer Galina Panov, emigrated in 1974.\nMr. Panov was named director of the Royal Ballet of Flanders in August 1984. His contract was to have run for five years. On Dec. 1, he was informed by letter that his contract would be terminated on June 30, at the end of the season. Last Friday, the dancers say, they were informed by the company that Mr. Panov had been dismissed.\nMarcel Van Der Bruggen, chairman of the board of directors, said Mr. Panov was dismissed because of his administrative record. ''He didn't make a budget,'' Mr. Van Der Bruggen said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''He didn't organize the company as it was organized before. There was no inner discipline in the lessons and rehearsals. Some principal dancers danced too much outside our company.'' Trouble Over Promotions\nMr. Van Der Bruggen said that Mr. Panov had also failed to follow the prescribed system of promotion within the company. ''His answer was 'I am only a creator,' '' the board chairman said. ''But then he is not an artistic director.'' He added that the board had asked Mr. Panov to reform his administrative methods. ''But he was not working to change - only to make opposition and agitation,'' Mr. Van Der Bruggen said. The board notified Mr. Panov that he would be paid through June.\n''I had one of the biggest administrative machines in this place, so I never worried about talking about money,'' Mr. Panov said by telephone from Belgium yesterday. He added that he felt the board had been less than candid with him, and that the matter was ''a personal fight'' with Mr. Van Der Bruggen. Mr. Panov said he had asked the Belgian Minister of Culture to make Mr. Van Der Bruggen the head of a separate company that performs in musicals.\n''That was a month ago,'' Mr. Panov said. ''He moved me. He wants to keep the power, but I will stay with the company until the end.'' He said he planned to spend New Year's Eve with the striking dancers. Friends have been taking food to the protesters, and a teacher has been helping to give them daily classes. But no one, it seemed, could figure out how to operate the company switchboard. 'He Changed This Company'\nThe dancers do not dispute that Mr. Panov had ''a lack of organization,'' as Ben Van Cauwenburgh, a leading member of the company, put it. ''But he changed this company completely,'' Mr. Van Cauwenburgh said. ''He was a turning point. And they can't see his success.'' A dancers' committee met with members of the board of directors on Tuesday. The board refused to reinstate Mr. Panov but offered to let him continue as resident choreographer.\nMs. Glynn said the dancers had met twice since Dec. 1, with 80 percent voting to support Mr. Panov at each meeting. The dancers have also conducted letter-writing campaigns, audience appeals and a press conference. ''We are now trying to meet with the Minister of Culture,'' Mr. Van Cauwenburgh said. ''But it is very difficult to talk with him. He is busy.''\n''If George Balanchine had not been supported by Lincoln Kirstein,'' Mr. Panov said, ''he would never have come in. I am very upset that behind my shoulder there is no person like Mr. Kirstein.''

The numbers of troops could increase when the exercises move into a new phase in March, but a Pentagon spokesman said details would not be disclosed until a later date.\nIn addition to the maneuvers announced Monday, hundreds of United States Army Reserve and National Guard troops are rotating in and out of Honduras in a separate road-building exercise known as Blazing Trails, which will bring thousands of reservists to Honduras for brief stays over the next four months. Time of High Tension\nWhile the two exercises do not represent a change of course for American military policy toward Honduras, they come at a time of high tension in the region and are important for several military reasons.\nSome of the facilities that are being improved are close to the Nicaraguan border. One of them, at Jamastran, is near the scene of recent fighting between Nicaraguan forces and contras, or rebels, who oppose the Nicaraguan Government. It was used by American helicopters to transport Honduran troops who fought off a Nicaraguan attack on the contras early this month.\nIn addition, the future exercises that will use the newly enhanced facilities will more closely link American and Honduran forces and will improve American abilities to control and resupply military maneuvers in places like Honduras, officials said.\nPentagon officials said that the exercises announced Monday involve 700 members of two engineering battalions stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C., along with 250 supporting troops from the same American base. The remainder of the 1,100 troops sent to Honduras for the exercise are involved in headquarters work or civil affairs, said Lieut. Col. Keith Schneider, a military spokesman. Can't Explain Report\nHe said he was unable to explain a report by The Associated Press from Tegucigalpa, which stated that the Honduran military had put the number of Americans in the exercise at 3,000. He also noted that of the 4,500 National Guard and Reserve troops who will spend time in Honduras over the next few months for Blazing Trails, no more than 600 would be there at any one time.

That makes this, among other things, Happy New Tax Year.\nThe Earth, Moon and Sun are in rare alignment this week, and so is the Internal Revenue Code. Because of the first three, tides are exceptionally high. Tax rates, meanwhile, are plunging. Tax reform struck at midnight. That makes this, among other things, Happy New Tax Year.\nNew Year's Day needs no special promotion. It is already the world's most widely celebrated holiday. It's a day off everywhere from Albania to Zimbabwe, in all but 15 of the 182 countries, principalities and territories that the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company logs in its annual calendar of momentous occasions.\nIt has not always been thus. In earlier times, the year dawned with the vernal equinox in March. In Afghanistan, it still does. But even in China and Israel, whose people celebrate their own new year with great ceremony, today is a ''New Year's Day'' holiday. Sri Lanka has another twist; it celebrates the new year today and Full Moon Day every month. But holiday-crazed Americans take the prize for celebrating almost everything else.\nLast year, Congress entertained 305 bills to designate a day, a week, a month or a whole year -and enacted 94. Accordingly, this is the Year of the Reader, the Year of the Americas and the Year of Thanksgiving. In addition, for Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, it's the bicentennial of statehood. For Philadelphia, it is a yearlong ''We the People 200'' celebration, commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Constitution.\nThat will be an occasion for all America to celebrate a precious legacy from the past. The tax law provides an occasion to celebrate a sensible present legacy to the future. Anyone who lusted after lucrative real estate loopholes had his last chance yesterday. Tycoons who dreamed of capturing General Motors in a tax-friendly takeover are one day too late.\nFor John and Jane Doe, however, it's a day to hail. Public Law 99-514 introduces lower tax rates for almost everyone, fewer exceptions for the favored few and, fairest of all, total tax relief for six million or more people at the bottom of the ladder. One new law will not a happy new year make. It is, however, a very cheerful start.
109	You Can Call the 1980's 'The Ugly Decade'	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDC1F3CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Historians and the media are pleased when they can nail down the significance of a period with evocative labels - the Age of the Robber Barons, for example, or the Roaring 20's - for they remind one of salient characteristics.\nHistorians and the media are pleased when they can nail down the significance of a period with evocative labels - the Age of the Robber Barons, for example, or the Roaring 20's - for they remind one of salient characteristics.\nIt begins to look as if the 1980's will have to be remembered as the The Ugly Decade, because so many distasteful things have surfaced in the first six years and may continue into the last four. We have witnessed a kind of general know-nothingness in which evading critical problems is a substitute for grappling with them, in which damage-controlling an error is better than avoiding it, in which sitting tall in the saddle is preferred to riding forward, and in which, amid the verbiage, certain essential freedoms and equalities of our national life are diminished and eroded.\nNotoriously, President Reagan's two Administrations have produced a massive deficit that, if allowed to grow untended for two more years, would modify our national structure. I have watched three other nations, Germany, Japan and Brazil, incur so much debt that their only solution has been to debase their currency, wipe out the debt and damage grievously the middle class. The very rich and the very poor are not seriously hurt, since the rich can afford to lose and the poor have nothing to lose. But the middle is crushed and sometimes never recovers.\nMeanwhile, the fortunes of the poor, the minorities and students have suffered reverses so grievous that the United States is in danger of losing its reputation as a haven. It is becoming a society in which advantage is to the rich, disadvantage to the poor. Night after night, I hear Administration spokesmen reason that, since the Dow Jones average has risen another 10 points, all is well with the Republic, ignoring the fact that oilmen in Louisiana are wallowing in bankruptcy and farmers in Iowa are losing their farms. And as I listen I recall Oliver Goldsmith's reflection on his deserted village:\n''Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey, Where wealth accumulates, and men decay.''\nDuring this decade, the accumulation of wealth has been deified. Magazines keep score and glorify the latest adventurer to amass half a billion of other people's money. The 26-year-old lawyer who hauls down his first several million is applauded just before the tardy Feds toss him in the slammer for ignoring moral laws the average high school freshman would have honored.\nIvan F. Boesky becomes the prototypical financier of this decade, and the takeover artist who can orchestrate a greenmail coup has become a more lauded hero than the manager of a corporation that is hiring people and making a usable product. The manipulation of money markets is seen as a more important function than the making of things. Thriving businesses find themselves forced to assume vast debt merely to protect themselves instead of improving their productive capabilities.\nThe ugliness of the decade crops up everywhere. The former Secretary of the Interior, James Watt, denigrated our national heritage of parks and open lands. Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d strives to rewrite our constitutional pattern, while ultraconservative religious forces are encouraged to run wild. Our public school system, one of the reasons why we became a superior society, is threatened, and under the banner of protecting home and family, government invades the bedroom and legislates through the courts an accepted code for sexual behavior.\nOne must grant that some of the ugliness has stemmed from phenomena that no Administration could have controlled. Bad weather has hurt farmers. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries collapses and devastates the economies of Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and Alaska. The specter of AIDS stalks the land, and terrorism disorganizes world governments. Economies in Latin America collapse and threaten our internal banking system. This has not been a lucky decade.\nAt this unpropitious moment, the Adminstration shoots itself in the foot with its handling of the Iranian hostage crisis, selling arms to a proclaimed enemy and illegally funneling the profits into the murky situation in Central America. Our foreign policy, which other nations properly inspect with magnifying glasses, seems to have been placed in the hands of a Marine lieutenant colonel free-wheeling about the world. There has been disillusionment at home and scorn abroad. For the first time that I can recall in my work abroad, other nations are laughing at us, especially since we spent the last several years lecturing them sanctimoniously to avoid the very errors we were secretly committing.\nYet despite the gloom, I believe this decade can be rescued. I pray that no smoking gun will be found in the President's hand; if none is discovered, he has a fighting chance to remedy the present disarray.\nI hope things can be repaired for the following reason: Since 1960, we have not treated Presidents well. John F. Kennedy was murdered, Gerald R. Ford shot at twice, Lyndon B. Johnson run out of office. Richard M. Nixon resigned, and if Ronald Reagan is emasculated America will appear to the rest of the world as just one more banana republic, unable to achieve or sustain stability. Mr. Reagan's unmatched popularity, at home if not abroad, is an asset that must not be casually wasted.\nWhat can be done to save the reputation of this decade?\nFirst, the President can stand before the American people and use his unquestioned powers of communication to say: 'I allowed an error to occur. I have corrected it. And I won't let it happen again, for I obey the laws and traditions of this nation.''\nSecond, he must return foreign policy to the control of those best qualified to conduct it. Cowboys in the White House cellar must be reined in.\nThird, he should disband his damage-control squad. If error is promptly admitted and rectified, no cleanup squad is needed.\nFourth, he must knock off the windy macho verbalisms. We face serious problems, and if in his next State of the Union Message he claims we are still standing tall or that we are once again respected throughout the world because of our victory in Grenada, Congress is going to wince and listeners abroad guffaw. Further ridicule is something we cannot afford.\nFifth, he must let it be seen in all he does and says that he is a humane man who cares as much for the poor and the middle class as he does for the rich, who up to now have been the principal beneficiaries of his policies. The necessary corrections can be made without violation of Republican policies, for I am much encouraged by the recent behavior of Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, who seems to have altered course in midstream, talking sense where he once ranted reaction. If he can make the switch, so can the other members of the Administration.\nSixth, the President right now ought to wrestle honestly with our deficit and not rely on spurious legerdemain like the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-reduction law. Our Government should raise taxes immediately and cut expenditures dramatically. But since Republicans refuse to do the former and Democrats are unable to do the latter, I suppose we will stagger along toward a major devaluation. I doubt there is much Mr. Reagan can do to break this deadly impasse, given his strong aversion to taxing the well-to-do, but I hope he does not worsen the situation.\nSeventh, everything the Republican leadership does in the next two years, and all the behavior of the Democratic Congress, ought to point toward a smooth, responsibile transition to the next Administration. Last October, it looked as if that Administration would be Republican, but the debacles engineered by that party make its victory less automatic. Any observer who can predict the tickets of the two major parties in 1988 would be a master seer. I don't even have an opinion, let alone a prediction.\nThe Ugly Decade is drawing to a close. I hope it doesn't get worse. I hope President Reagan can regroup his forces and end his spectacular incumbency in orderly fashion. But he can achieve this only if adventurism ends, only if sensible controls are established and only if the American people are addressed in words of common sense rather than in soothing verbiage.

The Shas Party is predominantly made up of Orthodox Sephardic Jews.\n''The High Court of Justice demanded that I list a non-Jew as a Jew,'' Rabbi Peretz told the Israeli radio. ''As a Jew and a rabbi loyal to the tradition and Bible of Israel, I have declared and declare again that my hand will never ever sign for a fraudulent conversion that was not conducted according to the Halakha.''\nHalakha is the code of Jewish law. The American immigrant, Shoshana Miller, was converted by a Reform rabbi in Colorado Springs before she came to live in Israel.\nWhen Ms. Miller immigrated and applied for identity papers, Rabbi Peretz agreed to list her as Jewish, but added alongside her religion the word ''converted.'' The Israeli Supreme Court ruled Dec. 2 that the additional word was illegal and that Rabbi Peretz must relist Ms. Miller merely as a Jew.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said authorities did not revoke investigative custody for the remaining two.\nFounded in 1971, the Jazz Section's nationwide membership of about 7,000 advocates freedom in the arts and opposes controls exerted by the Communist authorities.
112	HUNTERS ADVISED ON SHIFT TO STEEL SHELLS	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DA1F3CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A recent newsletter of Long Island's South Shore Waterfowlers Association contains some sound advice for those who are still resisting the use of nontoxic steel shot for duck and goose hunting.\nA recent newsletter of Long Island's South Shore Waterfowlers Association contains some sound advice for those who are still resisting the use of nontoxic steel shot for duck and goose hunting.\nLong Island gunners in particular should realize, writes Steve Sanford, a waterfowl biologist with the State Department of Environmental Conservation, that the new steel loads will be required throughout the region in the 1987-1988 season. He advises Long Islanders to purchase no more lead-loaded shells than will be needed for this season's hunting.\nOne might go a step further and suggest that, even if one hunts in an area where it isn't legally required, one should purchase a few boxes of steel-loaded shells and begin to test their efficacy.\nGreat numbers of waterfowl die each year after eating spent lead pellets and, after decades of research, steel shot has emerged as the best nontoxic substitute. After more than 10 years of often bitter debate involving hunters, conservation organizations and state and Federal wildlife agencies, the Department of the Interior, prodded by court action initiated by the National Wildlife Federation, announced this year a program to phase out lead shot for waterfowling throughout the nation by 1991.\nThe plan calls for first making steel shot mandatory in counties in which the annual duck harvest has been more than 20 birds per square mile. In New York State this year, this will involve Suffolk, Nassau, Jefferson, Wayne and Genesee counties. Hunter resistance to steel shot focuses on two things: The lighter steel pellets do not retain their velocity as well as lead pellets of the same diameter and therefore have less penetration at longer ranges, and steel shot can damage the barrels of fine old double guns. On the other hand, steel loads tend to produce more uniform patterns because the harder pellets are more uniform in size and shape than those of lead and also highly resistant to deformation when traveling down a gun barrel.\nAs one who has used steel shot on both ducks and Canada geese for the last few years, I have seen no difference in practical results when shooting at ranges out to 40 or 45 yards. If you are ''on'' the birds at those distances, they will be cleanly killed with the steel-loaded shells.\nAnother objection to steel loads is that they are more expensive, about 25 percent, than their lead counterparts, and this situation isn't likely to change very much. Over the years, many hunters have saved money by loading their own shotshells.\nThere are a few companies offering reloading components for steel shot, an endeavor that calls for more care and precision than does reloading with lead shot. If one goes waterfowling fewer than a dozen times a year, the savings realized aren't worth the trouble. One should take care to prevent steel-loaded shells from getting wet. The pellets will rust, and an extreme result of this could be a charge fused into a near-solid mass. Factory-loaded shells with their new plastic hulls are highly resistant to rain or even being dropped into a pool of water in boat or blind. Lead pellets cannot rust, of course.\nI write of water-soaked shells from experience. Many years ago when I was in graduate school and as poor as a churchmouse, I often couldn't afford a box of shells with which to go forth and augment the family larder. I was given some shells that the members of a posh gunning club had decided were too old and had heaved by the case into the salt pond that fronted their holdings.\nA week or two after those shells went overboard, a friend dredged many of them up while oystering and gave half to me.\nIn those days, the shell hulls, or cases, were made of paper that was waterproofed with wax. I arranged those shells, row on row, on newspapers under the black iron kitchen stove, gave them about a month to dry out and began to use them. They were swollen by the immersion, but I got around that by peeling off layer after layer of paper until they would fit in my old double gun.\nHunting with them was an unnerving experience. Some performed as a new shell should, but about one in four failed to fire or produced a minuscule explosion that barely drove the pellets from the barrel.

113	SPRINGSTEEN ALBUM: A SURE THING	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D91F3CF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The end of 1986 was the time of the monolith: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's ''Live/1975-85.'' Selling as fast as it could be trucked into record stores, blanketing FM airwaves, the five-LP/three-CD set made its debut in Billboard's No. 1 position and has stayed there through December. It's a fine album - but its status as the year's major rock event isn't a good sign.\nThe end of 1986 was the time of the monolith: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's ''Live/1975-85.'' Selling as fast as it could be trucked into record stores, blanketing FM airwaves, the five-LP/three-CD set made its debut in Billboard's No. 1 position and has stayed there through December. It's a fine album - but its status as the year's major rock event isn't a good sign.\n''Live/1975-85'' is a long-awaited document of rock's most highly praised live performances, but it carries its monumentality lightly. As the album follows Mr. Springsteen's progress from clubs to stadiums, from ''king of the alley'' to high-flown rock poet to self-conscious working-class bard, it shows he hasn't forgotten how to hang loose. Just when the outlook for Mr. Springsteen's characters seems irredeemably bleak and the music starts to trudge, the next song rocks out.\nWhile ''Live/1975-85'' is a triumph for Mr. Springsteen (and one more vindication of the college radio stations, critics and fans who latched on to him in 1972 and never let go), the album's riotous reception doesn't simply reflect its high quality. ''Live/ 1975-85'' is also a consumer product involving no little calculation, including its Christmas-season release date. ''Live/1975-85'' isn't just the year's Big Thing; it's also a sure thing.\nIt's a sure thing for radio exposure on FM rock stations that are playing older, proven, guitar-centered, midtempo rock up to 80 percent of the time, in a format misnamed ''classic rock.'' It's a sure thing to receive intense promotion from Columbia Records and from record stores, which count on a giant Christmas seller to bring in customers. And it's a sure thing for Mr. Springsteen, who unveils only one song newer than his 1984 album ''Born in the U.S.A.''\nA live album is a standard holding action for both superstars and would-be stars; it's a chance to revive older songs, rev up recent ones and add a few favorite covers of other songwriters. It's worth remembering that in 1975-76, the British rocker Peter Frampton's ''Frampton Comes Alive'' became, briefly, the all-time best-selling album. It, too, fit FM-rock formats perfectly.\nAt this point in his career, it may be Mr. Springsteen's role to make honorable use of pop-business as usual. He made his live album a generous one - comparatively low-priced (discounted to $30 or under, it costs considerably less than what the traffic would bear), well-packaged and stocked with Springsteen songs that hadn't appeared on albums. And knowing the kind of wide media exposure it would inevitably get, Mr. Springsteen made the first single and video clip - the cover of Edwin Starr's Motown hit ''War'' - carry an explicit message.\nThe record business learns from its blockbusters. A few years ago, such multimillion-sellers as Michael Jackson's ''Thriller,'' David Bowie's ''Let's Dance,'' Cyndi Lauper's ''She's So Unusual,'' Prince's ''Purple Rain,'' Tina Turner's ''Private Dancer'' and Mr. Springsteen's ''Born in the U.S.A.'' suggested that there was an audience ready to accept multifarious combinations of rock, pop and funk; while the upshot was a slew of ''multiformat'' albums that tried to please everyone while taking no chances, a few promising hybrids emerged, among them Paul Simon's poly-ethnic pop and the rap-metal of the Beastie Boys. By contrast, ''Live/1975-85'' proves only that sure things are sure things. Solid as the music is, the album is still a retrospective. It only looks back. Music for Young Fogies\n''Live/1975-85'' capped a year in rock that might be characterized as the Revenge of the Baby Boom. Tempos slowed; the Top 40 was riddled with ballads, usually a sign of an older audience, and song lyrics gazed toward the gauzy, halcyon 1960's.\nHuey Lewis and the News supplied a young fogies' manifesto with ''Hip to Be Square.'' Aretha Franklin's ''Jimmy Lee'' linked first love to a Motown beat, while Eddie Money explicitly summoned the early 1960's in ''Take Me Home Tonight'' with the voice of Ronnie Spector, herself, singing ''Be My Baby.'' Blues and 1960's soul, seen from 20 years later as a single style, showed up in the music of Peter Gabriel, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Simply Red and Robert Cray; Prince and the Bangles reveled in psychedelia and 1960's pop, while R.E.M. scored a major hit with a 1960's throwaway, ''Superman.'' John Cougar Mellencamp's ''R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.'' is subtitled ''A Salute to 1960's Rock.''\nAnother 1960's legacy, songs with a political flavor, also re-emerged -not just Bruce Springsteen's ''War,'' but Bruce Hornsby's ''Way It Is'' (about dignity battling unemployment and race discrimination), Genesis' ''Land of Confusion'' (which has nebulous lyrics but has been marketed with a video clip that openly mocks Ronald Reagan) and Timbuk 3's sardonic ''The Future's So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades'' (about ''studying nuclear science'').\nThose shifts in tempo and topic could mean baby-boomers are once again flaunting their numerical strength. Certainly the record business sees it that way; all the major labels activated or reactivated their jazz divisions this year to release music (and sometimes background music) aimed at more mature listeners. The continuing sales explosion of compact disks - a high-priced way of buying music, and the province of well-heeled consumers - also suggests that boomers are business.\nThen again, as songs slow down and arrangements grow plush, rock and pop may just be drifting away from their traditional constituency. Younger whipper-snappers (up into their mid-20s), with the short attention spans and the fondness for noise, can get more and better special effects from television and movies -particularly now, when radio programmers are all but eliminating new bands and new music from their playlists. It will take music that raises hackles and unnerves young fogies, and finds ways for the public to hear it, to revitalize the younger pop audience - and to remind their parents that real 1960's music was anything but bland. Food-Music Connection\nPredicting rock-and-roll's future is a thankless task, but recent years suggest a new kind of correlation: food fads have been leading rock fads by six months to a year. The vogue for blackened redfish and Bayou peppers presaged a flurry of Cajun-tinged rock, from Rockin' Sidney's ''My Toot-Toot'' to Dire Straits' ''Walk of Life.'' A Caribbean craze was reflected in a new lilt for songs by Lionel Richie, the Miami Sound Machine and Steve Winwood. Then there was a rediscovery of all-American food, and a resurgence of hard-rocking, guitar-driven American bands from Bon Jovi to the de-funked Talking Heads.\nIn hindsight, it all sounds simple. But for the would-be oracle, the trick is finding how to apply the food metaphor. At the moment, homey bistros, grazing menus and fish specialists seem to be proliferating in New York. Does this mean we should expect cabaret songs? Short-short rockers? Sea chanteys? In six months, the answer should be obvious.\nCRITIC'S NOTEBOOK

Mikhail Gorbachev now feeds hopes of withdrawal and reconciliation. He even permits open criticism of the war by Andrei Sakharov. Yet there are only token reductions of a Soviet occupation army of 110,000.\nAs the Afghanistan war grinds into its eighth year, the Soviet Union seems of two minds about its bloodiest encounter since World War II. Mikhail Gorbachev now feeds hopes of withdrawal and reconciliation. He even permits open criticism of the war by Andrei Sakharov. Yet there are only token reductions of a Soviet occupation army of 110,000. The investment in roads and bases implies a policy of absorption and annexation.\nThe war's costs in life are bitter, most unforgivably for the Afghan people. Hundreds of thousands are dead; perhaps five million, a third of the population, have fled to Pakistan and Iran. Yet resistance is unabated and so is the world's denunciation of an unwarranted attack on a nonaligned neighbor.\nThe Soviet posture confirms an adage attributed to the Rev. William Inge, once Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral: ''A man may build himself a throne of bayonets, but he cannot sit on it.'' It's not Mr. Gorbachev's throne, not yet. He has made cautious moves toward extrication. He has installed a new leadership in Kabul, and is making overtures to non-Communist Afghan exiles. Soviet television no longer ignores the war, but even reports on casualties. And Soviet diplomats claim agreement on all but one element in a United Nations plan to bring about a Soviet withdrawal in exchange for an end to outside aid to the Afghan insurgents.\nThe remaining snag is ostensibly the timetable. Moscow says it needs years to pull out its troops; Pakistan insists that only months are required. Yet the real obstacle, almost certainly, is Soviet unwillingness to see the triumph of an Islamic tribal insurgency over a Marxist client regime. At stake in Moscow's eyes is the Communist doctrine that the march of Soviet power is irreversible. But that doctrine, like the war, has unacknowledged roots in the czarist past. Under Alexander II (1855-81), Russia added 400,000 square miles of territory in Central Asia, as big as Western Europe. Over time the czars overwhelmed resistance, and in an imperial age, nobody cared. The difference now in Afghanistan is that much of the world does care.\nThe test for Mr. Gorbachev, as it was for the United States in Vietnam, is whether he is prepared to lose, or risk losing. To acknowledge a blunder of such magnitude would have adverse repercussions for Soviet power at home and in Eastern Europe -though it also might open the way for a rapprochement with China.\nBut carrying on is hardly more attractive. Short of Moscow's sending a million troops, the Afghan resistance is bound to continue. What's worse: the costs of admitting a huge mistake or of indefinitely bleeding the Soviet Union and an Islamic neighbor? If Mr. Gorbachev is big enough to scorn the latter course, he can bring this cruel war finally and mercifully to an end.

The station denied any bias.\nA Hispanic coalition filed a Federal job-discrimination complaint Tuesday against KCBS-TV, accusing the station of racial bias in hiring and promoting on- and off-camera employees. The station denied any bias.\nThe formal complaint to the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission seeks imposition of an affirmative-action program at KCBS, said John Huerta, an attorney representing a group called the Hispanic Media Coalition.\nThe commission would have to sue in Federal court if it decided there was merit to the accusations, Mr. Huerta said.\nMr. Huerta said that of the station's about 400 employees, 14.2 percent were Hispanic. Mr. Huerta contended the percentage was far too low considering that 29 percent of the city's labor force is Hispanic.\nKCBS said it helps pay for a national computerized job bank for Hispanics.\n''We are surprised that the group chose to target a station which not only has the best Hispanic employment record in the market, but has also been involved for several years in helping improve this situation nationally,'' said Tom Van Amburg, KCBS's vice president and general manager, in a written statement.\nMr. Huerta said that the coalition had discussed minority hiring with station managers, but that the talks broke down in November when KCBS laid off about 20 workers, half of them minorities.
116	U.S. LIFTS OBSTACLE TO ROAD LEADING TO CARTER COMPLEX	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DE163FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A Federal district judge here has removed the last Federal obstacle to construction of a 2.4-mile-long highway that will provide easy access between downtown Atlanta and the Carter Presidential Center. He ruled that state highway officials had satisfied all environmental concerns.\nA Federal district judge here has removed the last Federal obstacle to construction of a 2.4-mile-long highway that will provide easy access between downtown Atlanta and the Carter Presidential Center. He ruled that state highway officials had satisfied all environmental concerns.\nThe decision by the judge, William C. O'Kelley, handed down last week, does nothing, however, to remove local opposition to the $22 million Presidential Parkway, nor does it lift an injunction imposed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\nAlva Byrom, an engineer in the State Highway Department, said that the Federal ruling ''obviously relieves us of any problems with the Federal Government.'' But highway officials will still have to get the Georgia court to lift its injunction if it is to proceed with condeming land for the road.\nThe State Supreme Court ruled in November that the Highway Department could not condemn land under a television broadcast tower owned by Cox Communications because motorists could be endangered by falling ice, which sometimes forms on the tower's guy wires. Mr. Byrom said, ''We intend to finalize the right of way and settle with Cox, but I have no idea when that will be.'' Appeal Almost Certain\nAn appeal of the Federal court decision by opponents of the parkway is almost certain. Sally Dorn, a lawyer and co-chairman of a neighborhood group opposed to the road, said: ''There is no question that the judge erred, it's just a matter of where. We clearly feel that the decision is an appealable order.''\nMiss Dorn's group has snarled the state's construction efforts almost from the beginning. A bid for the parkway was let in November 1984, but opponents were able to get a temporary restraining order in February 1985. Although some bridge abutments were built, land was cleared and trees were felled, construction has been at a standstill ever since.\nWithout the parkway, visitors must use residential streets to reach the center from downtown Atlanta. Despite the increased traffic, residents of the area around the center oppose the parkway because they say it would destroy public parks and the ambiance of historical neighborhoods.\nExcept to say that the parkway is necessary, former President Jimmy Carter and officials of the 133,000-square-foot Carter Presidential Center, which was dedicated this fall, have avoided comment on the project. $25 Million Complex The former President hopes the $25 million complex will play an important role in promoting human rights and combating world hunger. The center consists of the Presidential Museum, the Jimmy Carter Library, Global 2000, the Carter Center of Emory University and the Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation.\nThe museum is the only part of the complex already accessible to the public. In the first two months of its operation, about 750 people a day visited it. That rate is less than half the pace projected by officials, who foresaw 600,000 annual visitors. That estimate assumed the parkway would be built.\nThe library is to house 27 million documents from Mr. Carter's presidency. Frank Ranew, a spokesman for the center, said: ''The documents are being moved in and filed. By the end of January, the research center will open for use by scholars.'' Health and Agricultural Projects\nGlobal 2000's aim is to cultivate primary health care in underdeveloped countries and to initiate agricultural programs in starving nations. Mr. Ranew said Global 2000 programs wee under way in the Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana and Zimbabwe.\nThe Carter Center of Emory University has nine fellows, all Emory University professors. ''It's designed for scholarly research in the area of human rights, peace in the Middle East, nuclear disarmament and the like,'' Mr. Ranew said.\nThe Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation, the newest facet of the center, recently bestowed its first honor, a $100,000 prize to be shared by the Soviet dissident Yuri F. Orlov and Mutual Support Group, a human rights organization in Guatemala.

Time calls it ''Iranscam,'' and The Economist favors ''Iranagua.'' A New Republic contest awarded the prize to ''Iranamok.'' Others put the emphasis on Latin America, proposing ''Contra-Diction,'' ''Contra Mundo'' and the inevitable ''Contragate.'' America's best-known Marine colonel is immortalized in ''Olliewood,'' ''Oliver's Twist'' and ''Ollie's Follies.'' Then there's the sniggering ''Deep Gloat'' and ''Gipperloo.''\nAll these nominations make good sport but poor titles. A look at history helps explain why.\nGenerally speaking, tags for past fiascos fall into three categories: places, people and jargon. Examples of the first start with the South Sea Bubble (1720), a financial scandal that claimed fortunes and reputations in Georgian England. Teapot Dome (1924) was named after the Wyoming oilfields whose corrupt leasing forever tarred Warren Harding. Suez (1956) is synonymous with the collusive and aborted attempt by Britain, France and Israel to reclaim the Suez Canal and depose President Nasser of Egypt. Closer to home is the Bay of Pigs (1961), the swamp in Cuba that swallowed up John F. Kennedy's exile army - and, of course, Watergate (1972), the Potomac complex in which the Nixon scandal begin to twist, slowly, in the wind.\nPeople's names are as rich a source. France's Third Republic was nearly sundered by the Dreyfus Affair (1894), stirred by a military conspiracy to frame Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew, on treason charges. In Britain, where scandals usually involve sexual misbehavior, the most celebrated bears the name of John Profumo (1963), a Minister of the Crown whose dalliances hurried the resignation of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.\nFinally, there's bureaucratic shorthand, as in Abscam (1980), the F.B.I. sting operation in which agents in Arab garb offered bribes to susceptible members of Congress.\nThe problem with trying to name the present White House crisis is that it involves too much geography and too many people for any single, easy label. Russell Baker proposes, in the Sherlockian spirit, ''The Poindexter Affair.'' Clever, but no cigar. Neither Doyle nor Roget's offer shorthand long enough. It remains, for short, the Iran-contra arms scandal.
118	LINK OF FAT TO BREAST CANCER DISPUTED	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DB163FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Low-fat diets, widely recommended as a means of preventing breast cancer, fail to protect women from this common killer, a major new study concludes.\nLow-fat diets, widely recommended as a means of preventing breast cancer, fail to protect women from this common killer, a major new study concludes.\nThe finding means there is apparently no practical way for women to protect themselves from breast cancer, a disease that strikes one of every 11 American women. The researcher cautioned, however, that women who have already reduced their fat intake should not revert to a high-fat diet on the basis of these findings.\n''Within this study, there is really no support for an association between dietary fat and breast cancer,'' said Dr. Walter C. Willett of Harvard Medical School.\nDr. Willett's study, based on the eating habits of nearly 90,000 nurses, found that those on relatively high-fat diets had less breast cancer than those whose eating habits mirrored the low-fat recommendations of the National Cancer Institute and other organizations. Other Reasons to Avoid Fat\nHowever, Dr. Willett said, even if a low-fat diet does not stop breast cancer, avoiding fat is still wise because this can reduce the risk of heart disease. ''Furthermore, the possibility exists that a moderate reduction in fat may reduce the risk of cancer at sites other than the breast,'' he said. ''However, this remains to be established.''\nHe said an ''important implication'' of this finding was that alternative methods to reduce the risk of breast cancer must be found. He stressed the importance of routine breast self-examination and mammography, or X-rays of the breast, to detect the disease early. But ''at this point,'' he said, ''there is little that a woman can do to reduce her risk of breast cancer with any degree of confidence.''\nAlthough some suggest that a more drastic reduction in fat consumption to 20 percent of total calories will prevent breast cancer, Dr. Willett said his study neither disproved nor supported that theory.\nDr. Daniel Nixon of Emory University, a proponent of the diet cancer theory, said the new research ''flies in the face of animal studies,'' which show that dietary fat promotes breast cancer in laboratory animals. But he said the large size of the Harvard study made it ''hard to argue with.'' Contrary to Common Belief\nDr. Willett's research, published in the latest issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, disputes an idea that has been widely repeated in recent years.\nThe National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society and the National Academy of Sciences, among others, have recommended diets intended to ward off breast cancer and other forms of cancer. In general, they propose that women restrict their fat consumption to 30 percent of their total calories, rather than the more common 40 percent.\nDietary fat has been implicated in other forms of cancer. In last week's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, two European studies provided circumstantial evidence that high-fat diets might contribute to colon cancer.\nIn Dr. Willett's study, 89,538 nurses from around the United States kept track of their daily consumption of a variety of nutrients, including fat. After four years, 601 of them had got breast cancer. Those on low-fat diets were not spared the disease.\nIn fact, those whose fat consumption averaged 44 percent of their daily calories had an 18 percent lower risk of cancer than did those who ate 32 percent of their calories as fat. However, this difference was not statistically meaningful. Not the Final Word\nSeveral experts said that the Harvard study was unlikely to be the last word on this issue.\n''This is a good study, but it's not the only one,'' said Dr. Peter Greenwald, director of the cancer institute's division of cancer protection. He said the institute would continue to recommend that Americans cut back on fat and total calories while increasing their consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole-grain cereals and starches.\nDr. Johanna Dwyer of the New England Medical Center said, ''Maybe Dr. Willett feels he has annihilated the N.C.I. guidelines, but I think we'll have a lot of different studies before that happens.''\nDr. Willett said there appeared to be little a woman could do to reduce her risk of breast cancer. ''The best method is to have many children and have them early,'' he said. ''That, unfortunately, is impractical.''\nAn estimated 123,000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States in 1986, and 40,200 women died from it. Among factors known to increase the risk of the disease are a family history of breast cancer, never having children or having a first child after the age of 30.\nDr. Willett said no one knew why women in some parts of the world had a better chance of escaping breast cancer. However, he said, one explanation might be restriction of food intake in childhood or adolescence. Such food deprivation probably has to be severe enough to stunt children's growth.\n''If that's true, it's in a way unfortunate, because it doesn't lead to any practical intervention,'' he said. ''We're certainly not going to hold back food from our kids so much that they'll grow shorter.''

'From a Moral Perspective'\nPapal sponsorship, the Cardinal said, could be seen as an alternative should the other approaches prove unworkable.\nHowever, he said he had not discussed the proposal with Vatican officials, whom he plans to see after completing his visit to Israel on Jan. 5. ''If Rome doesn't consider it a good idea, it will last a quarter of a second,'' he said.\nThe Cardinal, who is the Archbishop of New York, said he was not making the proposal out of any expertise on the Middle East but because ''I think it's a good idea to bring participants in any conflict together.''\nAs with his calls for self-determination for the Palestinian people, he said he was ''attempting to answer questions from a moral perspective.''\nThe Cardinal's decision to visit Israel grew out of criticism by Israeli and American Jewish groups of remarks he made favoring the idea of a Palestinian homeland. Meetings Are Canceled\nA diplomatic controversy has arisen over his decision, under Vatican pressure, to cancel meetings with several high-ranking Israeli officials. The Vatican has indicated that it objects principally to the idea that the Cardinal was to hold the meetings in Jerusalem, which it does not recognize as Israel's capital.\nThe Cardinal said the Vatican would be a fitting sponsor for an international conference because it is ''the one worldwide moral entity that might be seen as most objective, that has generally been seen as pursuing peace over the years.''\nAt a news conference concluding his three-and-a-half-day visit to Jordan, the Cardinal also repeatedly urged Americans to ''rid ourselves of stereotypes'' of Arabs and Palestinians as terrorists.\n''This is a grossly distorted image of a deep and ancient culture,'' he said. ''There is a deep yearning for peace on the part of Arab countries.''\nStill, he added, ''one cannot excuse those guilty of terrorist acts for helping to bring about this image.'' Good Will Toward Israelis\nThe Cardinal's statement today followed several other assertions he has made while in Jordan that may not sit well with Israeli officials.\nThe Cardinal's urging that self-determination be granted to the Palestinian people is a linguistic formula for Palestinian political rights that neither Israel nor the United States has accepted. He has also suggested that unless the Palestinian problem is solved soon, Middle East tensions could spill over into war within a year or two.\nAsked today whether his recent statements on the Palestinians would rub salt in Israeli wounds, he responded: ''It's always a possibility, but it was never intended. I have nothing but good will toward the Israeli people.''\nBut, he said, ''I must say what I believe'' and that ''doesn't cast any aspersions on the Israeli people.'' He compared his speaking out on the Palestinians to his statements expressing concern about homelessness in New York. In speaking out about the homeless crisis in New York, he said he was calling attention to a severe problem that demands correction, not blaming the Reagan, Cuomo or Koch administrations. Visits Refugee Centers\nSimilarly, he said, there are ''hundreds of thousands of homeless people in Palestine'' living in refugee centers that he must speak out about without necessarily blaming Israel.\nThe Cardinal's decision to display his sympathy for the plight of the Palestinians has been apparent from some of the stops he chose to make in Jordan. On Monday, he visited the Baqaa refugee center, a crowded and squalid place of more than 65,000 refugees displaced by the 1967 Mideast war.\nToday, he visited a clinic for pregnant women and new mothers and their children, whose clients are largely Palestinians from the Schneller refugee center in Amman. The clinic is run by the Pontifical Mission for Palestine, a Vatican agency to aid Palestinian refugees that is financed by an American group headed by the Cardinal.\nDr. Mazin S. Hanna, the clinic's 36-year-old Palestinian doctor, told the Cardinal that there was much less malnutrition than years before but that because of sanitary conditions at the center many of the children he sees still suffer from diarrhea and frequent bacterial infections.\nEmerging from the clinic into a bright morning sun, the Cardinal said the visit had persuaded him that the Palestinian patients there ''are certainly not in any way masters of their own destiny.''\nAsked why he was choosing to make so many strong statements about the plight of the Palestinians, the Cardinal said: ''Only because I'm here. I didn't come with any vision of doing this. When I get among a people like this, more thoughts come to my mind.''\nWhen he gets to Israel, he said, ''I hope to demonstrate my balance.''

The company was able to charge more than $359 million above allowed prices by transferring its oil through a number of companies and circumventing investigators, the report said.\nThe article, which cited a copy of an internal Energy Department draft of a proposed remedial order, said that company employees had testified that Petrofina's chairman, Paul D. Meek, and other executives knew about the pricing scheme and had concealed the violations from Federal investigators.\n''We understand that a review is under way, but no final decision has been made by the D.O.E. to bring any action against Fina,'' the company said today.

Shultz, who has complained publicly that sharp reductions by Congress in the foreign affairs budget had ''cut the legs right out from under us,'' has agreed to take the lead in the public relations effort for the $1.3 billion increase, officials said.\nThe foreign affairs budget includes money allocated to foreign aid, international lending institutions, embassy protection and overseas radio broadcasting.\nA high department official acknowledged today that the new drive, which Mr. Shultz will open on Monday at a news conference, may include ''some unusual gimmicks.'' May Use a T-Shirt\nHe said, for instance, that to get attention in coming weeks, Mr. Shultz was considering holding up a child's T-shirt with ''1987'' written on it and comparing his getting into the shirt with the difficulty of meeting the nation's national security obligations with a budget that makes it impossible.\nThe Administration had originally sought $22 billion for its foreign affairs account in the current 1987 fiscal year, but Congress cut it to $16.6 billion. Because Israel and Egypt were guaranteed by Congress to receive $3 billion and $2.1 billion respectively, this has led to drastic cuts in funds for other nations.\nThe alternative to such cuts would be for Congress to approve a supplemental request, which is to be announced on Monday. Also to be announced is the target of $19 billion for the overall foreign affairs budget for the 1988 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1.\nBecause of the priority given to the campaign to increase the money available for foreign aid and other international programs, the State Department was permitted by the Office of Management and Budget to begin briefing key members of Congress and their staffs a week earlier than usual. The briefings have taken place this week. Reaction Not Encouraging\nBut the initial reaction from Congress, State Department officials said, was not very encouraging. Congress, in cutting back on foreign aid this year, had made the point that it would listen to requests for raising the total only if the Administration proposed a tax increase to cover the additional costs or could show that the increase was offset elsewhere in the budget.\n''It all depends on the nature of the offsets - otherwise the request is D.O.A.,'' a department official said, using the acronym for ''dead on arrival.''\nA major reason for the supplemental request was to meet commitments to allies that permit rights for American bases, officials said.\nThe request includes $50 million in military grants for the Philippines, doubling the amount previously allocated for 1987. It calls for $200 million in low-interest credits to Spain, in addition to the $105 million allocated already.\nTurkey would receive $125 million in military grants in addition to the $490 million approved in the regular 1987 allocation for grants and loans. Portugal would receive $30 million in grants above the previous $80 million. To Aid African Railroad\nIn addition, the supplemental request includes $297 million in cash grants above the $3.55 billion previously approved. This includes $50 million to help South Africa's neighbors put into operation a railroad ending in Mozambique to avoid the need to use South Africa's ports. The supplemental request would also provide an additional grant of $200 million for Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica.\nThe United States Information Agency would receive an additional $17.7 million, and the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty would receive nearly $25 million to cover the deficits caused by the decline of the dollar overseas.\nIn the 1988 budget request, the Administration is seeking $500 million to cover a special fund for hunger relief in Africa, as well as an additional $100 million for the continent, for a total of $600 million, well above the $486 million now allocated.\nThe military assistance being sought in 1988 amounts to $5.7 billion, an increase over the less than $5 billion approved in 1987, but less than the $6.6 billion originally requested for 1987.

Or a bit of baseball trivia.\nHe was born in Dodge City, Kan., and as a teen-ager drove a stagecoach for tourists around Boot Hill. It never occurred to Mark Liebl that he would grow up to be a real-life desperado. Or a bit of baseball trivia.\nLiebl is the man authorities tabbed as the kingpin in the first prosecution of a cocaine case involving a group of major league players. His frequent companions included many members of the 1983 Kansas City Royals, four of whom - Vida Blue, Willie Wilson, Willie Aikens and Jerry Martin -were ultimately imprisoned as a result of an investigation that centered on him. Except for Blue, who was sentenced for cocaine possession, the players all pleaded guity to reduced charges of attempts to possess, after calls they made to Liebl's house were intercepted by Federal agents.\nBlue, Wilson, Aikens and Martin served only 90 days each, plus brief suspensions from baseball, before resuming their careers. Liebl, who pleaded guilty of distribution, served nearly two and a half years in the Fort Worth Correctional Institute. He was released in October and is still feeling some wonder at the day-to-day pleasantries of life as a free man.\n''Just being able to go running or swimming or buy a candy bar any time I feel like it,'' he told a caller yesterday, speaking of the moments he finds both thrilling and odd. ''All the little things you take for granted.''\nNow 36, he feels only ''shame'' at his past as a drug supplier, but believes his arrest allowed him to survive his own cocaine addiction. His parole requires him to attend weekly drug counseling sessions and to submit to regular urinalysis, conditions he is happy to comply with. He spent his first free Christmas with his girlfriend in Arlington, Tex., where he now lives, and planned a quiet dinner for New Year's Eve. ''I'm not ready yet for all that traffic,'' he said.\nHis arrest cost him his Kansas City liquor business and $25,000 in legal fees, but Liebl is hoping to open a restaurant soon. He is now working in his brother's furniture business.\nAs for baseball, prison didn't cool his passion. ''I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of Ranger games this year,'' he said. ''But I'm still a Royals fan at heart, and always will be.''\nLiebl has seen Aikens and Wilson once since getting out of prison and, far from being bitter at the difference in sentences, still calls them good friends. The conversations centered mostly on reminiscence. ''We talked about the past,'' he said, ''realized how we made mistakes. We all just said we want to continue on.'' SCOUTING
123	PRICES PAID TO FARMERS DOWN 2.4%	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6163FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The prices that farmers received for raw products in December were an average of 2.4 percent below November's levels, and ended 1986 down 5.5 percent from a year ago, the Agriculture Department said today.\nThe prices that farmers received for raw products in December were an average of 2.4 percent below November's levels, and ended 1986 down 5.5 percent from a year ago, the Agriculture Department said today.\nDepartment officials say the nation's farm income has generally stabilized and could show ''moderate growth'' in 1987. But the slide in farmland values was expected to continue, further eroding assets and reducing the borrowing power of farmers.\nThe report said that lower prices for oranges, tomatoes, broilers, cattle, hogs and turkeys contributed most to the decline in the price index from its November level. Higher prices for cotton, strawberries, corn and lettuce helped soften the drop.\nNo new figures were reported for the prices paid by farmers to meet expenses. The most recent average computed in October showed farm expenses running six-tenths of 1 percent below levels a year earlier. The next quarterly revision of that index is scheduled in January. Beef and Hog Prices Drop\nChanges in grain prices were mixed in December, the report said. Prices for beef cattle and hogs were down, but calf prices were higher.\n''Average lamb prices were up sharply, but broiler and egg prices were down,'' the report said. ''The all-milk price was unchanged. Sharply lower prices for oranges and tomatoes were important factors in the month-to-month decrease of the commercial vegetable and all-fruit indexes.''\nAccording to the preliminary December figures, based mostly on midmonth averages, prices of crops declined by an average of 2.9 percent from November and 16 percent from December 1985.\nPrices of commercial vegetables at the farm were down 14 percent from November and 28 from the period a year ago. Prices for sweet corn, onions, celery and carrots dropped, while prices for lettuce rose slightly.\nFruit prices in December dropped 11 percent from November and were 2.3 percent below levels of a year earlier, primarily because of a sharp decline in the prices of oranges. Higher prices for strawberries and grapefruit partly offset the drop.\nPrices for feed grain and hay rose 1.3 percent from November but were down 29 percent from a year earlier.\nThe price index for livestock and livestock products was down 2.8 percent from November but up 2.9 percent from December 1985.\nNet farm income is forecast by the Agriculture Department at about $28 billion this year, down from $30.5 billion in 1985. Economists are forecasting an increase to about $32 billion in 1987.

Jet Crashed in Saudi Arabia\nThe Iraqi Airways Boeing 727, which was on a scheduled flight from Baghdad to Amman, crash-landed and blew up near a remote airfield in northern Saudi Arabia. Survivors said that hijackers exploded two grenades in the passenger cabin and that a gun fight broke out with security guards.\nAll of the dead passengers were reported to have been from Arab and Moslem countries.\nSaudi Arabia has not even officially said that a hijacking attempt took place. It also declined to investigate the accident itself, as required under international aviation rules. Instead, Saudi Arabia sent survivors, the dead bodies and key parts of the plane to Baghdad at Iraq's request.\nAsked about the whereabouts of the plane's flight recorder, which records all activities in the pilot's cabin, the Jordanian official said he assumed the device had been sent to Baghdad. The ''black box'' is usually a key element in any airline accident investigation. No Word From Iraq\nThe Iraqi authorities have also withheld information about the hijacking, beyond making public the names of the dead and saying they were citizens of Iraq, Jordan, the Sudan and Egypt. Most of the survivors are believed to be still in Baghdad.\nAt first, the Jordanian authorities expressed anger with the withholding of information by Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Amman pressed them to reveal more about the incident and passed on what they already knew to Western reporters.\nIn particular, Jordanian officials said they suspected that the hijackers had been helped in smuggling weapons aboard the plane through the Baghdad airport's tight security system by dissident elements in the police and that the hijackers might even have been dissident security guards themselves.\nBut a high-ranking Jordanian official has now said that the Jordanian Government considers the matter closed and will say nothing more about it.\nJordanian journalists said that local papers had been told by the Government to drop the story.\nThe Jordanian official indicated that Amman did not want to embarrass President Saddam Hussein of Iraq further at a time when he is locked in a bitter six-year-old war with Iran. J Western diplomats in Amman say that Iraq and Saudi Arabia are able to hush up the hijacking incident only because no Americans or other Western citizens were involved. As a result, Western governments are not pressing for a full, public inquiry.

127	LOYALTY MOTIVATES LIONS LINEBACKER	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DC173FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: He was reluctant to leave Penn State with an incomplete grade in football. Shane Conlan decided that to come so close to being part of the No. 1 team in the country last season, and then pass up a second chance, would be like a student quitting school only a few credits short of earning a degree. What's more, there was a matter of loyalty, no small consideration in this case.\nHe was reluctant to leave Penn State with an incomplete grade in football. Shane Conlan decided that to come so close to being part of the No. 1 team in the country last season, and then pass up a second chance, would be like a student quitting school only a few credits short of earning a degree. What's more, there was a matter of loyalty, no small consideration in this case.\nConlan hears the Lion's roar more loudly than most at State College, Pa. The all-America linebacker has always appreciated that Penn State was the only school that actively recruited him five years ago when he was a raw-boned 185-pound defensive back from Frewsburg, N.Y., not a popular stopping point on the recruiting trail.\n''I was getting upset at the time because there was no real solid recruitment,'' Conlan said. ''I was amazed that Penn State showed that much interest. They took the time to look, made the effort to watch game films.''\nConlan was red-shirted in his freshman year, 1982, when Penn State finished No. 1 for the first time. It was a year of transition. The coaches liked his aggressiveness, his lean and hungry look. He had the ability to cover a lot of ground. They sent him to the weight room, building him up into a linebacker without sacrificing quickness. Rated With the Best\nConlan became one of the best at his position, as good as Oklahoma's Brian Bosworth, Joe Paterno, the Nittany Lions' coach believes, if not as well publicized. Conlan is expected to be a first-round pick in the National Football League draft, the latest in a succession of Penn State linebackers to be coveted by the pros.\nConlan could have already been playing in the N.F.L. After Oklahoma spoiled Penn State's bid to finish No. 1 in the Orange Bowl last New Year's night, he was urged by his father, a New York State trooper, to pass up his final year of eligibility since his class was graduating. There appeared to be little to gain by returning to Penn State.\n''But falling short last year made me want to come back,'' he said. ''And I'm glad I did.'' There were practical steps to take, however, such as protecting Conlan's potential worth as a professional football player. His parents took out a life insurance policy in their son's name this year, protecting him in case of injury in a high risk sport. Conlan was evasive about the amount of coverage or what it cost, saying he was insured for between $500,000 and $1 million. It cost his parents between $5,000 and $10,000, he said.\nIt might be considered a wise investment. Conlan plays with a recklessness that belies his clean-cut look and polite manners. He has the square-jawed Clark Kent profile, neatly trimmed brown hair and an easy smile. He says he has become friendly with Vinny Testaverde, the Miami quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner, whom Conlan will be chasing on Friday night in the Fiesta Bowl, because they have similiar personalities. They met after being named to an all-America team.\n''I've gotten to know Vinny really well,'' Conlan said. ''He's like me, confident, but humble.'' Sometimes Too Aggressive\nThe team psychologist for the San Diego Chargers several years ago once characterized linebackers as having the personalities of assassins. Conlan, who is 6 feet 3 inches and 225 pounds, has disturbed Paterno on occasion because of his penchant for drawing unsportsmanlike penalties for being too aggressive.\n''I play better when I'm mad,'' he said. ''I was so mad against Notre Dame, for instance, especially Steve Beuerlein.'' Conlan was angered when the Notre Dame quarterback said it would not be a big upset if his team defeated Penn State.\n''I'm not mad at Miami, yet,'' Conlan said. ''But regardless of whether I'm friendly with Testaverde, I want to hit Vinny as hard as I can on Friday. I would feel that way even against my brother or mother.''\nIt is Penn State's ferocious tackling that worries Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach. He said his team depends on turning short passing plays into long gains by breaking tackles.\nConlan said the Penn State defense brings realistic goals into the game. ''They are going to score,'' he said. ''Testaverde is a seasoned quarterback. It's not like they will put us in a magic defense and we'll sack him 10 times.\n''But we have to slow them down, force some turnovers. If that means me moving around more, then fine. I like running around.'' FIESTA BOWL

The venture would be financed partly by the trading companies of Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Nissho Iwai, which would handle the steel sales to Japanese automobile plants, the reports said.\nAn Inland spokesman, Charles A. Nekvasil, said that negotiations were continuing and that ''no deal has been presented to the board of directors.'' The spokesman added that the financing of the deal had not yet been worked out. ''Nothing has been set yet,'' he said.\nThe Inland spokesman said the company was eager to reach an agreement, noting that the two companies had been negotiating for more than two years to build a continuous cold mill facility in this country. The spokesman said the plant would use technology developed by Nippon to produce the kind of smooth, high-quality steel that is eagerly sought by Detroit's auto makers.\nThe spokesman said the plant would be patterned after a similar facility operated by Nippon Steel in Hirohota, Japan.\nNippon Steel, the world's largest steel company, has had domestic problems in recent months, a result of a strong yen, slumping exports and low domestic demand. Last week, the company announced that it was closing five of its twelve blast furnaces.
129	FIRST CHICAGO TO BUY DELAWARE BANK	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDB173FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Increasing its stake in the credit-card business, the First Chicago Corporation said today that it would buy the Beneficial National Bank in Wilmington, Del., from the Beneficial Corporation for $247 million.\nIncreasing its stake in the credit-card business, the First Chicago Corporation said today that it would buy the Beneficial National Bank in Wilmington, Del., from the Beneficial Corporation for $247 million.\nAnalysts said the acquisition would make First Chicago, already the nation's fifth-largest issuer of credit cards, a more potent player. Currently, it has $3.4 billion in outstanding balances and three million card holders. Beneficial National, whose primary business is the issuance of Visa and Mastercard credit cards, is the 12th-largest card issuer.\nThe move would also give First Chicago, which is incorporated in Delaware, its first operating unit in that state. 'Growth in a Big Step'\n''They can achieve growth in a big step with this acquisition,'' said Ronald I. Mandle, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc., who added that he expected Beneficial to contribute to First Chicago's earnings in ''a couple of years.''\nFor the Beneficial Corporation, a consumer finance company, the sale would aid in its restructuring. Two weeks ago, the Delaware company said it would sell about $1.4 billion in assets. The announcement came after it was unable to negotiate a takeover agreement with an unidentified corporation, rumored to have been the Transamerica Corporation, for about $1.74 billion.\nBeneficial said it now plans to concentrate on its consumer lending operations. A spokesman for the company said proceeds from this sale and from the expected sale of its insurance operations would be used to refinance debt and to repurchase shares.\nBeneficial National is not considered a full service bank - defined as an institution that takes commercial deposits and makes consumer loans. Beneficial officials said the bank takes in commercial deposits, but does not make consumer loans. It only issues credit cards. Of the bank's total assets of $1.1 billion, about $1 billion are receivables on credit-card accounts. Regulatory Approval Expected\nBank and industry analysts said they do not expect regulatory problems. Typically, a bank acquisition across state lines requires approval from state and Federal authorities.\nA spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates bank holding companies, said, ''Although we have to look at First Chicago's application, the subject is not without precedent.''\nOn the state level, the issue is a little more cloudy because the sale is subject to approval by Delaware officials. ''It would be premature to issue any reponse,'' said Susan I. Winters, deputy commissioner in the Office of the State Bank Commisioner of Delaware.\nFirst Chicago officials remained confident that they would receive regulatory approval and complete the deal by mid-1987. ''It is a credit-card business, which happens to be imbedded in a bank,'' said Leo F. Mullin, First Chicago's executive vice president of consumer banking.
130	1986's CHARITABLE TAX RUSH	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DA173FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A surge in year-end charitable giving has taken place across the United States, as many donors rushed to make their gifts before the new tax law went into effect today.\nA surge in year-end charitable giving has taken place across the United States, as many donors rushed to make their gifts before the new tax law went into effect today.\nColleges, universities and religious organizations generally report a marked increase in contributions; less so the arts.\nMost of the gifts were traditional -cash and securities. But others were unusual, ranging from Persian rugs to cases of wine. Indeed, in one instance, a majority interest in a vineyard was donated. A number of environmental groups also received substantial gifts of property.\nMany, but not all, of the benefiting organizations said contributors acted to get maximum benefits under the expiring tax code. In 1987, gifts from individuals and corporations to the country's 1 million nonprofit organizations will be subject to the new Tax Reform Act. The law affects charitable giving to educational institutions, libraries, hospitals, museums, religious organizations, welfare agencies and cultural groups. $11 Billion Loss Seen The Independent Sector - the country's largest philanthropic coalition - estimates that, under the new tax law, nonprofit organizations will lose at least $11 billion in charitable contributions annually. However, others dispute that estimate as unduly pessimistic.\nMany large nonprofit organizations, such as universities, depend on receiving from donors securities that have appreciated in value; the donors in the past have gotten sizable tax write-offs. But under the new law, the appreciated portion of such gifts will be subject to alternative minimum tax treatment for the first time. The coalition estimated this provision alone will mean $1 billion less for nonprofit organizations.\nSome wealthy donors have been fulfilling two- and three-year pledges ahead of schedule, according to Brian O'Connell, the coalition's president. Consequently, it will be much tougher to come near the same levels of giving in 1987 and 1988, he acknowledged. However, he also argued that although tax policies influence the size of gifts, donors will continue to give ''for all the right reasons.''\nTraditionally, the time between Thanksgiving and New Year's is the busiest period for fund-raisers. In recent months, many buttressed their usual appeals by arguing the tax advantages of giving in 1986. Stanley S. Weithorn, a New York lawyer and tax adviser to both nonprofit groups and wealthy donors, also emphasized to clients that the old law applies to any gift mailed before midnight yesterday, even though it may be received by the beneficiary in 1987. 'The Most Generous Month'\n''Columbia University is expecting December to be the most generous month in its history in terms of private donations,'' Norman S. Fink, deputy vice president for development and alumni relations, said recently. He estimated that $10 million in gifts would be received for December. The University began a five-year drive in 1982 to raise $500 million.\nYale University received more than $11 million in December, more than double the amount of money received from individuals during December 1985. Many of the gifts were appreciated securities, and reflected the donors' interest in acting before the Dec. 31 deadline, according to Sue Dorn, associate vice president for development.\nYale also received some nontraditional gifts, one of them 13 cases of wine valued between $30,000 and $40,000. The gift, from Mr. and Mrs. A. Abner Rosen of New York, is to be used - for official purposes - by Yale's president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., a provision that insures the donor receives a full tax deduction, which would not be so if the wine was sold or auctioned.\nIn California, Claremont McKenna College reported that the number of donors for 1986 is 46 percent ahead of 1985, even though the total of funds is down 15 percent. This suggests an increase of contributions from smaller non-itemizing taxpayers, who will no longer get a deduction for their charitable gifts under the new tax code, Jon Keates, vice president for development, said.\nThe college has also received some nontraditional gifts, one of them an 80 percent interest in a 122-acre vineyard in the Sonoma Valley, valued, Mr. Keates said, in the ''half-million range.''\nCultural organizations were more cautious in reporting their year-end contributions. 'We've Had Nice Support'\n''We've had nice support, not as dramatic as it might have been, but above last year's year-end contributions,'' said Joe McKoughan, vice president for public affairs at Lincoln Center Inc.\nIt is difficult for arts groups to ''try to keep up with our brothers and sisters in the education field, '' said Milton Rhodes, president of the American Council for the Arts. The council's 2,900 members include orchestras, museums, opera and dance companies and theater groups.\nPhilippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolian Museum of Art, said, ''I cannot say there is an unusual surge compared with last year, but it is a good year.''\nAlbert K. Webster, executive vice president and managing director of the New York Philharmonic, said, ''If the national trend is increased philanthropy, I'm disappointed the world of arts doesn't have a higher priority.'' He added that orchestras are generally ''holding their own, but obviously donors are making choices, and we all know education and religion have high priorities.''\nGifts to religious organizations tend to increase toward the end of the year, and Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York is running about a half-million dollars ahead of 1985, according to Msgr. James J. Murray, executive director. Some of the contributions are made as appreciated securities. ''The tax law has had some influence on the increased contributions, but the giving also reflects people's concern for others, and particularly the more visible homeless,'' he said. A 20 Percent Increase\nFund raising for the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York is running about 20 percent ahead of last year's drive, Stephen Solender, executive vice president, said.\nHe stated: ''We expected to achieve this level, and if we had achieved a significantly higher level, it would have confirmed that the new tax law was leading people to give, before Dec. 31, the contributions they would have spread out over future years. Our experience suggests that predictions about the negative impact of the law, which were made four or five months ago, were probably overstated.\nThe New York Public Library is having a ''tremendous'' volume in gifts, according to Vartan Gregorian, its president, but he attributed the increase to the library's five-year fund-raising drive, not the tax law.\nMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has received more end-of-the-year gifts than in prior years, particularly in the form of appreciated securities, Mortimer H. Chute, vice president for development, said. The center also received two unusual gifts. One was a 117-acre estate in the rolling countryside of Flemington, N.J., valued at $2.9 million, and the other a 17th-century Persian carpet, valued at $175,000.\nThe New York Community Trust, one of the country's wealthiest foundations, opened up a record number of 100 new charitable funds for donors, Herbert B. West, the director, said. He said some were initial gifts to be augmented in future and were made by tax lawyers and investors ''who really know the business.'' 'Heavy Tax Weather'\nBut the altered tax code could mean difficulties for newer community foundations, according to Thomas A.Troyer, a Washington lawyer and consultant to the Council on Foundations. Such foundations depend on gifts of appreciated property. ''The coming year will see heavy tax weather for a range of small community foundations starting up around the country,'' he said.\nThe Nature Conservancy, the land-acquisition arm for the country's environmental movement, is experiencing a ''tremendous increase'' in gifts of appreciated properties and securities, according to John Jensen, vice president for development. He said the contributions undoubtedly were a result of the tax changes.\nUnited Way pledges, made mainly through payroll deductions, are not expected to be affected by the tax code change, according to Jack Moskowitz, a senior vice president, estimating that pledges paid out in 1987 would be about 6 to 8 percent above the $2.3 billion received last year.

Repurchase agreements are a common practice among large investing institutions, banks and securities dealers.\nAt the Treasury's weekly bill auction, the average discount rate for a three-month bill rose one basis point, to 5.68 percent, its highest level since last August. Six-month bills increased by 12 basis points, also to 5.68 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\nThe Bank Rate Monitor's national index showed the average yield for a six-month certificate of deposit up two basis points, to 5.92 percent, and the average yield of a bank money market account, which competes with money market mutual funds, unchanged at 5.44 percent. One-Year C.D. at 6.17%\nYields on one-year and five-year C.D.'s were up one basis point, to 6.17 percent and 7.15 percent, respectively. The average yield for a two-and-a-half year C.D. was up two basis points, to 6.61 percent.\nIn the funds market this week, Donoghue's Money Fund Report said, the seven-day taxable, compounded average yield for money market mutual funds increased by 10 basis points, to 5.63 percent, while the 30-day compounded average yield rose 6 basis points, to 5.48 percent. Analysts said the rise in yields may not last more than a week or two, at the most.\nThe average maturity of securities held by the money market funds fell to 48 days, from 50 days, as portfolio managers apparently shortened maturities to take advantage of the higher rates.\nCONSUMER RATES

Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., acquired its Esquire Health and Fitness Clinic, which publishes a magazine-on-the-wall for health clubs. And the shareholders of the Esquire Magazine Group will continue to own the company's Esquire Press, its book publishing division, and Esquire Video.\nPhillip Moffitt, editor in chief and president of the Esquire group, said financial terms of the deals would not be made public. He said he would become an editorial consultant to both Hearst and American Express Publishing for an interim period.\nRumors that Hearst would buy Esquire magazine had been circulating for several weeks. But it had not been apparent that Mr. Moffitt would almost completely relinquish his involvement in the communications empire that he and his erstwhile partner, Christopher Whittle, had carved out in the last 10 years. Plans to Write\nIn a telephone interview, Mr. Moffitt said he had decided in November to sell the company to devote his efforts to writing full time.\n''I've always wanted to write full time,'' he said. ''I felt that I had achieved almost every goal I had set for myself in magazine publishing, but this other thing so nagged at me that it finally reached the point where I said to myself that if I was ever to give myself over to it, I had to do it now.''\nMr. Moffitt said the Esquire group had been pursued for years, but that the sale was expedited to beat the new tax law that takes effect today. All the transactions took effect as of yesterday.\nAll 150 of the Esquire group's employees will continue to work at the New York offices and at regional sales offices in Chicago, Detroit, Chicago and Los Angeles under the new managements. Wilma Jordan, the Esquire group's chief operating officer, will be a consultant to Hearst on Esquire for the next three months. 'Bonus Pool' Set Up\nMr. Moffitt said that the corporation's selling shareholders, with their profits from the transactions, had established a ''bonus pool'' of more than $1 million for distribution to all employees who are not shareholders.\n''It's just to say thanks for having made Esquire a high-spirited, fun place to work,'' Mr. Moffitt said.\nIndustry analysts noted that Hearst owns several magazines oriented toward male readers, including Popular Mechanics, Boating and Sports Afield, although most of its magazines, including Town & Country, Cosmopolitan and Harper's Bazaar, are aimed at women.\nSeventy percent of Esquire's readers are men, mainly between the ages of 25 and 44. But the magazine has been seeking a slightly older audience. Ad Pages Decline\nEsquire estimates that it will carry 1,300 pages of advertising this year, down 7 percent from last year. It has a circulation of 700,000.\nEsquire was originally owned by the 13-30 Corporation, then headed by Mr. Moffitt and Mr. Whittle. But they split up last April and divided their assets into two separate corporations: Whittle Communications and the Esquire Magazines Group Inc.\nWhittle Communications has 25 media properties, including single-sponsor publications, newsletters, and ''magazines-on-the-wall,'' which consist of small-scale billboards in schools and offices that are frequently changed.\nThomas O. Ryder, president of American Express Publishing, said the purchase of New York Woman fits the company's intention to reach more affluent women in urban areas, which is the publication's target readership.\nIn a separate industry development, Playboy Enterprises Inc. announced that it had sold its Games magazine, which offers puzzles and mind benders, to an investor group that includes the publication's publisher. Jerry Calabrese, Hershel Sarbin, former president of the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, and Victor H. Palmieri, the financier.

Nearby, a saleswoman battered apart blocks of frozen geese with an ax.\nJust as Americans know an election is approaching when city services suddenly become more courteous and efficient, so Muscovites sensed that something was afoot. 'Initiative' Is the Byword\nSure enough, the official press explained, Moscow was witnessing a splendid demonstration of the newest Soviet economic slogan, ''initiative.''\nThe three-day glut was organized under a Government decree, issued earlier this year, that allows collective farms to take a part of their produce to market on their own and sell it for whatever prices the traffic will bear.\nNormally, the average Soviet grocery shopper has two choices. He can buy from the Government shops, where goods are sold at low, fixed prices but where the selection, at least in the dead of winter, is meager.\nOr he can buy from the collective farmers who offer a greater variety of food grown on their private plots adjoining the collective farms where they work. The farmers often have meats, homemade pickles, and enticing fruit, but at stiff prices. Motivating the Farmer\nThe new directive was designed to give farmers an incentive to get more fruit and vegetables to market from the collective farms themselves -items that might normally rot on the farm because of the Government's inadequate distribution system.\nUnder the new policy, the collective farms are allowed to sell 30 percent of their produce at whatever prices the traffic will bear, and to keep the proceeds for projects on the farm.\nGetting the additional groceries to the cities, the Government reasons, will shorten lines at Government stores, and provide some competition to drive down the farmers' prices.\nMoscow tested the system in the fall, in food fairs set up before the Revolution Day holiday on Nov. 7. The event was proclaimed a success, and the fairs were reopened for three days last weekend on a grander scale.\nMuscovites are also finding it a little easier to fill their glasses this season for holiday toasts.\nLiquor stores, their hours curtailed as part of the campaign against drunkenness, now stay open an hour later, and Sunday hours have been resumed.\nFor those who can do without wine or vodka, Moscow is awash in champagne. Even as the Government was reporting last week that vodka and wine sales had been curtailed by higher prices and shorter hours, sales of sparkling wine, both Hungarian imports and the sweetish bubbly from domestic factories, have remained constant, 212 million bottles in the first 11 months of 1986.\nRecently the Government began permitting sales of sparkling wine in grocery stores and fruit juice bars.\n''Initiative'' has so far not brought even temporary relief to other consumer items, judging by the grumpy crowds lined up to buy New Year's gifts in department stores.\nAt Detsky Mir, the children's department store, aisles were congested and the mood was anything but festive.\nThe wait for toy trains appeared to be at least two hours, not counting a separate trip to the cashier to pay for it, and a return to claim the purchase.\nIn the cavernous Victorian halls of the GUM department store, by far the biggest draw was a newly arrived supply of blank Sony cassettes. The line snaked 100 yards through the store to purchase the cassettes at $13.50 apiece.\nThe Soviet Union is second in the world in electricity production, but it seems to invest little of that in lighting. This is a city of 60-watt bulbs, dimly lit streets, and drivers who refuse to use their headlights.\nThe New Year's holiday is a glorious exception.\nFlickering colored lights are affixed to lampposts in the shapes of torches or snowflakes, buildings are outlined in yellow lights, and one of the electronic billboards normally devoted to political slogans now portrays a figure suspiciously like Santa Claus.\nNot really Santa Claus, of course. During the first 20 years after the 1917 Revolution, the observance of Christmas was abolished, but many of the trappings were transferred to the New Year's holiday.\nThus Grandfather Frost, a jolly old soul in a red suit and white beard, somewhat more slender than the American Santa Claus, brings gifts for children on New Year's Eve. Store windows are festooned with tinsel and cardboard snowmen, and New Year's trees are trimmed with plastic balls and edible ornaments.\nNear Red Square, giant fir trees have been strung with colored lights and tinsel, and topped with a red star that is clearly not intended to represent Bethlehem's.\nMOSCOW JOURNAL

The action was in response to a request from the Bankers Trust New York Corporation and J. P. Morgan & Company to interpret existing New York State law.\nAlthough the department's interpretation left a number of questions, it nonetheless gave state-chartered banks - such as the Bankers Trust Company and the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, which are the bank subsidiaries of the Bankers Trust and J. P. Morgan holding companies - far broader securities powers than they have previously enjoyed. And it set the stage for a regulatory tug-of-war between the State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Board. Glass-Steagall Act\nIn interpreting the Glass-Steagall Act, a Federal law that separates commercial banking from securities underwriting, the Fed has essentially forbidden banks to underwrite most securities. Yet both the State Banking Department and the Fed claim jurisdiction over Bankers Trust and J. P. Morgan. The Fed regulates the subsidiaries of bank holding companies; the State Banking Department claims authority over banks chartered in New York.\nAt the Fed, Joseph Coyne, a spokesman, said lawyers had not received a copy of the state's interpretation and would have no comment.\nAccording to David Halvorson, the Banking Department's deputy superintendent, the department's board members could offer as early as their next meeting, next Thursday, ''prudential guidelines'' on how the securities subsidiaries of the state-chartered banks will have to operate.\nAlthough a regulatory clash seems likely, it is not certain.\nFor one thing, both Morgan and Bankers Trust have applied to the Fed to underwrite securities through subsidiaries of their holding companies as opposed to through subsidiaries of their banks. They may decide to defer establishing any underwriting units until the Fed issues a ruling.\nAdditionally, taking advantage of the loophole in New York would mean alienating Fed officials, something the banks might not want to do.\nA spokesman, John Morris, declined to say what Morgan's next step would be, other than to say that its lawyers were mapping strategy.\nGeorge Fasel, a Bankers Trust spokesman, said Bankers would probably wait until the Fed gave further guidance on banks' securities powers before setting up any securities operation in New York. FED SETS HEARING FOR BANKS\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (Special to The New York Times) - The Federal Reserve Board announced today that it had scheduled a public hearing on the requests by Citicorp, J. P. Morgan and Bankers Trust for authority to underwrite and issue commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, industrial revenue bonds and other consumer-related debt securities through wholly owned subsidiaries. A spokesman for the Fed said the rare public hearing before the Fed's board of governors would be held on Feb. 3, and on Feb. 5 if a second day was necessary.

Wilutis, the chief prosecutor for the Suffolk County District Attorney's office, charged that the suspect, Anthony Romeo of Locust Valley, L.I., ''has committed the crime of murder and that his revolver was the murder weapon.'' No motive was cited in the court papers.\nMr. Romeo has so far not been arrested or formally indicted. His lawyer, Steven Scaring, has instructed him not to speak about the case.\nMr. Scaring said today that his client had ''absolutely'' no involvement in the murder. Hair Samples Sought\nThe prosecutor, Mr. Wilutis, asked the court to order Mr. Romeo to provide samples of his hair and blood for examination by police laboratory investigators. Mr. Starkey was found ''clutching 12 brown head hairs,'' the roots of which showed traces of blood, according to Mr. Wilutis.\nAn affidavit filed by a homicide detective, Sgt. Robert Misegades, said it was ''reasonable to assume'' that Mr. Starkey ''grabbed the hair of the person who shot him or someone else within arm's reach of him just before, during or immediately after he was shot.''\nMr. Wilutis told the court that if laboratory analysis of Mr. Romeo's hair and blood matched that caught in Mr. Starkey's grip, it would indicate that he had been present during the murder.\nMr. Scaring has told the police they should have ''no further contact whatsoever'' with his client and he said today that he would probably oppose the motion requesting hair and blood samples.\nA County Court judge is to issue a decision on Jan. 12. Fired at Close Range\nAccording to the affidavit submitted by Sergeant Misegades, Mr. Starkey was killed by four .38-caliber bullets fired at close range.\nMr. Romeo possessed a pistol permit for a .357-Magnum Smith & Wesson revolver, which is capable of firing .38-caliber bullets, Mr. Wilutis said.\n''Microscopic examination and comparison'' of that revolver revealed that the bullets that caused Mr. Starkey's death ''were fired from Romeo's revolver,'' he added. Tests by police laboratory technicians also found traces of Mr. Starkey's blood under the grip of the weapon, he said.\nThe police came into possession of the revolver last July 31, when Mr. Romeo's father, Ronald, surrendered it to Nassau police officials, explaining that he ''did not believe that Anthony had the emotional capacity to have guns around the house,'' Mr. Wilutis told the court.\nWhen told of these charges, Mr. Scaring said: ''Why has it taken them so many months to come up with these results? Ballistics tests don't take that long.''\nThe Starkey killing profoundly shocked Saltaire, the summer home of many wealthy and well-known people. Mr. Starkey's father, Richard J. Starkey, is a friend and former aide to Governor Cuomo. A Buried Deer\nSeveral aspects of the case remain unexplained.\nFor example, 10 days after the discovery of Mr. Starkey's body, a deer was found buried behind a neighbor's house. The bullets that killed the deer also came from Mr. Romeo's gun, the police now charge, but why the deer might have been killed was unclear. Based on testimony from a neighbor who heard shots fired, the police believe the deer was slain on Oct. 30 or 31.\nAccording to affidavits filed by Mr. Wilutis and Sergeant Misegades, Mr. Romeo has given conflicting testimony about his whereabouts at the time of the murder.\nIn the days just before the body was discovered, Mr. Starkey's mother, Elizabeth, telephoned Mr. Romeo to ask whether he had seen her son, according to the court documents. At first, Mr. Romeo denied that he had seen him. Later, however, he said he had been with Mr. Starkey on Fire Island, the documents state.\nMr. Romeo told detectives that he visited Fire Island in October and November, but contended that his guns had been safely locked away in Locust Valley then.\nMr. Scaring said his client ''was not on Fire Island at the time of the murder, which the lawyer said ''took place at least two days after he left.''\nMr. Romeo is 22 or 23 years old and ''employed, though I don't know in exactly what capacity,'' Mr. Scaring said. ''He lives with his parents.''

His interest in historic properties eventually led him to the board of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\nBeginning in the early 1960's, the partnership he managed, Sherburne Associates, bought up much of the rundown waterfront of the old whaling community on the chip of land 30 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean, then fixed it up, building by building, filling in the holes with 18th-century reproductions.\n''If we had taken this beautiful place and allowed the same kind of beachfront motels and pizza parlors that visitors could find on the mainland, there would have been no reason for them to come the 30 miles out here,'' Mr. Beinecke said yesterday.\nBut he was never interested in preservation of historic architecture for preservation's sake. He always intended to make a profit - even if it took him a couple of decades to do it. On Christmas Eve, he sold the holdings of the family partnership -160 buildings, including two hotels, the Nantucket Boat Basin, 36 retail buildings and 40 cottages.\nThe Beinecke partnership had accumulated the properties gradually, renovating them a few at a time. The partners took advantage of tax rules on depreciation and historic preservation to help shelter income from other businesses. ''In the early years, there was no way to justify the investment based on the returns the properties were generating,'' Mr. Beinecke said. ''But we assumed we were building capital value as the years wore on, and as the economy of the island began to revive.''\nThe revival came slowly. After a century as a whaling port, Nantucket fell into a 100-year depression after a fire burned the town in 1846, Mr. Beinecke said. Then, after World War II, tourists began to find their way to the remote island.\n''The question was whether to provide for it in a way that would save what was worth seeing in Nantucket, or just let the growth happen,'' he said.\nEven after his family had become the largest landholders on the island, Mr. Beinecke often found himself arguing before the local preservation organization for greater restrictions on development. He often contributed money to groups attempting to buy up vacant land to block development.\nSuch a strategy helped make existing properties - including the Beineckes' - more valuable, but it also tended to limit the freedom, and sometimes the income, of shopowners and developers.\nMr. Beinecke also used his control of the commercial real estate of the island to moderate the traffic. He refused to allow one ferry boat to land at his marina, the only one on the island, when the ferry operator declined to reduce the number of passengers he was bringing each day.\nRents in the shops on the rejuvenated piers soared tenfold, to $6,500 a month, but the customers came and the island's economy boomed.\nStill, as a real estate company, Sherburne was less than a runaway success. ''It was never a free-standing business,'' Mr. Beinecke said. ''Our principal business was Christmas Club A Corporation, which organized savings clubs for banks. We used the depreciation and other tax-related benefits to offset some of the profits from that business.''\nThe only way to realize the increased value of the properties was to sell them, but after playing such a large roll in the revival of the town's economy, the Beineckes were reluctant to let go. ''There was a strong element of family pride,'' Mr. Beinecke said. ''We wanted to find someone who would manage them with the same concern as we had for maintaining the standards of design and quality.''\nNot until November did First Winthrop learn that the properties might be available. The Beineckes had already gone to contract with another buyer, but then that deal fell through.\n''We were prepared to act quickly,'' said Jeffrey D. Furber, an assistant vice president at Winthrop Financial Associates, the umbrella partnership over First Winthrop. ''The Beineckes were eager to complete the sale before the tax rates went up at the end of the year, and we were already acquainted with the properties.''\nFirst Winthrop holds more than $5 billion of real estate around the country and employs 450 people.\nAmong the company's largest holdings are a group of 19 buildings in New York City purchased from the MacArthur Foundation of Chicago in 1984. Those buildings include the Gulf and Western building at Columbus Circle and commercial buildings on Fifth and Park Avenues.\nAfter meetings in Boston, New York and Nantucket between Mr. Beinecke and Arthur Halleran Jr., chairman of First Winthrop, the deal was sealed. ''Mr. Beinecke was looking for a buyer who would hold the properties as a group, not sell them off piece by piece to help pay for the acquisition,'' Mr. Furber said. ''That fit our strategy perfectly. Our view is that if you buy and hold real estate that cannot be duplicated, you will eventually make money.''\nBuying and holding worked for the Beineckes. Said Mr. Beinecke, ''Whether by the grace of God or inflation, we managed to make a profit in the end.'' TALKING DEALS

F.A.O. Schwarz Jr., a partner in a large law firm, was already deep in public interest litigation, suing the Census Bureau on the city's behalf. It was easy for Mr. Schwarz to apply his impressive energy full time to the city's top legal job. He now returns to private practice, having earned the gratitude of New Yorkers for five years of distinguished service as the city's chief lawyer.\nThat Census lawsuit, still pending, is characteristically creative. It challenges the loss of Federal aid based on a Census known to have undercounted urban minorities. Since taking office, Mr. Schwarz has pressed the Reagan Administration to account for its illegal cuts in disability benefits for New Yorkers on Social Security, an initiative that brought a resounding 9-to-0 Supreme Court victory last year. His aggressive litigation program attracted many bright young lawyers who accepted low wages for the privilege of working with him.\nMr. Schwarz met the challenges of his office from potholes to human rights. He worked for fair ways to ease the city's liability for citizen injuries and sought more consistent tax policy toward charitable organizations. He defended hiring programs for minorities and victims of bias against homosexuals, sometimes winning in the Legislature what he couldn't win in court. At a time of widespread panic over acquired immune deficiency syndrome, he helped design and courageously defended in court a sound, humanitarian policy of including AIDS victims in city classrooms.\nPossibly Mr. Schwarz's best work came in response to the city corruption disclosures of the last year. He saw them as an opportunity to reform a sick political system. While guiding change in city contracting procedures, he kept hammering away at uncontrolled political giving, loose ethics and lobbying laws, the appearance of political favoritism. The City Council could now give proper recognition to his service by enacting his proposal to deny discretionary benefits to anyone who contributes more than $3,000 to city officials.\nFritz Schwarz, great-grandson of the toy company founder, served the nation well a decade ago as counsel to the Senate committee investigating intelligence abuses. In New York, he has raised aspirations and performance in city government and made City Hall cleaner and livelier. It's a contribution to be prized, for its content and for its example.

It reached an all-time peak of 1,955.57 on Dec. 2, when it soared 43.03 points, the third-largest gain in the indicator's history.\nYesterdy was another story, with the Dow falling 12.66 points, to slip below 1,900, at 1,895.95.\nThat was the lowest point since Nov. 21, when it stood at 1,893.56.\nAnalysts attributed yesterday's disappointing performance to tax-related selling and continued worries about the economy.\n''There was a lot of tax-selling, the little folks who waited until the last minute to take their capital gains,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, an analyst at the A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. securities firm in St. Louis.\nUnder new tax regulations that take effect today, capital gains will be taxed at higher rates than under the current law. Dollar Continues to Fall\nMeanwhile, the dollar continued to fall sharply on world currency markets, encouraging fears of resurgent inflation and concern that the Federal Reserve would not be lowering interest rates soon.\n''Nineteen eighty-six started with a bang,'' said Gene Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal Inc. ''A rise from the January low of 1,491 to the March 1,850 high - a 24 percent straight line advance - was the best gain of the year, before the market's momentum stalled with April's Libya bombing.''\nMr. Seagle said the market kept within a basic trading range between 1,740 and 1,920 as it was buffeted by the Levine and Boesky affairs along with the Reagan Adminsitration's Iranian and Nicaraguan crises. He said that the 14 percent rally by the Dow from September to December lifted it to a new intra-day high of 1,970, exceeding the 1,955.57 record for a day's close.\nAnalysts said that 1987, with the new tax program and the addition to option buying and selling negated the usual year-end upswing, which was reflected in yesterday's pre-holiday weakness.\nThey added that there was some reason for optimism next year. ''Nineteen eighty-seven looks like a big year for the bulls,'' Mr. Seagle said. ''It should be remembered that the third year of any Administration has not been a 'downer' since 1939.''\n''The year's high point of the program-trading phenomenon on the stock market was reflected in the 86.61-point drop on the Dow on Sept. 11,'' Mr. Seagle said. ''Buy and sell programs have brought instability and insecurtiy to the marketplace.''\nDeclines on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday led advances by 842 to 799 as volume rose to 139.2 million shares, from 126.2 million shares on Tuesday. Broader-Based Indicators\nBroader-based indicators than the Dow showed fractional drops. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.20 points, to 242.17, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index edged down 0.54, to 138.58.\nAmong individual issues, BellSouth led the New York Stock Exchange most-active list, down 3/8, to 57 3/4, on a volume of more than 6.4 million shares. Most other issues among the actives showed only fractional gains or losses.\nBigger point decliners among the blue chips were Merck, which fell 2 1/4, to 123 7/8; General Motors H, which fell 2 1/8, to 38 5/8; Digital Equipment, which fell 1 3/8, to 104 3/4, and G.E., which lost a point, to 86.\nIn economic news, New York gold futures for February delivery jumped $14.50 to end at $406.90 an ounce. The action in gold also reflected the revival of inflation concerns with the jump in oil prices. Also, spot February crude oil climbed 29 cents a barrel, to $17.94, and spot trading reached as high as $18 for the first time in 11 months.\nIn response to the move in gold prices, shares of mining companies advanced across the board. ASA Ltd. rose 2, to 37 1/2; Dome Mines 3/8, to 7 3/4; Homestake Mining 1 3/8, to 25 3/8; Newmont Mining 1 3/4, to 61 1/2, and Campbell Red Lake 1, to 19 5/8.\nPrices were higher on the American Stock Exchange. The Amex market value index managed a 1.73-point gain, to 263.27, as advances rebounded to overtake declines by 395 to 274.\nIn over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.51, to 348.83.

Michael Julian, a police spokesman.\nThe robbers - the police said there were four - took cash, credit cards and jewelry from the the 16 people in the bar and $1,500 from the cash register. They fled in a car. Two Suspects Captured\nTwo suspects were caught an hour later when the police tracked down a license plate on the double-parked getaway car, but two other suspects remained at large, said Police Officer Peter O'Donnell, another spokesman.\nCaptain Julian said there were ''indications some tactical errors were made in the officers' approach to the bar'' that could ''lead to retraining and possibly a reprimand.''\nBoth officers kept their pistols in their holsters as they walked toward the bar, Captain Julian said. He added that he did not know whether they believed the robbers had already fled.\nThe officers were identified as Frank Lello, 25 years old, who joined the force in July 1983, and Silvia Pacheco, 23, who joined in January 1985. They were treated at St. John's Hospital for shock and released. No injuries to patrons were reported.\nCaptain Julian said the police could not provide statistics on the number of incidents in which officers had lost their guns to assailants. ''It's not the first time, but it is rare,'' he said.\nSuch incidents are thoroughly reviewed, and many are used as a basis for officer training sessions on how to avoid them, he added. Transit Officer Helps\nThe robbery occurred at 1:15 A.M. at the Greenpoint Tavern, 188 Bedford Avenue in the Greenpoint section.\nThe two suspects were quickly arrested because an off-duty transit police officer, initially unaware of the robbery but walking nearby, wrote down the getaway car's license plate number after hearing its driver shout ''Did you get the guns?'' before speeding off.\nThe police used the information to trace the car to the home of one of the suspects, Martin Allen, 36, of 270 Crown Street in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. The car was registered to his wife, the police said. The second suspect in custody was identified as James Radden, 33, of 829 Beverly Road in the Flatbush section,

Truman on. ''And I think it will stretch into 1987,'' he said.\nThis is a city with its own rhythm, much given to the stately pause - the Congressional recess, for example, or the Presidential vacation. But in recent months, as Mr. Clifford suggests, the capital's rhythm has quickened. And as 1986 tumbled toward 1987, seasoned Washingtonians had the sense that history was moving fast.\nThe holidays seemed truncated, perhaps because the weeks leading up to them were filled with news of Congressional hearings on the Reagan Administration's secret arms sales to Iran and the appointment of a special prosecutor. And as the capital looked ahead, the new year seemed likely, to many, to maintain the old year's dizzying pace.\nIn the first week of 1987, President Reagan will have prostate surgery. The 100th Congress will convene, with Democrats in control of both houses and with one of the first items of business the formal start-up of two special committees named to investigate the Iran arms deal.\nBoth national party chairmen predict that the 1988 Presidential campaign will soon begin to escalate. The Republicans will choose a convention site in January, the Democrats not long afterward. The Republican chairman, Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., said it seemed he had just finished wrapping up the 1984 convention in Dallas.\nThere is, indeed, a breathless quality to it all. But Washingtonians still found a little time on New Year's Eve to take stock, to look back and ahead, to voice a few resolutions, predictions and dreams.\nMr. Fahrenkopf took heart this week when he scanned the front page of a major newspaper and discovered not a single article on Iran. He is hopeful, albeit cautiously so, that the uproar may have reached its peak. ''Unless there's something we don't know about, I don't think it will be as high a profile,'' the party chairman said as he looked ahead to 1987.\nThe past few months have been difficult for the Republicans. First they lost control of the Senate, then they watched Mr. Reagan become mired in controversy over the Iran arms deal and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. ''We didn't even get a chance to catch our breath after the election and the Iran thing hit,'' Mr. Fahrenkopf said. ''And that was like a snowball going downhill, it went so fast.''\nMr. Fahrenkopf's New Year's resolution is to pick up two more governorships in 1987, which would give the Republicans a majority of the governors' seats. He dismisses, out of hand, the notion that the ''Reagan era'' is ending, as many Democrats have euphorically declared. ''So long as he's in that White House, he will never be a lame duck, in my view,'' Mr. Fahrenkopf said. ''He'll always be a tremendous force.''\nOver the holidays, the Republican chairman said he went into his office and read some of the mail from party loyalists around the country. It was mostly Christmas cards - ''give our best to the President and First Lady'' - and Mr. Fahrenkopf said it was a wonderful lift to his mood. He did, indeed, sound enthusiastic as he viewed the approaching year.\nOn Capitol Hill, the end of the old year and the dawn of the new were being marked by that ancient ritual of legislative bodies: the shuffling of office space.\nPerhaps one of the most evocative signs of change on Capitol Hill occurred when the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., who is retiring after three decades in Congress, moved out of his offices this month. ''He's going to be greatly missed,'' said Paul G. Kirk Jr., chairman of the Democratic National Committee.\nA flurry of other moving has been going on, what with the retiring and the defeated, the returning and the new, and much shuffling of staff.\nOne of the hottest jobs of the new year will be on the staff of the special committees formed to conduct the Iran-Nicaragua investigations. ''We have received lots of applications, and I mean lots,'' said a spokesman for Senator Daniel K. Inouye, who will head the Senate panel.\nMr. Kirk was closing out 1986 in good spirits. He was not complacent - Democratic leaders warn constantly of the danger of complacency regarding the Republicans' troubles over the Iran affair - but he was certainly in a confident frame of mind.\n''I thought it would be a year of reckoning for the Republicans,'' the Democratic chairman said as he looked back on 1986.\nAfter his party's landslide Presidential defeat in 1984, ''It was kind of fashionable to beat up on the Democrats,'' Mr. Kirk said.\nHe believes that in 1986, the Democratic Party regained its psychological edge and shattered the thesis that the electorate was undergoing a fundamental change in party allegiance.\n''I never really bought into the so-called realignment,'' the party chairman said.\nIn 1987, Mr. Kirk argues, the Democrats will have a great opportunity: to focus on the future, while the Republicans must defend the past, including the Iran controversy. He looked toward 1987 with the buoyance common among Democrats since the returns were tallied on Nov. 4.\nWASHINGTON TALK

Nixon and that the following year it carried the likeness of a key figure in the undoing of his Presidency, Judge John J. Sirica. Pope John appeared in 1962, the first year of Vatican II, which brought sweeping change to the Roman Catholic Church.

And several of his key teammates are also playing with injuries.\n''My arm's always stiff,'' Ryan said stoically. ''I get used to it.''\nRyan has had a chronic arm problem since 1984, when he started the first 11 games despite the injury. He began taking a day off once a week, a practice he has continued since.\n''I was in a lot worse shape in '84 than I am now,'' he said.\nStill, the Jets are ''not playing with a full deck,'' in the words of Coach Joe Walton.\nThe injured regulars include Marty Lyons, the defensive lineman who was sidelined late in the season with a shoulder injury. Now, both shoulders are bothering him.\n''Marty's been able to help us to a certain point in the game,'' Walton concedes.\n''I try not to take anything for the pain,'' says Lyons. ''You go on emotion and adrenaline, and when it gets to the point it's unbearable, you take yourself out.'' He was forced to take himself out against the Chiefs last Sunday.\nMark Gastineau has played just one game since returning from knee surgery; Ken O'Brien has a sprained right pinky that could limit him if he had to replace Ryan; the right tackle, Gordon King, and the left guard, Guy Bingham, are playing because the regulars are injured; Johnny Hector has not been on the field for three games because of a hamstring problem, leaving all the halfback duties to Freeman McNeil; Tom Baldwin is still at nose tackle for the sidelined Joe Klecko; Lance Mehl's surgery rushed Rusty Guilbeau's return to linebacker even though his knee rehabilitation wasn't complete.\n''But,'' asks Lyons, ''tell me who's a healthy team now?''\nResults against common opponents don't mean much because football often is a game of matchups. But, anyway, here are the Jets' and Browns' scores against common foes:\nBuffalo - The Jets beat the Bills twice, 28-24 and 14-13; Cleveland beat them, 21-17.\nCincinnati - The Jets lost, 52-21; Cleveland split, losing, 30-13, and winning, 34-3.\nPittsburgh - The Jets lost by 45-24; Cleveland swept the Steelers, 27-24 and 37-31.\nKansas City - The Jets beat them in the wild-card game, 35-15; Cleveland beat them, 20-7.\nIndianapolis - A Jet sweep, 26-7 and 31-16; Cleveland won by 24-9.\nMiami - A Jet split, a 51-45 victory in overtime and a 45-3 thrashing; Cleveland beat them, 26-16.\nThe record shows the Browns were 7-1 against these teams while the Jets had a 6-3 mark against them.\nThe Jets have played in a Super Bowl and they have been to the American Conference championship game. But when they play the Browns they will be performing in their 18th game of the season - the most they have ever played. That A.F.C. championship season? That was 1982 - the strike season when they played only nine regular-season games. The Super Bowl season was only 14 regular-season games long. They had only one playoff game - a victory over the Raiders - before the Super Bowl.\nThe Jets' 37-10 victory over the Browns last season broke a six-year stretch between the teams in which no game was decided by more than 4 points. Two went into overtime (won by the Browns on field goals), another two were captured in regulation time by Cleveland on field goals and the Jets took one game by a missed extra point.\nThe kicking may be a factor Saturday. Five Cleveland Stadium games this season have been decided by field goals, with the Browns winning four.\n''It's a hard stadium to kick in,'' says Pat Leahy of the Jets. ''It's open and cold, but I've had some decent games in there.''\nMatt Bahr, the Browns' kicker, was injured on a tackle after a kickoff. Mark Moseley, cut by the Redskins, replaced him and has been fair, kicking 12 of 19. Leahy, though, is 16 for 19.\nJETS NOTEBOOK

I judge a coach by what he gets his guys to do. He gets them to do a lot. Being a good coach doesn't have anything to do with winning or losing. Unfortunately, you're judged by winning all the time. I don't think it was like that years ago.''\nOn why the Giants are practicing here for Sunday's playoff game here against the San Francisco 49ers, rather than moving to a southern training base as the Bears and the Cleveland Browns did: ''If you're going to play in the Atlantic, you're going to practice in the Atlantic. If we were going to play in a warm city, we probably would have gone there.''\nOn his weather preference for Sunday: ''The defensive guys would like a blizzard. The offensive guys would like 45 degrees and no wind. I've got to go on both sides. I'd like it to be snowing when they've got the ball and nice when we have it.''\nOn his key personnel move this year: ''If there was any one, it would be Raul Allegre. Getting a kicker like that made a definite difference, especially when it's 10 seconds to go and you win the game. We had a couple of those this year. You miss those and you have the hearses out.''\nOn which teams made the National Conference playoffs and which did not: ''I thought Minnesota was going to make it, not that they're better than the teams in it. In preseason, I thought Dallas, based on its track record, probably would be involved. And once Atlanta was 5-1, I thought they could make it if they played .500 the rest of the way.''\nOn the Giants' 21-point third quarter that beat the 49ers, 21-17, four weeks ago: ''We put together some big plays. I've seen the 49ers do that, too, like the second quarter of that game. Those guys moving the chains were getting tired.''\nThree 49ers are listed as questionable for Sunday's game - Michael Carter, the starting nose tackle, with an injured left ankle; John Ayers, a starting offensive guard, with an injured left knee, and Mike Durrette, a backup guard, with a lower-back problem. Jeff Stover, a starting defensive end, is listed as probable with an injured left ankle, and he and Carter will probably not play full time.\nAyers is an excellent pass blocker, and in past games between the Giants and the 49ers he often neutralized Taylor's pass rush. This time, Guy McIntyre, who blocks better against the run than the pass, will start for him.\nCarter and Stover are having seasons that would worry Blue Cross. Carter has endured, in succession, a concussion, a sprained left ankle, a sprained right ankle, a sprained right wrist and a reinjured left ankle. Stover's ailments have traveled from right knee to left shoulder to left ankle. However, Carter and Stover have missed only one game each.\nN.F.L. playoff games, like the heavyweight championship fights of old, attract celebrities. Andy Rooney, Telly Savalas and Walter Cronkite will have no problem seeing the Giants-49ers game because they own season tickets. Don Ameche, Shelley Winters, Postmaster General Robert Tisch and Senator Alfonse D'Amato telephoned the Giants to buy tickets and got them. Governor Cuomo, who has said the Buffalo Bills are New York's only pro football team, asked to buy four tickets and got them.\nSo far, the Giants have not received a call from Mayor Koch, who has said that if the Giants or the Jets win the Super Bowl they should have a parade in New Jersey, where they play, rather than up Broadway.\n''I don't think we will hear from him,'' said one Giant official.\nGIANTS NOTEBOOK
148	REAGAN TO PROPOSE A COMPROMISE ON SPENDING FOR WATER TREATMENT	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA153FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: President Reagan, in a dramatic shift aimed at compromise with a Congress already preparing to defy him on the issue, is doubling his proposal for Federal spending on water treatment facilities, Administration officials said today.\nPresident Reagan, in a dramatic shift aimed at compromise with a Congress already preparing to defy him on the issue, is doubling his proposal for Federal spending on water treatment facilities, Administration officials said today.\nThe President will propose that $12 billion be spent over eight years on Federal grants and loans under the Clean Water Act to help communities build sewage treatment facilities, Lee M. Thomas, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in confirming the reports of other sources. In his previous budget the President asked for $6 billion for the clean water program.\nCongress unanimously voted in October for legislation to provide $18 billion for sewage treatment facilities. But after Congress adjourned and could not attempt to override a regular veto, the President said he would not sign the bill. In announcing this pocket veto, Mr. Reagan said he was committed to the clean water law but added, ''Unfortunately, this bill so far exceeds acceptable levels of intended budgetry commitments that I must withhold my approval.'' Proposal Part of Budget\nHis new proposal will come Monday in his budget for the fiscal year 1988, which under the budget law is supposed to have a deficit of no more than $108 billion. But a factor that could make it more difficult to reach that target is new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office today that the cost of Government benefit programs was increasing much faster than had been expected. [ Page 8. ] The version of the water program Mr. Reagan will propose would reduce the spending level Congress approved without changing the substantive revisions in the law that were made.\nBecause the bill had been passed unanimously and had been strongly supported by business, labor, environmental and state and local government groups, most experts said that a written veto would have been easily overridden. They also said the same legislation would pass easily again in the 100th Congress. 'Strong Alternative' Is Seen\nThe Administration will now seek to have its own legislation introduced, providing what Mr. Thomas called a ''strong alternative'' to the bill Congress passed. ''The President was looking for a compromise, recognizing where Congress was coming from last year and where it is going this year,'' Mr. Thomas explained. Another Administration official, who did not want to be quoted by name, said that the President's proposal ''is a last-gasp effort to get some moderation in that terribly expensive water bill.''\nBut the new chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota, announced today that a clean water bill identical with the one passed last year would be the first bill introduced in the Senate as the 100th Congress begins. House to Act Quickly\nThe House is also scheduled to take up the same legislation as its first order of business. The bill may go to the floor of both chambers as early as the first week of the new session, according to staff aides on Capitol Hill.\nBy all accounts, the legislation continues to enjoy strong bipartisan support in both Houses; it already has 58 cosponsors in the Senate. ''We intend to push this bill through the Congress and back onto the President's desk as soon as possible,'' Senator Burdick, a Democrat, said today. ''If President Reagan chooses to veto this bill, as he did its predecessor, I will lead the effort to override the veto.''\nMr. Thomas said that the Administration's water bill would gradually eliminate the sewage treatment grants over eight years, as Congress wanted, instead of over four years as the President proposed last year.\nHe said that the proposed bill would give states more flexibility in deciding whether they wanted to use the Federal money for outright grants to municipalities or to set up loan programs, but otherwise it left last fall's Congressional legislation unchanged.\nAmong the new provisions added to the clean water law by Congress last October was a provision requiring controls on runoff from urban streets and farms, which are serious sources of water pollution not addressed by existing law. Another new program would have required special efforts to clean up concentrations of hazardous chemicals in bodies of water. The amendments passed by Congress would give new authority to the E.P.A. to prosecute and penalize violators of the law. Critic Says It's Too Late\nThe Clean Water Act, originally passed in 1971, was intended to prevent the discharge of pollutants into the nation's waterways and to make its rivers, lakes and streams ''swimmable and fishable.''\nMr. Thomas said he had not talked to members of Congress about the Administration proposal and did not know how it would be received. ''But this is a strong alternative and one that will fly on its merits,'' he said.\nDaniel Weiss, a Washington representative for the Sierra Club, a national environmental group, said that for the Administration to propose its own water legislation now was ''trying to close the barn door after the cows have gone.'' A year ago, he said, a compromise effort might have had a chance.\n''But this is too little and too late,'' he contended.
149	GORBACHEV TELLS SOVIET ON NEW YEAR A THREAT OF WAR PERSISTS	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DA153FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: As Mikhail S. Gorbachev delivered a televised New Year's address to the Soviet Union, President Reagan's radio speech could be heard over the Voice of America early today on short-wave radios in spite of some jamming.\nAs Mikhail S. Gorbachev delivered a televised New Year's address to the Soviet Union, President Reagan's radio speech could be heard over the Voice of America early today on short-wave radios in spite of some jamming.\nAccording to American diplomats who monitored Mr. Reagan's broadcast here, it was audible on most of the frequencies used by Russian-language broadcasts of the Voice of America. One diplomat said that on at least two frequencies the broadcast could be easily understood. On other frequencies, the speech was drowned by static.\nListeners in Leningrad reportedly received the President's message clearly.\nMr. Reagan decided to beam his message to the Soviet Union by radio over the Voice of America after the Soviet Union rejected a White House proposal for an exchange of televised New Year's messages between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev.\nSoviet spokesmen said such an exchange would be inappropriate in light of what they described as a poor state of relations between the two countries, notably over the issue of arms control.\nLast year Mr. Reagan appeared on Soviet television, and Mr. Gorbachev spoke on television in the United States.\nIn his speech today, Mr. Reagan painted an optimistic picture of progress on arms control and other aspects of Soviet-American relations.\nIn contrast, Mr. Gorbachev, in a message to the American people handed to Joseph Kingsbury-Smith, national editor of the Hearst Newspapers, expressed disappointment over the arms control negotiations. Mr. Gorbachev said:\n''People in Washington should finally decide in utter clarity what they want: a runaway arms race or a reduction and elimination of weapons.''\nIn his New Year's speech to the Soviet people, Mr. Gorbachev said:\n''Good wishes alone are now not enough. Good deeds are also needed. Never before has the earth, our home, been subjected to such a danger. There are too many stockpiled weapons in it. These stockpiles should not be allowed to grow further, a catastrophe should not be allowed to happen.'' Deadlock on Arms Control Arms control talks in Geneva have been deadlocked since Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev agreed informally in Iceland in October on a 50 percent cut in all strategic nuclear forces over the next five years and on drastic reductions of Soviet and American medium-range missiles in Europe.\nA formal agreement in Iceland collapsed because the two men could not agree on a formula for limiting the development of space-based missile defenses.\nIn the New Year's speech to the Soviet people today, Mr. Gorbachev also criticized the American refusal to join the Soviet Union in a halt of nuclear testing and the American decision to stop adhering informally to the strategic arms limitation treaty of 1979.\n''Deliberately and pointedly wrecking old treaties does not help the conduct of successful talks on new agreements,'' Mr. Gorbachev said.\nMost of his speech was devoted to what he called an encouraging start on efforts to revitalize the economy.\nHe said the prospects engendered by the Iceland summit meeting had been set back by ''old conservative thinking'' by Western politicians.\nOn domestic matters, he said the Soviet Union had ''laid the beginning for a comprehensive renewal of our society'' through greater openness in the press and in the arts as well as through economic change.\nBut he warned that ''the forces of stagnation and complacency are still making themselves felt, some people still hope that everything will return to the old beaten track.'' ----Citizens Have Exchange In a live, four-hour radio program broadcast yesterday by radio stations in the United States and the Soviet Union, citizens of the two nations wished one another ''Happy New Year'' and the Russian equivalent, ''S novym godom.''\nThe program made no mention of the Soviet Union's rejection of an exchange of televised New Year's greetings between President Reagan and the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.\nPoets, children, singers, and classical, jazz and rock musicians from both countries performed and chatted. At one point, two cooks in New York and Moscow swapped recipes for New Year's specialties.\nThe program was broadcast in New York over WBAI radio starting at 7 A.M. and over the Soviet radio network at 3 P.M. Moscow time. It included live broadcasts from other cities in both countries.\nThe program, a joint production of the two radio stations, was part of a peace vigil that began worldwide at noon Greenwich time in London (7 A.M. Eastern Standard time).

151	U.S. TRADE DEFICIT HITS $19.2 BILLION, A MONTHLY RECORD	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D8153FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The nation's trade deficit soared to a record $19.2 billion in November, a startling setback following three months of improvement, the Commerce Department reported today.\nThe nation's trade deficit soared to a record $19.2 billion in November, a startling setback following three months of improvement, the Commerce Department reported today.\nThe gloomy figures put the United States on track for an estimated 1986 trade deficit of $173.6 billion, which would be $25 billion more than 1985's record shortfall.\nSpecial factors, including a small fee imposed Dec. 1 on most imported goods and rising calls for protectionist legislation, were responsible for a significant portion of the deterioration, as exporting countries and American importers accelerated the shipment of goods to this country.\nPrivate analysts expressed keen disappointment with the November figures, which Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's top economist, termed ''horrendous.'' Data 'Raise Questions'\nThe latest data ''raise questions about whether the trade accounts have turned around, as seemed to be the case by earlier figures,'' Stuart A. Schweitzer, a vice president at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said.\nThe figures also prompted predictions that Congress, with both chambers about to be controlled by the Democrats, would intensify its efforts to restrict imports.\nIn the currency markets, the Commerce Department report caused a selloff of the dollar, sending it to new six-year lows against the West Germany mark and other European currencies. As the dollar became less attractive, gold lured many buyers in holiday-shortened trading, surging above $400 an ounce. [ Page 51. ] Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, the new majority leader, seized the occasion to declare: ''The Administration has pretended that we have no trade crisis and that our trade problems will take care of themselves. With today's news, the Administration should make a New Year's resolution to work with Congress to enact comprehensive trade and competitiveness legislation that will restore jobs and halt the erosion of our industrial base.'' Deficit With Japan Surges\nAmong the dispiriting figures in today's report was a 35 percent jump, to $6.74 billion, in the trade deficit with Japan, the biggest one-month excess of imports over exports ever recorded with any country. Meanwhile, the deficit with Western Europe nearly tripled, and that with the developing world jumped nearly 40 percent.\nThe bulk of the new deterioration in the American trade position last month was accounted for by a 20.5 percent jump in imports, to a record $37.8 billion.\n''It continues to be more attractive to import than to use U.S. goods and services,'' Steve H. Hanke, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, said. ''We haven't yet turned the corner.''\nLargely because of the dollar's decline against the Japanese yen, West German mark and other major currencies over the last two years, economists have predicted that the trade deficit was bound to improve, as imported goods became more costly to Americans and American goods became more attractively priced abroad. In October, when exports posted a hefty increase and growth of imports appeared to have subsided, many suggested that the long-awaited narrowing of the trade gap had finally begun. New Doubt\nBut today's report cast doubt on this. It also gave fresh ammunition to the argument that too little attention had been paid to the fact that the dollar has not fallen much, if at all, against the currencies of such major trading partners as Canada and Mexico, and such increasingly important Far East exporters as Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.\nAmerican exports, meanwhile, fell 3.8 percent, to a total of $18.6 billion. November thus was only the second month - the first was July - in which imports outpaced exports by a 2-to-1 ratio.\nThe November report also pushed the deficit for the first 11 months of the year to $159.1 billion, eclipsing 1985's record $148.5 billion.\nThe existence of several special factors in the November report, however, served to dispel at least some of the general gloom.\nAn important factor in spurring imports, it was widely agreed, was the imposition on Dec. 1 of a 22-cent-per-$100 levy on all imported goods, except those from the Caribbean.\nAnalysts also speculated that the increasing talk of protectionist legislation - fanned by the takeover of the Senate by the Democrats in the Nov. 4 elections - may have inspired efforts to import as much as possible before further possible restrictions.\nIt also seemed likely, analysts said, that the new 1986 tax law acted to raise imports in November. Imports of foreign automobiles, for example, climbed about $1 billion, as dealers apparently rebuilt inventories depleted when consumers rushed to buy new cars while they could still deduct sales taxes. Depreciation Schedules\nDeliveries of some business equipment were also thought to have been stepped up to take advantage of favorable depreciation schedules.\nImports of steel were also higher, according to Commerce Under Secretary Bruce Smart, because of a strike at the USX Corporation and because this was a final opportunity for foreigners to get in under 1986 quotas.\nMr. Smart said, moreover, that nearly 40 percent of the $7.2 billion increase in the November deficit reflected an exceptionally big ''catch-up'' in the processing of shipments actually made in preceding months.\nThe American bill for imported oil rose to $3 billion last month, from $2.7 billion in October, reflecting a 9.3 percent rise in volume and a per-barrel price increase of 19 cents.\nAgricultural commodities posted their fourth consecutive trade surplus, $484 million, after slipping into deficit earlier this year for the first time since the early 1970's.\nThe record deficit with Japan reflected a sharp increase in imports -to $8.7 billion, from $7.3 billion - and a decline in exports, to $1.99 billion, from $2.28 billion. $1.76 Billion With Taiwan The deficit with Taiwan, $1.76 billion, was larger than that with any European country, and the deficits with South Korea and Hong Kong, both just under $825 million, were bigger than any European country except West Germany.\nThe deficit with Canada soared to $2.8 billion last month, from $1.6 billion, the department reported.
152	U.S. AIDE DEFENDS DELAY ON IRAN-CONTRA FINDING	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD8153FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A senior Justice Department official said today that a document that is believed to have disclosed the first link between Iranian arms shipments and support for Nicaraguan rebels contained no obvious indication that a crime had been committed.\nA senior Justice Department official said today that a document that is believed to have disclosed the first link between Iranian arms shipments and support for Nicaraguan rebels contained no obvious indication that a crime had been committed.\nThe official, Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, said the document revealed nothing that ''jumped off the page that suggested a criminal violation.''\nHe said he discovered the document in late November, in a preliminary investigation of the Iran arms sale.\nAlthough declining to discuss its contents, Mr. Reynolds said in an interview that he and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d were ''surprised'' when they found the document and learned of a link between arms sales to Iran and support for the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras. 'A Leap of Faith'\nBut he said it was unfair ''to assume that because money went to the contras that there was a criminal violation - that would be a leap of faith.''\nMr. Reynolds's comments were significant because they appeared to explain why the Justice Department did not move more quickly to call the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the case. According to his account, there was no immediate need for the F.B.I. or criminal prosecutors because there was no clear sign of criminality.\nMr. Reynolds also offered an extended defense of the department's handling of the Iran inquiry.\n''I keep asking myself what it is we could have done differently,'' he said. ''I have yet to see where we misstepped.''\nAccording to the department, the F.B.I. was called into the case three days after Mr. Reynolds discovered the document in White House files. Legislators have criticized the department for the delay, saying it might have allowed White House aides time to destroy documents sensitive to the case. A Draft Directive\nAccording to Government officials, the document was a draft national security directive suggesting the need to raise $12 million for the contras from the Iran arms sale.\nThe author, the officials said, is believed to have been Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, a former National Security Council aide.\nThe Justice Department has said that it took three days to gather sufficient evidence, through interviews and a review of documents, to show that a criminal investigation was needed.\nMr. Reynolds, who oversees the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and is one of Mr. Meese's closest advisers, was part of a small team of lawyers who uncovered the diversion of the Iran payments during a fact-finding inquiry into the arms sale.\nAsked about reports that documents had been destroyed by Colonel North and other White House officials in late November, Mr. Reynolds said he had no knowledge that any material had been destroyed.\nIn the November investigation, the Justice Department team interviewed Colonel North and the former White House national security adviser, Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter.\nThe Justice Department has said that Mr. Reynolds found the critical document on Nov. 22, a Saturday. On the following Tuesday, the department's criminal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents were brought into the case.\nMr. Reynolds said it was appropriate not to involve the criminal prosecutors in the initial stages of the inquiry. 'Host of Investigatory Problems'\n''It was felt, and I think quite properly, that it would have been a mistake to have brought in criminal investigators at a time well before anybody had any inkling of any kind of criminal culpability,'' he said.\n''You've got a whole host of investigatory problems that attach once you launch a criminal investigation,'' he said. ''Certain things have to be done in particular ways. Certain people have to be approached in particlar ways.''\n''I would venture to guess that if we had undertaken to launch a criminal investigation then, which I think would have been very premature, we would never have collected the kind of information we were able to gather by an informal fact-gathering activity,'' Mr. Reynolds said.\nHe said the Chief of the Criminal Division, William Weld, and Mr. Weld's supervisor, Associate Attorney General Stephen S. Trott, had agreed with the handling of the case. INQUIRY ON CONTRAS IS BEGUN\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (AP) -House investigators have begun another inquiry into allegations that Nicaraguan rebels and their United States supporters were involved in drug trafficking and gun-running, the head of a Congressional crime panel said today.\nMr. Hughes said his investigators, who have already done field work in Miami, were looking at ''allegations that have surfaced relative to narcotics trafficking and gun-running'' in Central America.

In between, the Cotton, the Sugar and the Rose Bowls will fill television screens across the nation. So, pull up a chair: FLORIDA CITRUS Auburn (9-2) vs. Southern Cal (7-4). Noon E.S.T., Orlando, Fla., ABC-TV. Southern California is the only one of the bowl teams that is not ranked among the Top 20. As a result, the Trojans are the underdogs against the nation's fourth-best scoring team. The Trojans will also be facing the second stingiest team in the country as Auburn gave up only 10.5 points a game, topped only by Oklahoma's 6.6 points per game.\nSouthern California has been noted for its distinguished running backs in the past, names like O. J. Simpson, Charles White and Marcus Allen. But this season's leading rusher for the Trojans is Ryan Knight with 550 yards.\nAs a result, this game will most likely be a match of a running Auburn team, led by Brent Fullwood, the nation's fourth-leading rusher, against the passing Trojans. Fullwood averaged 126 yards a game, while Rodney Peete, the quarterback for the Trojans, threw for 2,025 yards and 10 touchdowns. COTTON BOWL\nTexas A & M (9-2) vs. Ohio St. (9-3). 1:30 P.M. E.S.T., Dallas, CBS-TV.\nOhio State makes the Big Ten Conference's debut in the Cotton Bowl, while Texas A & M seeks to become only the second school in the bowl's history to win it in consecutive years. The eighth-ranked Aggies, who defeated Auburn, 36-16, last New Year's Day, want to match Texas's back-to-back Cotton Bowl championships in 1969-1970.\nThis may be a better Texas A & M team than the one that defeated Auburn last year. Coach Jackie Sherrill, who turned things around for the Aggies in five seasons, has the third-best offensive and the fourth-best defensive team in the nation. Only Oklahoma, first in total defense and second in total offense, has a better combination.\nCoach Earle Bruce of the Buckeyes is the subject of speculation each year that he is in his last season with the team, but Bruce has led the Buckeyes to a bowl game in each of his eight seasons as coach. They have gone to nine different Bowl games in the last 11 years. They lost to Alabama and Washington to start the season and fell to Michigan in the last game. SUGAR BOWL\nL.S.U. (9-2) vs. Nebraska (9-2). 3:30 P.M. E.S.T., New Orleans, ABC-TV.\nThe two teams will meet for the second time in three years in the Sugar Bowl, with Nebraska winning in 1985. This will mark the end of Bill Arnsparger's short coaching career at L.S.U. as he leavs to become athletic director at Florida.\nLouisiana State has a fair running attack, but the Tigers will be going against the second-best defensive team in the nation. Danny Noonan, the all-America middle guard from Nebraska, is the player L.S.U. must prevent from causing havoc in its backfield. With Tom Hogson, a red-shirted freshman, throwing, Wendell Davis, a junior split end, is the primary offensive threat for the Tigers. Hogson threw for 2,261 yards and 19 touchdowns, with Davis catching 80 passes for 1,244 yards and 11 touchdowns.\nCoach Tom Osborne of Nebraska has, as always, a fine I-back, or tailback, in Keith Jones, who gained 830 yards during the season. Steve Taylor has also become a solid quarterback for the Cornhuskers. He passed for 808 yards and ran for another 537, accounting for 15 touchdowns. ORANGE BOWL\nOklahoma (10-1) vs. Arkansas (9-2). 8:30 P.M. E.S.T., Miami, NBC-TV.\nThe declaration that Brian Bosworth, the all-America linebacker from Oklahoma, could not play because he tested positive for steroid use created the most publicity and also diminished Oklahoma's position as the heavy favorite. Bosworth's loss has put a lot of pressure on his replacement, Dante Jones.\n''If I miss a tackle or something, I know some people will be saying Brian would have made that one, '' Jones said. ''I guess it's good in a way, though. It'll make me play harder.''\nArkansas also lost a starting linebacker, David Dudley, because of steroids, thus putting each team minus a key player in their most important game of the season. Since both teams employ the wishbone, the linebackers are particularly important in this game for stopping any ground attack and the options from the wishbone.
154	MERRILL, I.B.M. END VENTURE	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DF123FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The International Business Machines Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Company said yesterday that they would end their once-promising venture in computerizing the financial services industry.\nThe International Business Machines Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Company said yesterday that they would end their once-promising venture in computerizing the financial services industry.\nThey said the action followed a ''reassessment'' of the financial feasibility of the venture, called International Marketnet.\nThe failure appeared to be a setback for both companies, which had staked millions of dollars on the highly publicized project. Over the last two and a half years, executives of the venture - commonly known as Imnet - had predicted that the combination of I.B.M., with its technical prowess, and Merrill Lynch, with its understanding of the needs of brokers and investors, could leap ahead of competitors like Quotron Systems Inc., now a subsidiary of Citicorp. Termination Is Sudden\nTwo years ago, Joseph P. Castellano, the head of the Imnet venture, said, ''In five or six years we think the market for Marketnet could be as big as $1 billion.''\nBut yesterday Imnet's 267 staff members were called to a meeting to learn of the sudden termination. Top executives of the venture left its financial district headquarters, and company spokesmen said they would be unavailable. Nor would executives of Merrill Lynch and I.B.M. comment, and efforts to reach Mr. Castellano at home were unsuccessful.\nIn the last 24 months, Imnet discovered that few brokerages other than Merrill Lynch were willing to pay the steep price for the company's services, which combine analytical software and data bases accessible by satellite from central computers.\n''It cost too much, and the market just evaporated,'' one midlevel official of the venture said yesterday. ''Starting about the middle of this year, it became clear the whole idea was a disaster.''\nI.B.M. and Merrill Lynch announced the end of the project in a four-sentence release. Both companies said the decision had been made ''at the highest levels'' of both companies - presumably meaning it was approved by John F. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive, and William Schreyer, who holds the same title at Merrill Lynch.\nThe companies said the decision to close Imnet would have no significant effect on earnings for 1986 or 1987. Many Others Have Failed\nWith yesterday's announcement, Imnet joins a long list of home and office information services that have failed in recent years. Last month, CBS Inc. pulled out of Trintex, a failing videotex venture with I.B.M. and Sears that was established at about the same time as Imnet.\nIn March, Knight-Ridder Inc., the newspaper publisher, abandoned its $50 million videotex effort, intended to bring news, stock prices and shopping information to home computers. The Times Mirror Company and the Centel Corporation also abandoned their offerings in southern California and Chicago.\nBut Imnet was developed for a sophisticated audience - financial professionals - and was intended to do much more than provide information. With Merrill's own 500 branch offices as the first customers, the system was considered a serious competitor of Quotron - whose stock value plunged nearly 30 percent when I.B.M. and Merrill first announced their plans. A Promising Start\nThe venture seemed extremely promising at first. I.B.M. was contributing its computer technology, using a variant of its personal computer as the vehicle for both distributing information to brokers and allowing them to analyze portfolios and assess the future of equities.\nAt the same time, Merrill was focusing on the software and marketing, providing brokers in remote offices with instant access to its research reports and up-to-date recommendations for purchases and sales. The plan was that brokers could eventually trade over the system, which would be connected by satellite to Merrill's central computers.\nBut the only product that Imnet installed in volume was System 100, a program for analysis of equities that was never hooked to the Imnet network. A sophisticated portfolio-management system - intended for Merrill's offices and marketing to other brokerages - was being tested at the time the project was abandoned. Market Misjudged\nBut if the Imnet system was far more sophisticated than home offerings, it appeared to fail for the same reason they did: A misjudgment about how many customers would be willing to pay the price for the added information.\n''The marketplace had not developed as we anticipated,'' said Traug Keller, Imnet's director of communications. ''As we began to install the system, we thought we would find a much more sympathetic marketplace. But to get wide acceptance, the pricing structure had to change dramatically - and that shrinks the margin.''\nAnother Imnet official said a recent review of a study, started at I.B.M.'s instigation, had concluded that ''the project would not be profitable for a long, long time, and might never be profitable at all.''\nThe cancellation also appears to end a joint effort of Imnet and the Public Broadcasting System, which announced two years ago that it would send stock quotations and financial news to home subscribers over an unused portion of its television signal. PBS officials, who had hoped the system would bring millions of dollars to the nonprofit broadcaster, were unavailable for comment.\nCorrection: January 14, 1987, Wednesday, Late City Final Edition

He was 65 years old.\nMr. Dougherty lived in Quogue, L.I., and also had an apartment in Manhattan. He served as press secretary for George McGovern's Presidential campaign in 1972 and as Deputy Police Commissioner of New York City for community relations in the 1950's. He had earlier been a newspaperman.\nHe joined the museum in 1974 with the title of vice director for public affairs, which was later changed to vice president for public affairs. He retired in 1984.\nAt the museum, he was in charge of fund raising, membership and public relations. Fund raising flourished in his era and the membership of the museum more than doubled, Emily Rafferty, the vice president for development, said yesterday; it is now 110,000, which is the largest membership of any museum in the United States.\nPhilippe de Montebello, the director of the museum, said Mr. Dougherty was ''outrageously charming, funny, outspoken and so often right.''\nHe added, ''I'll deeply miss his counsel and good cheer.''\nThomas Hoving, the director of the museum from 1967 to 1977, said Mr. Dougherty was ''one of the brightest sparklers at the museum in his day; he brought that professionalism and experience that you get as a journalist, with a lot of political smarts.''\nMr. Hoving, now editor in chief of Connoisseur magazine, said Mr. Dougherty played important roles ''in puncturing every hot-air balloon in sight'' at the museum and in bringing it ''into the real world of the late 20th century.'' Consultant to Museum\nAfter retiring, Mr. Dougherty was a consultant to the museum, advising executives and coordinating the search committee that chose the new president, William H. Luers - a former United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia and Venezuela - to succeed William B. Macomber, who retired in June.\nFund-raising innovations at the museum while Mr. Dougherty was vice president included the creation of the business committee, an advisory group that helps raise money from the business community, and other, similar panels.\nEarlier in his career, Mr. Dougherty was the New York bureau chief of The Los Angeles Times. He was with The New York Herald Tribune as a reporter, from 1948 to 1951, and as a national political writer in its Washington bureau, from 1964 to 1966.\nHe wrote five novels, ''A Summer World'' (1960); ''Duggan'' (1962); ''The Commissioner'' (1962), which was the basis for the movie and television series ''Madigan''; ''We Dance and Sing'' (1971), and ''Botch/Up,'' which he finished shortly before his death, as well as a nonfiction book, ''Goodbye, Mr. Christian: A Personal Account of McGovern's Rise and Fall'' (1973).\nDuring his varied career he was also a playwright and a television news executive and held other posts in journalism and public affairs.\nA native of Bolivar, N.Y., Mr. Dougherty was a sergeant in the Army Air Force during World War II and earned an A.B. degree from Columbia University in 1948.\nHe is survived by his wife, the former Cynthia Abbott; two sisters, Maureen Nagle of Bolivar and Elizabeth Kornreich of Manhattan, and a daughter, Elizabeth Dougherty.\nA memorial service is scheduled on Jan. 9 at 4:30 P.M. in St. Bartholomew's Church, 109 East 50th Street.\nRICHARD DOUGHERTY, 65, DIES

The plan passed by a large margin in both houses. But citizen groups and others were critical.\n''They figured the votes were there to pass what needed to be passed,'' said Paul H. Elisha, executive director of the New York State branch of Common Cause, a citizen advocacy group. ''But at a time when there's a great deal of discussion about raises for legislators, a full-time Legislature, the whole manner in which this special session was handled shows a very cavalier attitude on the part of legislators to the needs of the constituents. One would hope that that's not a bellwether for the year to come.'' #30 Absentees Recorded Of the 40 state senators who represent the 12-county area served by the M.T.A., 11 were officially listed as absent or ''excused.'' And in the Assembly, which has 94 members whose districts fall within the M.T.A. service area, 19 members were similarly listed.\nThe counties served by the M.T.A. include the five of New York City, as well as Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Dutchess and Putnam.\nSpokesmen for the absent legislators ascribed the poor turnout Tuesday to the timing of the special session, together with the certainty of the vote's outcome. The bill's fate, they said, was decided in negotiations last week.\nTimothy J. Taylor, a spokesman for Senator Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan, the Senate minority leader, said that Mr. Ohrenstein had longstanding arrangements for a family trip to Austria and that he had been assured by Governor Cuomo there was no reason to cancel those plans. He said Mr. Ohrenstein, a Democrat, would have returned to Albany if there had been any indication of a crisis. 'No One Anticipated It'\n''For the session to go over the holidays was an extraordinary thing, and no one anticipated it,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''People were coming out of a grueling election year and legitimately made holiday plans.''\nIn addition, he said, ''the difficulties over the course of the session involved political issues, not the issue of attendance. Once the negotiations were completed, the obligation was to produce the votes to pass the bill, and that was done.''\nA spokesman for Senator Roy M. Goodman, a Manhattan Republican who also missed the vote, would not say where he was but added that he, too, had made arrangements to return to Albany if his vote was needed.\nSome legislators - despite previous plans - felt they had an obligation to be here. Senator Donald M. Halperin, a Brooklyn Democrat, interrupted a family vacation in Florida to be present for the vote, saying he felt the terms of the final compromise remained uncertain until late in the negotiations. 'It Was Still Unclear'\n''I don't think anybody really knew what the exact vote or exact tally would be,'' he said. ''It was still unclear as to whether or not there would be an an agreement. Monday night is when they came up with the last part of the deal.''\nReached by telephone in Florida, where he returned late Tuesday, Mr. Halperin said he felt that his decision to return was correct but that he did not feel any ill will toward other legislators who did not attend.\n''We talk about the family of New York, but legislators have families and children and wives who can be very upset by things like this,'' he said.\nThese are the members of the Legislature from the M.T.A. service area who were officially listed as absent or excused from Tuesday's vote: State Senate Howard Babbush (D-Brooklyn) Abraham Bernstein (D-Bronx) John E.

157	COST OF U.S. BENEFIT PROGRAMS RISING	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D8123FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: New estimates by the Congressional Budget Office show that the cost of Government benefit programs is increasing much faster than had been expected.\nNew estimates by the Congressional Budget Office show that the cost of Government benefit programs is increasing much faster than had been expected.\nThe increase appears to result in part from decisions by state officials to expand social welfare programs such as Medicaid, which provides health care to the poor and is financed jointly by the Federal Government and the states.\nIn the Medicaid program, states set eligibility criteria and define the scope of benefits within guidelines set by Federal law. In the last year many states have expanded Medicaid eligibility or increased benefits to provide more assistance to pregnant women and children from low-income families.\nIn each state, the Federal Government pays at least half the costs of Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal-state welfare program. Giant Share of U.S. Spending\nBenefit programs account for nearly half of all Federal spending. In August the budget office estimated that the cost of these programs would rise from $467 billion in the current fiscal year, 1987, to $499 billion in 1988 and eventually to $593 billion in 1991.\nAides to Rudolph G. Penner, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said today that the new estimates were $10 billion to $15 billion higher for 1987 and for 1988, and more than $20 billion higher for 1991.\nThese figures suggest that it will be difficult for Congress to meet the deficit targets set in the budget-balancing law signed by President Reagan in December 1985. The targets are $144 billion for 1987 and $108 billion for 1988. Under the law, the budget is supposed to be balanced by 1991.\nMr. Reagan plans to submit his 1988 budget to Congress on Monday. His budget director, James C. Miller 3d, has said that the President's budget would show a deficit of no more than $108 billion in 1988. Estimates of the cost of benefit programs have not yet been made public, and the budget does not contain a figure combining all the benefit programs.\nThe latest estimates by the Congressional Budget Office mean that Democrats will be under new pressure to restrain the growth of domestic programs that they might otherwise want to expand. Democrats in the Senate and the House have begun drafting legislation to expand welfare, Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid.\nUnder the major benefit programs, such as Social Security, student loans and unemployment compensation, people are entitled to benefits if they meet certain eligibility requirements set by law. In some of the programs, there is a test of financial need. But in others, people can obtain benefits regardless of their income or asssets.\nSeveral of the programs provide assistance to farmers to support the prices of agricultural commodities such as corn, wheat, rice and cotton. Aides to Mr. Penner said the projected costs of these programs had risen substantially above the levels estimated in August: $19.7 billion for 1987 and $21.6 billion for 1988. But they said the new figures would not be disclosed for at least a week. Change in Revenue Estimates\nAdministration officials said President Reagan's budget would show revenue dramatically different from that estimated by Congress when it approved a major tax bill in September.\nAt that time, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation compared the new measure with prior law and concluded that it would generate $11 billion more in 1987, but $17 billion less in 1988.\nBut Mr. Reagan's budget, using estimates developed by the Treasury Department, says the new law will produce a bigger gain in 1987, $18 billion, and no loss at all in 1988.\nDavid H. Brockway, chief of staff for the joint committee, said the panel had not changed its estimates.\nThe Treasury's figures have political implications because they would make it easier for the President and Congress to reduce the deficit in 1987 and 1988. But in later years the Treasury's estimates would have a different effect, because they show smaller gains in revenue, or more of a loss, than the joint committee's estimates.\nMost state income-tax laws are linked to Federal tax law in some way. Thirty-five states are expected to gain revenue if they make no change in their own laws. Some of the states plan to use part of that money to expand social welfare benefits.\nSuch changes could require a further increase in Federal spending because the Federal Government shares the cost of several major social welfare programs. The Federal contribution ranges from 50 percent to 78 percent of the cost of benefits under Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Increase for Science Foundation\nWhile proposing cuts in many domestic programs, Administration officials said Mr. Reagan would seek an increase of more than 15 percent in the budget of the National Science Foundation, which supports research in science and engineering. The agency has a budget of $1.6 billion this year.\nThe proposed increase is part of Mr. Reagan's overall effort to ''keep America competitive'' by maintaining its technological edge over other countries.\nBut budget officials said Mr. Reagan would ask Congress to slash the budget of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations around the country. Congress has already voted to give the corporation $214 million in 1988, $228 million in 1989 and $254 million 1990.\nMr. Reagan wants to cut the corporation's budget to $170 million in 1988, $140 million in 1989 and $132 million in 1990, according to confidential budget documents.

Government officials said the country would probably grow by another 2.2 million in 1987.\nWhile the new figure represents a sizable increase, it is well below the record for net population growth in a single year. In 1956 the population in the United States jumped 3.1 million, to 168 million.\nThe current population figure is based on an estimated 3.7 million births, 2.1 million deaths and a net migration of 554,000 in 1986.\nBirth and death levels are expected to be slightly higher in 1987, with the birth figure projected to be at its highest level since the 1960's, the bureau said.\nThe population increased nine-tenths of one percent in 1985 and 1986 and 1 percent in each year from 1981 to 1984. In contrast, the annual rate of increase in the peak years of the Baby Boom, from 1947 to 1961, ranged from 1.6 percent to 1.9 percent.

But many national Democratic figures, who have told Mr. Cuomo he must send a signal of his intentions by early 1987 if he is to have any chance of winning the Presidential nomination, said they viewed his travel plans as the early stage of a White House campaign.\n''There is no basis to say I'm being coy about running for President,'' Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. ''If I chose to explore the Presidency, I wouldn't do it in a backward way. I'll say I'm exploring the Presidency.''\nBut when asked outright if he was running, he did not completely rule out the possibility of a race. ''It's what I've always said: 'I have no plans,' '' he said.\nThe Governor, whose first-term lieutenant governor resigned two years ago, said that with the beginning of a second term on Thursday, with a new lieutenant governor, he now felt he could spend more time traveling. He acknowledged that the trips would stir talk of a Presidential race, but said he had found that speculation existed no matter what actions he took.\nMr. Cuomo, who was to be sworn in tonight in a private ceremony at the Governor's mansion, added that in the past he had frequently turned down speaking engagements elsewhere in the country for fear of generating speculation about the Presidency and that, as a result, ''I have forfeited the opportunity to say good things.'' Trips to Crucial States\nThe five states he mentioned for visits early in 1987 include ones considered crucial to any Presidential race. Three of the states - Florida, North Carolina and Louisiana -are in the South, an area where many strategists have said Mr. Cuomo needs to spend time to soften an image as ''a Northeastern liberal.'' Many national strategists say the South could be the key in the 1988 race for the Presidency.\nA fourth state, Iowa, holds the earliest official Presidential test, the Iowa caucuses, in early 1988. And the other state, California, is home to many large campaign contributors and has the most electoral votes.\n''I would suspect that for Mario Cuomo, this is the first stage of something,'' said Gov. Richard W. Riley of South Carolina. ''This is the first I have known of any concrete evidence that he might really be an interested candidate.''\n''This is a right interesting occurrence,'' said Mr. Riley, who is a former chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. ''This look-see is good for him and the Democratic Party, and I would like to see more of it.''\nMr. Cuomo's travel plans include the following:\n* Feb. 11, in Los Angeles for the 15th anniversary dinner of the Center for Law and the Public Interest.\n* Feb. 16, at Tulane University in New Orleans for a symposium entitled ''Directions 1987.''\n* Feb. 27, at a forum sponsored in Boca Raton, Fla., by the political columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. The Gover-nor may also stop at the spring-training camps of the Mets and the Yankees.\n* In March, on a date yet to be set, for a forum at Duke University in Chapel Hill, N.C.\n* In May, on a date not released, in Grinnell, Iowa, for the commencement speech at Grinnell College.\nMr. Cuomo has traveled extensively nationally before - in 1986, he made six trips outside New York State, not including occasional official visits to Washington. But previously, he has always announced trips individually. The fact that he disclosed five trips at one time was viewed by national strategists as an intention to send a signal. 'Nothing Spectacular'\nMr. Cuomo responded that ''these aren't political trips.''\n''This is nothing spectacular,'' he continued. ''These are all invitations that have been lingering for a long time and I told them decisions would not be made until the end of the legislative session.''\nDemocratic officials in several of the states said that while Mr. Cuomo was visiting they wanted him to attend political functions as well, such as fund-raising events. Asked about that, Mr. Cuomo said those requests had not yet reached him. ''Nobody's asked me,'' he said.\nWhen asked if there was a theme that he would stress throughout his trips, the Governor said he doubted so because the forums were so varied and because some of them would be mostly question-and-answer sessions. 'Like Going to a Carnival'\n''Evans and Novak - that's pure fun,'' he said jokingly of the Florida visit. ''They're all conservatives and you stand up there and they all beat you up. It's like going to a carnival where they tie your hands behind your back and they throw baseballs at your head.''\nLater in the interview, however, the Governor sounded a theme that he has been talking about more and more and that many expect would be the thrust of a Presidential campaign. He talked about a failure by the Reagan Administration and by Washington generally to recognize that economic problems -unemployment, the Federal deficit, the imbalance in trade, third-world debt -are interconnected and require a broad, unified solution.\nReferring to the economic problems, he pointed out that both houses of Congress would be Democratic beginning in 1987 and added, ''With this wonderful opportunity the Democrats fought to win, comes a very heavy burden of responsibility because now you have to produce.''
161	REAGAN SENDS UPBEAT SPEECH TO SOVIET PEOPLE OVER 'VOICE'	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D8133FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: President Reagan, in a New Year's message to the Soviet Union, said today that the two countries were ''closer now than ever before'' to an agreement to reduce nuclear arsenals.\nPresident Reagan, in a New Year's message to the Soviet Union, said today that the two countries were ''closer now than ever before'' to an agreement to reduce nuclear arsenals.\nIn a 10-minute radio broadcast, which the Voice of America also transmitted to Eastern Europe, Mr. Reagan said that the United States and the Soviet Union had taken major steps toward permanent peace in 1986.\nThe upbeat comment offered a different assessment of Soviet-American relations than the one given in Moscow. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry rejected a proposal that Mr. Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev exchange New Year's greetings over television, as they did last New Year's Day.\nThe Soviet spokesman said such an exchange at this time would be inappropriate in view of what he described as the low state of relations and a deadlock in arms control talks.\nAfter the Soviet rejection, the White House decided to transmit Mr. Reagan's message by radio.\nIn the speech, Mr. Reagan said that the Iceland summit meeting on Oct. 25-26 had yielded positive results despite its collapse over limitation of space-based missile defenses.\nAlthough the aftermath has left a new arms control accord in doubt, according to American officials, Mr. Reagan said:\n''We did move things a good distance forward. On many issues, we made more progress in those two days than our diplomats made in the last two years. Yes, a great deal of work remains, but both sides are closer now than ever before.''\nMr. Reagan did not mention two of the issues that, according to Soviet spokesmen, have chilled relations. One is Mr. Reagan's decision to stop adhering informally to the provisions of the unratified strategic arms limitation treaty of 1979. The other is his refusal to join Mr. Gorbachev in a halt of nuclear weapon testing.\nIn his message, Mr. Reagan seemed to praise the Soviet Union for its decision to end the exile of Andrei D. Sakharov, the physicist and rights advocate.\n''Whenever there is a restoration of those rights to a man or a woman, as has happened recently,'' Mr. Reagan said, ''it helps strengthen the foundations for trust and cooperation between our two countries. And by the same token, whenever those rights are denied, the foundation is seriously weakened. We welcome progress in this area, as much as we welcome it in the effort to secure nuclear arms reduction.''\nMr. Reagan and his wife, Nancy, arrived here Monday from Los Angeles to spend the New Year at the 220-acre estate of Walter Annenberg, the publisher. The Reagans have welcomed the New Year at the Annenberg estate for nearly two decades.

165	HILL IS ACHIEVING GOALS FOR KNICKS	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DF113FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: During his first month as head coach of the Knicks, Bob Hill spoke often about how the team, after more than two horrendous seasons, must ''learn how to win'' again. He repeated the phrase so often, in fact, that it began to sound like the rantings of an eternal optimist - the kind who insists the glass is still half-full even when the bottom is bone dry.\nDuring his first month as head coach of the Knicks, Bob Hill spoke often about how the team, after more than two horrendous seasons, must ''learn how to win'' again. He repeated the phrase so often, in fact, that it began to sound like the rantings of an eternal optimist - the kind who insists the glass is still half-full even when the bottom is bone dry.\nHill even tried some not-so-subtle tactics, such as placing signs that read ''Unselfishness is contagious'' in the locker room, and putting on display three trophies representing the Knicks' three Eastern Conference championships. And he sometimes placed inspirational messages in players' lockers, one of which read: ''You play this game with your hands and feet, but you win it with your head.''\nThe players now admit it. They snickered.\nHill, however, appears to have gotten through. On Tuesday, the Knicks gained the kind of victory that some of the players say they would not have achieved under Hill's predecessor, Hubie Brown. Down by 10 points to the Washington Bullets with less than 7 minutes to play, they combined defensive intensity, offensive creativity and even a bit of trickery to attain a 103-97 triumph at Madison Square Garden that extended their winning streak to four games. Bullets Stifled\nThe defensive intensity stifled a team that appeared to have command of the contest with a 91-81 lead and two of the league's most explosive offense weapons - the Malones. Moses Malone, the center, and Jeff Malone, the guard, went into the game accounting for 47 percent of the Bullets' scoring with averages of 25.8 and 24.6 points per game, respectively. Together, they scored only one basket in the final minutes of the game and the Bullets scored only 6 points in the final 6 minutes 23 seconds.\nGerald Wilkins, as is becoming his habit, supplied the offensive creativity for the Knicks. He scored 10 of his game-high 29 points in that final 6:23 as the Knicks outscored the Bullets by 22-6. Two of his baskets came on soaring bank shots high off the glass on plays that could not have been more stunning if they were made by Michael Jordan.\nAnd the trickery? That was Hill's domain. First, he employed a three-guard alignment with Gerald Henderson, Trent Tucker and Wilkins. Then he allowed Tucker and Wilkins to decide who would play small forward. And, finally, he designed a play during a timeout that allowed the 6-foot-5-inch Wilkins to take advantage of a bigger, but slower defender, the 6-8 John Williams. Worked to Perfection\nIt all worked to perfection. Later, in the victorious locker room, talk centered on how much of an impact Hill has had on the same group of players that Brown could not affect. Would the Knicks have won this game with Brown as their coach?\n''No way,'' Trent Tucker said quickly. ''First of all, me and Gerald would not have been out there together and we would not have had the freedom to decided among ourselves who would play what position. And we simply wouldn't have known how to win the game.''\n''I don't know. I can't make that assessment,'' said Rory Sparrow, who had seven assists in just 19 minutes off the bench against the Bullets. ''We are playing with a lot more confidence than we were back then. If we had won this game six weeks ago, it might have been a freak, but I think we can do this every night.'' Ewing in Foul Trouble\n''The biggest thing is that we're a lot less predictable,'' said Bill Cartwright, who scored 23 of his 27 points in the first half to keep the Knicks in the contest when Patrick Ewing was held to just 5 minutes in the half because of fouls. ''We've made a lot of changes. The players laugh about it sometimes because we can't keep up with them. They're not big changes, it's just that other teams don't know what to expect from us now. It's tough to defend a team when you don't know what they're doing.''\nHill was evasive in answering the question, but he finally said that, under Brown, the Knicks ''probably wouldn't have come back like we did.''\nHe paused, thinking back to those times when he was an assistant coach for Brown, then re-emphasized his point. ''No question, it's all about learning how to win again. Once I'm on the sidelines, even I think we're going to win now.''

She introduced herself to the not-so-long-ago unknown young man from Elmont, L.I., who was now being honored at a dinner in Washington. The affair was not unlike the dinners in New York, Philadelphia and Dallas. The dinners have been interspersed with television appearances in Los Angeles and New York and a conversation with the President of the United States in Washington. The appearances have taken place before and after crack-of-dawn departures from airports and nearly-middle-of-the-night arrivals in other airports. Other scheduled events have been canceled well beyond the last minute, when people were waiting. The dinners and the attention and the smiles and the handshakes and the promise of financial security the near future holds, all have been a hard-earned reward for years of obscurity. Yet the moments, all of which have somehow been compressed into the past month, have seemed a blur except for just a few, including the time in Washington when Olga sat down beside him.\n''She's probably just a nice lady,'' he said that day.\nOlga had insisted to others that she was Vinny Testaverde's mother.\nWhich would come as a surprise to Josephine Testaverde of Elmont, L.I., whose 23-year-old son recently left a Heisman Trophy in her home. Tomorrow evening in the Arizona desert, he can become the eighth Heisman winner to play for a champion of a news-service poll. Testaverde would be just the third to play for an undefeated, untied national champion that won a bowl game, following Davey O'Brien, the Texas Christian quarterback in 1938, and Tony Dorsett, the Pittsburgh running back in 1976.\nRegardless of what is eventually said of his football career, regardless of the outcome of the Fiesta Bowl game tomorrow between his University of Miami Hurricanes and Penn State, it can never be correct to say that Testaverde never had a dinner. On the outside, he appears the same friendly, polite transplanted New Yorker who had been ignored while the crowds formed next door around the locker of Bernie Kosar, his predecessor as the Hurricane quarterback. ''We were at an Italian-American banquet in Pittsburgh,'' said Joe Paterno, the Penn State coach. ''My wife said he gave her his rolls, his butter. She couldn't get over how polite and shy he was.''\nWho knows what the sirens could possibly have been doing to the inside?\nPaterno and his recruiters have dominated Long Island in recent years, but he did not remember ever hearing the name Testaverde when the quarterback played for Sewanhaka High School. After tomorrow night, who will not have heard the name?\nTestaverde prepares for a football game he must know may well place a large permanent plus or minus next to his name. He has paused this week to think of responses to questions - a process he once found frightening - on topics such as the future of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the team that will soon own his professional rights, a subject that has nothing to do with his immediate existence and everything to do with what will come right around the next bend in the road.\nAmong his other gifts, Testaverde seems to have had a talent for seeing beyond the glitz to possess an understanding of who and what he is, and an ability to sidestep a sense of self-importance as if it were just another blitzing linebacker.\nHis need to be part of a group led him to join the camouflage-wearing platoon that descended in the desert this week. But while teammates have embarrassed themselves and their university with their us-against-the-world rhetoric, Testaverde offered how he enjoyed spending time with Shane Conlan, the Penn State linebacker.\nTwo years ago this week, when Kosar had not yet graduated from Miami and all logical thought seemed to indicate that Testaverde's professional interests would be best served by transfering to a school that held a better opportunity to play, he chose to remain. Less than five months ago, he perceived his growing fame by saying that he thought some football fans knew the University of Miami had a quarterback from Elmont, L.I. A revision has been made necessary by the last month. ''They may not know my name,'' he said this week, ''but they know a little bit about me. They know a little bit more than they did back then. I just feel like I have a lot of friends.''\nApparently. His new acquaintances have included that old jokester, Bob Hope; an ex-football broadcaster named Ronald Reagan, and that new talk-show hostess, Joan Rivers.\nWhen he returned to school, teammates were waiting. Mike Irvin, the sophomore wide receiver, remembered with a smile: ''We said, 'Hey, Vinny, could you put down the Heisman and get ready for Penn State?' Or, 'O.K., Vinny, you know the President. Now you can come to practice with the little people.' ''\n''He is at his best,'' said Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach, ''and he is most relaxed, when he is on the field. He would like to get up in the morning, put on sweats, lift weights and go out and play catch.''\nThe process has grown far more complicated. At Johnson's suggestion, a security guard employed by the university escorts Testaverde in public this week. ''I thought it was a good idea,'' Testaverde said. ''There are a lot of people walking around. You don't know if some of them are your friends and some of them are your enemies.''\nHis working regimen was disrupted by the pace of the schedule and the injury from his recent motor-scooter accident. His girlfriend of several years, who last August was one of the first people Testaverde suggested could lend some insight into who he is and where he has been, is now his former girlfriend. And more and more people want to be friends.\nSupporters of the idea for an annual national championship college football game might do well to consider a system that has already created the need for a well-adjusted college senior to be accompanied by a security guard.\nPLAYERS

USX said that the action would reduce its financial costs by more than $140 million a year.\nThe redemption will be made on March 1 for all of its 12.5 percent guaranteed notes due 1994. The company said that the redemption represented the last of the debt from the Marathon acquisition.\nUSX said it had arranged $1 billion in loans from Citibank to finance the redemption. The loan will be secured with future earnings from Marathon's prized Yates oilfield in Texas, the company said.\n''The redemption is a key element in the corporation's ongoing restructuring,'' USX's chairman, David M. Roderick, said.\nUSX also said talks were continuing between representatives of Mr. Roderick and Carl C. Icahn, the New York investor. In October, USX received a $31-a-share, $8 billion takeover proposal from Mr. Icahn. The company declined the proposal, saying it was studying various restructuring possibilities.\nMr. Roderick has maintained that the company has not yet determined what form any restructuring would take. He said a restructuring plan would be presented to the company's board by the end of January.\nThe company has received a proposed restructuring package from Goldman, Sachs & Company, its financial advisers. USX said the options presented were numerous. USX has said it would consider a number of possibilities, including a large stock buyback, the sale of certain operations or doing nothing at all. No Mediator Recommendation\nThe company also said yesterday that a mediator had declined to make recommendations for a settlement in a work stoppage by the United Steelworkers union that has idled USX's plants for the last five months.\nEarlier, USX had said it wanted recommendations by yesterday for a settlement. ''We had hoped for a recommendation by Dec. 31,'' a USX spokesman said. ''But deadlines don't seem to mean much in this business.''\nBruce Johnston, USX executive vice president, and James McGeehan, union treasurer, have been negotiating regularly with Sylvester Garrett, a steel labor specialist, since mid-December, when Mr. Garrett was brought in to end an impasse in the talks. Sources close to the negotiations said the talks would probably resume tomorrow. No progress has been reported since Mr. Garrett's appointment on Dec. 18.
168	RAJ NARAIN, 69, INDIAN SOCIALIST: HELPED DEFEAT TWO GOVERNMENTS	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DE113FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Raj Narain, a colorful Socialist leader who defeated Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in a parliamentary election and played a key role in the fall of a successor, died of a heart attack here Tuesday night. He was 69 years old.\nRaj Narain, a colorful Socialist leader who defeated Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in a parliamentary election and played a key role in the fall of a successor, died of a heart attack here Tuesday night. He was 69 years old.\nMr. Narain was active in the independence movement against Britain and was later imprisoned scores of times for his leadership of opposition movements.\nFirst elected to India's upper house of Parliament in 1966, Mr. Narian became known for his antics and rowdy behavior. He was sometimes asked to leave the chamber and on several occasions had to be carried out by parliamentary officers.\nIn 1975 a high court upheld Mr. Narain's charges of electoral fraud against Mrs. Gandhi. The charges concerned a 1971 election for the lower house that Mr. Narain, who often wore a green bandana around his head, had lost by more than 100,000 votes.\nThe verdict led to the authoritarian state of emergency that Mrs. Gandhi declared soon after, arresting thousands of critics, including Mr. Narain, and imposing news censorship. Defeated Mrs. Gandhi\nNearly two years later, when Mrs. Gandhi called new elections and freed her critics, Mr. Narain and his colleagues rode a popular wave of unrest to defeat her and her Government. He won decisively in the Prime Minister's home constituency of Rae Bareli.\nIn the new Government of Prime Minister Morarji R. Desai, an ascetic follower of Mohandas K. Gandhi, Mr. Narain was appointed Health Minister. He set about changing the policy on family planning and renounced forced sterilizations.\nMr. Desai dismissed Mr. Narain and his chief ally, Home Affairs Minister Charan Singh, for working against his Janata Party Government. The governing party then comprised four opposition groups, including the Socialists, that had merged in 1977 to oppose Mrs. Gandhi.\nAlthough there was a brief reconciliation in the Janata Party, Mr. Narain later led a fierce party revolt that toppled Mr. Desai in the summer of 1979 and replaced him with Mr. Singh as Prime Minister. The new Government collapsed when Mrs. Gandhi withdrew a pledge of support, and in elections at the beginning of 1980 she swept back to power with a landslide. Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated in 1984 and was succeeded by her son, Rajiv.\nMr. Narain fell out with Mr. Singh after the 1980 opposition debacle and finally founded his own Socialist Party, which had few followers.\nHe recently completed a Hindi-language movie in which he played the part of Manu, the deity who is revered as a lawmaker by pious Hindus.\nMr. Narain is survived by his wife and four children.
169	A LUXURY LINE FALTERS AT G.M.	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DE113FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Rob Mancuso said his heart sank when the General Motors Corporation first displayed its new, downsized Cadillac Seville and Eldorado models to dealers in Las Vegas about a year ago. ''The guy next to me and I looked at each other and we said the same thing: 'They're not going to sell.' ''\nRob Mancuso said his heart sank when the General Motors Corporation first displayed its new, downsized Cadillac Seville and Eldorado models to dealers in Las Vegas about a year ago. ''The guy next to me and I looked at each other and we said the same thing: 'They're not going to sell.' ''\nUnfortunately for himself and for G.M., Mr. Mancuso, a Cadillac and Honda dealer in the Chicago suburb of Barrington, Ill., was right. The two Cadillacs and their companion models, the Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado, are G.M.'s biggest automotive sales flop of 1986. And because these high-priced cars (the Seville has a base sticker price of $26,326) are also among G.M.'s most profitable, their sickly sales have contributed to the company's woes.\nG.M.'s problems include a falling market share and a $338.5 million operating loss in the third quarter of 1986, but the four luxury models are ''the single biggest product fiasco'' in recent G.M. history, said Maryann N. Keller, an auto industry analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney in New York. Sales Fall 51 Percent\nAll four models are built on what G.M. calls its ''E/K platform.'' In 1985, the E/K's predecessors had combined sales of 161,437 in the January through November period. The total in the comparable period of 1986 slipped to 78,941, a 51 percent decline. Since the estimated profit on these models is more than $5,000 a car, industry analysts figure the slump in E/K sales will reduce G.M.'s earnings by some $500 million this year.\nOne primary problem seems to be the belief of many drivers that they no longer need to drive smaller cars and conserve gasoline. Just as soaring gasoline prices caught G.M. and Detroit with big, gas-guzzling cars twice in the 1970's, now G.M. is trying to sell cars designed for fuel scarcity at a time when gasoline is plentiful and big cars are back in favor. When these cars were being designed, G.M. forecasters were predicting prices of $2 a gallon for gasoline; it is currently selling for closer to $1. Decline in Owner Loyalty\nG.M. executives acknowledge that previous buyers of Eldorados, Rivieras, Sevilles and Toronados do not like the new versions, which are smaller, lighter and less powerful -but more expensive - than those they replaced. In addition, the new models strongly resemble some of the company's lower-priced cars - a serious problem in the luxury-car market, where buyers seek distinction as much as comfort.\n''Almost every Eldorado or Seville sale now has to be a 'conquest sale,' '' commented William E. Hoglund, the head of G.M.'s Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group. A conquest sale, in Detroit parlance, is one in which the buyer previously drove a competing make. ''In the past,'' Mr. Hoglund added, ''in those product lines, we relied heavily on owner loyalty.''\nMeanwhile, G.M.'s competitors report strong sales of their traditional, rear-wheel-drive luxury cars. Production of Ford's Lincoln Town Car was increased during the year, and the Chrysler Corporation has arranged to use American Motors' production facilities so it could continue to build the Chrysler Fifth Avenue, a model that had been scheduled for elimination. 'Elrivado' Styling Criticized\nAuto industry watchers say sales of the E/K models have slumped, in part, because they share the problem of ''lookalike'' styling that has plagued other G.M. lines in recent years.\nCar and Driver magazine, in a review of the Buick Riviera, said it looks like a Somerset Regal - a smaller, less expensive model -''with a case of terminal swayback.'' The magazine added that for a car that is supposed to be an expression of the owner's personality, ''The new Riv is so low-key as to be invisible in a parking lot full of contemporary G.M. models.''\nOther assessments were similarly unflattering. Road & Track magazine called the cars, collectively, the ''Elrivado.'' The models were so much alike, it said, it did not make sense to review them separately.\nIrvin W. Rybicki, who recently retired as G.M.'s vice president for design, said model lines that lacked styling distinction resulted from fears about another energy crisis, as well as G.M.'s huge conversion from rear-wheel to front-wheel drive and the pressure from management to hold down development budgets.\n''With all the investments that were being made in plants and engineering, there wasn't a lot of money left for sheet metal,'' Mr. Rybicki said. Designers ''had to play the corporate game'' and accept fewer styling touches than they would have liked. Not Impressive Enough\nG.M. also erred, some outside analysts said, in introducing the E/K luxury cars soon after the similarly styled - but smaller and lower-priced - ''N'' platform cars: the Buick Somerset Regal, Oldsmobile Calais and Pontiac Grand Am. Traditionally, G.M. established styling trends with its more expensive cars and in later years incorporated those themes in cheaper models.\nMr. Mancuso, the Illinois G.M. dealer, said prospective buyers of the Seville and Eldorado had told him the cars simply did not look impressive enough. ''They don't want them sitting in their driveway,'' he said.\nThere has been criticism of the cars' interiors, as well. In its quest to be technically sophisticated, Buick installed a cathode-ray tube with a touch-sensitive screen in the Riviera. It monitors engine functions and controls the heating and cooling systems, the radio and cassette player and a trip computer, but it is in the middle of the instrument panel, out of the driver's line of vision.\nA driver who wants to change radio stations or adjust the temperature must take his eyes off the road and touch the screen one or more times to pull up the right computer ''menu'' and make the adjustment. Noting that Buick says the screen replaces 92 switches, Road & Track commented, ''After driving the Riviera for a while, even the prospect of driving a car with 92 switches was more appealing.''\nDealers and analysts add that young, technically sophisticated buyers - those who might find touch-screen controls appealing - are unlikely to shop for a Riviera because of its history as a large car with an older target audience. Larger Versions Planned\nStretched versions of the E/K cars are on G.M.'s drawing boards, but because of the long lead times in the auto industry they will not be available until late 1988 as 1989 models.\nIn the meantime, in a move to balance supply with sales, G.M. is cutting production from two shifts to one at its showplace assembly plant on the border of Detroit and Hamtramck. By cutting production, G.M. may be able to avoid the costly incentives it would need to sell an oversupply of the models - but it also means the overhead of the $1 billion, automation-packed plant will be spread over fewer cars, squeezing G.M.'s profit margin.\nG.M. executives are also trying different marketing strategies to sell the cars available now. Cadillac cut the price of 1987 Sevilles and Eldorados by about 6 percent, and added equipment to the Buick and Oldsmoble models while holding the price line. Buick also added a travel incentive, promising Riviera buyers two airline tickets to any destination served by Trans World Airlines until Feb. 28.\nMr. Hoglund said that until the 1989 models arrive, G.M.'s basic strategy is to use special marketing programs to induce sales prospects to take test drives. Once inside the cars, the hope is that customers will think less about the size and styling and be impressed by the ride, handling and appointments. ''If somebody has a better solution, I'd like to hear it,'' Mr. Hoglund said.

Stephens will get about $100 million stated value of a new series of cumulative convertible preferred stock for the facilities, which Beverly leases.\nThe restructuring plan calls for Beverly to slow its acquisition program from 13,500 beds annually to between 3,000 and 5,000 beds in 1987 and includes the sale of some of the company's durable medical equipment operations. Robert Van Tuyle, chairman and chief executive, said the company planned to focus on its long-term care facilities.

The gains were trimmed a bit near the close.\n''Prices continue to advance on the belief that the OPEC agreement is going to work,'' said Peter Beutel, an analyst in New York with Elders Futures Inc. Although the upward price move had ultimately met resistance, he said, ''the market is still giving OPEC a strong vote of confidence for its efforts.''\nWest Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 29 cents higher, with the February contract at $17.94 a barrel; heating oil was 0.76 cent to 1.11 cents higher, with February at 49.95 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.70 cent to 1.24 cents higher, with February at 49.34 cents a gallon.\nPrecious metals futures also surged yesterday.\nThe metals were helped by the strong advance of energy futures, signaling the possibility of greater inflation, according to Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.

Botha announced tonight that there would be early general elections next year for the nation's white electorate.\nPresident P. W. Botha announced tonight that there would be early general elections next year for the nation's white electorate.\nThe move, political commentators said, was designed to win a renewed mandate for the Afrikaner National Party after 28 months of black revolt, mounting international ostracism and increasing reliance on emergency rule to withstand demands for black majority rule. The party has been in power since 1948.\nMr. Botha, who made the announcement in a televised New Year's message, said he would announce a date for the election in January. Press commentators, who have been speculating about an election for months, have suggested that it will be held in mid-March. Elections were not expected until 1989.\nIn the broadcast, Mr. Botha set an electioneering tone, seeking to rally white voters by condemning Western powers, including the United States, for hypocrisy toward his land and by vowing that his Government was ''not prepared to sacrifice our right of self-determination in our fatherland.'' A Promise to Whites\nThe language represented a coded promise to the white minority of five million that their Afrikaner leaders would not hand over the country to a black government drawn from majority rule based on an unqualified, universal franchise.\nMr. Botha made no announcement of new elections for the two junior houses in the country's segregated three-chamber Parliament - those occupied by legislators of mixed and Indian racial descent. Those legislatures were chosen in elections in 1984 marked by widespread abstentions and the first stirrings of the nation's violence and protest, which have claimed 2,300 lives since September 1984.\n''I think the time to consult the white electorate on a number of fundamental issues is fast approaching,'' he said in his broadcast.\n''By-elections should in any event have been held in the near future in a number of constituencies. It is consequently preferable to hold a general election for the House of Assembly in the coming year.''\nMr. Botha did not say whether the vote would be held under the nation's newest emergency decree, in force since June 12, which makes it an offense to oppose or resist the authorities in their handling of the nation's crisis. Program Is Stalled\nSouth African political commentators have suggested that Mr. Botha, aged 70 years and reportedly concerned about his health, wishes to cement his party in power among white voters before stepping down and leaving to others the job of continuing his program of cautious racial reform.\nThat program has all but stalled in the nation's unrest. While the authorities have scrapped some apartheid legislation, such as the pass laws inhibiting black access to the fringes of white cities, they have balked at further changes in such laws as those that segregate schools and residential areas.\nReferring to foreign pressures on his Government to accelerate change, Mr. Botha declared tonight, ''We dare not yield to the irresponsible and often superficial demands which will destroy everything created over so many decades by so many generations.''\nIn an evident reference to sanctions by the United States and other Western countries and economic pressures such as divestment, he said, ''Actions taken against us have been totally counterproductive.'' 'This Incredible Haste'\nMr. Botha said it took the United States from 1776 to 1870 ''to complete their Constitution and grant civil liberties to its black minority community, and another century and a fierce civil rights struggle to insure that those rights were more than theoretical rights.''\n''Even after that, further amendments were necessary,'' he said.\n''So I put this question - why all this incredible and unnatural haste with the multi-cultural South Africa with our vast historical differences and traditions?\n''The course on which certain Western powers have now embarked directly serves the interests of the forces who do not seriously believe in democratic principles. These hypocritical forces do not want to have a negotiated, peaceful solution in South Africa.''\n''If they are allowed to play their present game, it can only result in the establishment of a tyrannical dictatorship in this country,'' he said. ''That we will oppose with a determined national will.''\nEditor's Note:\nSouth African press restrictions now prohibit journalists from transmitting dispatches on any security actions, protests, detentions or ''subversive statements'' without clearance by Government censors.

Mr. Griffith, a black man from Brooklyn, was struck by a car on Dec. 20 after he fled a group of white attackers, according to the police. 'Is Jewish Blood Cheaper?'\n''We agree that Howard Beach is terrible,'' said Rabbi Israel Rosenfeld, the director of the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council. ''We don't condone Howard Beach, but why is Jewish blood any cheaper than black blood?''\nAccording to the police, the victim, Israel Rosen, 49 years old, was hit over the head repeatedly with a wooden club while waiting for a train at the Kingston Avenue IRT station, at Eastern Parkway, at about 9 P.M. on July 2. His assailants, the police said, were five or six black youths, who fled without taking anything from the victim.\nCapt. Donald Bromberg, the commanding officer of the police department's Bias Incident Investigating Unit, said that the beating was investigated as a racial incident because of the different ethnic backgrounds of the attackers and the victim and ''because we were unable to find any other motive.'' Mr. Rosen, who had a beard, was dressed in the dark garb characteristic of Hasidic men. Reward Was Offered\nThe Jewish Community Relations Council of New York and its constituent council in Crown Heights offered a $5,000 reward in the case.

178	COLUMN ONE: Clean Air; U.S. Presses City To Cut Pollutants	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDB113FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Welcome to 1987, the year that New York's traffic and environmental planners must clear the air or face the Federal music.\nWelcome to 1987, the year that New York's traffic and environmental planners must clear the air or face the Federal music.\nThe refrain that the Federal Environmental Protection Agency plans to sound this year is familiar but unpleasant. New York City violates Federal Clean Air Act standards for two primary pollutants, ozone and carbon monoxide, both of which have been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular ailments. Bring down levels of the pollutants by the Dec. 31, 1987, deadline or suffer the consequences.\nOn paper, those consequences are serious: more than $300 million in Federal highway funds can be withheld, in addition to critical financing for sewage treatment plants and other capital projects. Whether the E.P.A. will actually impose the sanctions, however, is doubtful. Even the most optimistic officials say New York and about 30 other cities nationwide have little or no chance of meeting the deadline.\nThe best bet, according to city, state and Federal officials, is that the E.P.A. will require the city only to produce a plan showing that deadlines will eventually be met. The Commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, Harvey W. Schultz, said that meeting that goal will require many studies and long hours. ''It's not going to be an easy year,'' said Mr. Schultz. 'Menu of Options'\nPerhaps the most unsavory task has fallen to the city's Transportation Commissioner, Ross Sandler. Mr. Sandler has been put in charge of devising ways to cut traffic in the city and thus bring down the emissions that cause high levels of carbon monoxide.\nHaving carted around his ''menu of options'' for reducing congestion through the city, Mr. Sandler now says his department will make its choices by the end of the month. Drastic options like banning private cars have been dropped, but these are among a long list of remedies remaining in the running:\n* ''Congestion pricing.'' Requiring drivers to pay daily or monthly fees for using their cars in Manhattan south of 60th Street during busy hours.\n* Restricted license plate entry. Those cars with license plates ending in odd and even numbers would be alternately allowed to enter Manhattan.\n* Banning single-occupant vehicles from entering Manhattan.\n* Tougher restrictions on trucks, double parking and delivery times.\n* Heavier reliance on traffic agents to speed traffic. Mr. Sandler and others argue that reducing the number of cars with idling engines will eliminate the city's 80 carbon-monoxide hot spots. Opponents, such as the director of the Clean Air Campaign, Marcy Benstock, disagree: ''The more traffic you move rapidly,'' she said, ''the more you encourage to come in.'' Developers' Anxiety\nNew York's real-estate developers, whose buildings generate traffic, are also approaching the Clean Air deadlines with some anxiety.\nAccording to Mr. Schultz, three projects in downtown Brooklyn, the proposed Citicorp development in Queens, and elements of the Times Square redevelopment plan have all been slowed by the requirements of environmental studies. Late last year the regional administrator of the E.P.A., Christopher J. Daggett, fired his first warning shot when he rejected guarantees that a new hotel complex in downtown Brooklyn, the Renaissance Plaza, would meet clean air standards sometime in the 1990's. Mr. Daggett sent the developers back to the drawing board to conduct further studies.\nMembers of the powerful New York Real Estate Board, meanwhile, worry that community activists might find a useful weapon in the approaching deadlines. ''The statute,'' said Warren Wechsler, the board's vice president, ''could be used by parties that are resisting development rather than interested in air quality.'' Ms. Benstock of the Clean Air Campaign counters that developers should only be allowed to build in areas with easy access to mass transit. A Court Action\nThe city's environmental advocates, meanwhile, are not waiting for the deadline to come and go. The leading watchdog group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, will go to court later this month, charging that the city, state and Federal authorities are failing to follow state plans for reducing pollutants.\nAccording to the council's senior attorney, Eric Goldstein, state plans to reduce the levels of ozone - formed when gas vapors and other hydrocarbons react with sunlight and heat -have not been followed. Top on the forgotten list, he says, is a plan to control the release of gasoline vapors at service stations. He also knocks the state for failing to finish studies on the impact of industrial sources of ozone production, such as auto painting shops and commercial solvent producers.\nState and city officials reject Mr. Goldstein's assertions, but Mr. Daggett, the regional E.P.A. administrator, acknowledges that timetables have slipped. But as 1986 gives way to 1987, he promised, the E.P.A. will not hesitate ''to turn the screws tighter.''
179	LUMBER PACT WITH U.S. IS CRITICIZED IN CANADA	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DA113FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Canadian lumber industry executives today condemned an agreement that will set aside a 15 percent United States tariff penalty on Canadian softwood exports to the United States and replace it with a 15 percent Canadian export tax.\nCanadian lumber industry executives today condemned an agreement that will set aside a 15 percent United States tariff penalty on Canadian softwood exports to the United States and replace it with a 15 percent Canadian export tax.\nThe executives were joined by politicians opposed to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Government, which reached the agreement in Washington late Tuesday under the pressure of a midnight deadline set under United States trade law.\nThe agreement will apply to Canadian exports that captured 32 percent of the United States softwood market in 1985, at a value of about $2.9 billion.\nIndustry analysts here forecast that the new export tax will reverse a trend that has seen Canada widening its American market share in recent years, as layoffs and bankruptcies have increased in the United States softwood industry. American companies, contending that low fees in Canada for timber cutting amounted to an unfair subsidy, led the fight for a tariff penalty that resulted in a Commerce Department ruling that imposed the 15 percent import levy.\nCritics here had argued that Canada should resist increased softwood levies and should carry the issue into international trade tribunals if necessary. The Government, although bristling, decided to go for a quick settlement that would keep the increased duties, amounting to an estimated $435 million, in Canada. In addition, the officials wished to avoid a final ruling by the Commerce Department that they feared might encourage similar petitions by other American industries facing strong Canadian imports.\nThe announcement of the accord was greeted with satisfaction in official quarters. The Forestry Minister, Gerald Merrithew, said that it had avoided a potentially damaging precedent for Canadian industries, while the Premier of British Columbia, William Vander Zalm, whose province accounts for 70 percent of the softwood exports involved in the dispute, maintained that any damage would lie mainly with United States consumers faced with higher prices.\n''Life will go on,'' Mr. Vander Zalm said. ''The forest companies, I'm sure, will survive and continue to log and mill and do all of the wonderful things that create employment.''\nThis view was bitterly contested, however, by spokesmen for some of the companies affected. ''It's bizarre, it's sickening,'' said Adam Zimmerman, president of MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., one of the country's largest forest products companies. 'An Industrial Paraplegic'\nMr. Zimmerman, who is chairman of the Canadian Forest Industries Council, said that the Washington agreement had made ''an industrial paraplegic'' of Canadian lumber companies and threatened to wipe out their entire profits at a stroke.\nOther critics contended that the agreement would throw as many as 20,000 Canadians out of work, set a precedent for future American interference with the pricing of Canadian natural resources and encourage protectionist forces that have made this a troubled year in Canada-United States trade.\n''Whether we're talking about the export of wood products, pork, corn, tubular steel, fish, any major Canadian export now is subject to this kind of action by the United States,'' said Edward Broadbent, leader of the New Democratic Party, which is heavily backed by labor unions.\nAfter announcing that Canada would put the new tax in effect on Jan. 8, officials here were critical of President Reagan's decision to impose a bridging levy of 15 percent on the Canadian imports until the new tax takes effect. A senior official in Ottawa, speaking on a background basis, called the President's action ''a bit of greed and haste.''\nBeyond all this, opponents of the deal said that it cast a pall over the Mulroney Government's initiative to liberalize the rules governing trade between the two countries, the world's largest trading partners.\nThe broad trade initiative, explored in talks that began last May, have run into major obstacles that have raised doubts about the prospects for an accord before a September 1987 deadline set by Congress. Hostile Feelings\nThe trade tensions have generated hostile feelings among many Canadians who generally are well disposed toward the United States.\nEven Mr. Mulroney, whose Government's fortunes rest heavily on the attempt to negotiate a broad trade deal with Washington, has spoken about his doubts that the United States appreciates ''its friends.''\nThe Mulroney administration had been buffeted by a United States decision in May to impose a stiff tariff on Canadian cedar shakes and shingles, a major British Columbia export, and had retaliated with a range of tariffs on American imports as varied as computer parts and Christmas trees.\nThen, in October, Canada slapped a countervailing duty of about 70 percent on American corn imports, saying that United States farm policies amounted to unfair subsidization. U.S. APPLAUDS PACT\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (Special To The New York Times) - Reagan Administration officials applauded the agreement with Canada that ended the often contentious lumber dispute, which had threatened to derail broader free trade negotiations between the two countries.\n''We commend the negotiators on both sides of the border,'' said S. Bruce Smart Jr., Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade administration.\n''The solution successfully addresses the problem,'' added Alan Woods, deputy United States trade representative.
180	'ALTAR OF PEACE' DEDICATED AT CATHEDRAL	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D9113FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A longtime dream for the woodworker George Nakashima was realized last night when his ''Altar for Peace,'' a heart-shaped work in English walnut and rosewood, was dedicated at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.\nA longtime dream for the woodworker George Nakashima was realized last night when his ''Altar for Peace,'' a heart-shaped work in English walnut and rosewood, was dedicated at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.\n''We had a fair amount of difficulty transporting it - it was a wide load,'' the 81-year-old master woodworker said of the three-quarter-ton altar, which made the trip from his workshop in Bucks County, Pa., to the cathedral on a 40-foot flatbed truck.\nAbout 5,000 people gathered in the cathedral on New Year's Eve, where they heard the blessing and dedication of the altar as part of the cathedral's fourth annual Concert for Peace.\nHeralded by trumpets and shrouded in incense, Mr. Nakashima joined a procession through the cathedral to the nave, where the altar had been placed.\nIn his remarks, Mr. Nakashima said that the symbolic genesis of the altar ''was perhaps a thousand years ago in Japan, the time when the great forests with huge trees existed and the spirit of union of man and nature was deep and real.''\nHaving heard that the vast Gothic space was a bit drafty, Mr. Nakashima, was atypically clad in a three-piece suit rather than his traditional Japanese wrapped coat.\nMr. Nakashima, who said earlier that he intended the altar as a ''tangible'' symbol for the peace movement, told the crowd ''if we can contribute something to the stability of this world, it would be fulfilling.''\nFinanced largely by Mr. Nakashima, the altar, which cost about $10,000, is the final chapter of a saga that began three years ago, when one of Mr. Nakashima's loggers procured the tree from a Long Island estate. It took a week to cut the log with an eight-foot chain saw.\nAfter two years of air and kiln drying the logs, Mr. Nakashima spent another two and a half months building the altar, which was carefully planed and sanded and then finished with Mr. Nakashima's trademark butterfly rosewood inlays.\nThe altar, on top of which rests a bonsai tree, is flanked by two menorahs, a Moslem prayer rug and two Shinto vases, in keeping with the cathedral's mission as ''a house of prayer for all nations.'' Also dedicated last night was an eternal flame from Hiroshima and a 14-foot painted cross by Carlos Sanchez Arias entitled ''The Crucifixion of Nicaragua.''\nThe concert itself featured a prayer read by the actress Ellen Burstyn and remarks by the conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein, who gave a rendition of his own seasonal satirical rap song, ''Gift Wrap.''\n''Let us commit ourselves, yet once again, to the vision of racial harmony and justice in this city,'' the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, the Dean of the Cathedral, said in a special prayer for peace. ''We know by now where such discord can lead. We know by now that we must overcome. We must be one people in the city of New York. Let this be a special message from this gathering to our fellow New Yorkers on this New Year's Eve.''
181	BORN IN '00, THEY AWAIT NEW YEAR	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D8113FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: It's been quite a century, so far, for Lucia Radl, Mabel Brown, Arthur Linksz, Annie Flanagan and Meyer Greenberg.\nIt's been quite a century, so far, for Lucia Radl, Mabel Brown, Arthur Linksz, Annie Flanagan and Meyer Greenberg.\nEach intends to turn 87 years old in 1987. And having survived it all since 1900, each can claim - perhaps more than most Americans - a certain proprietary right to the 20th century. Not that it has been easy. As they looked back on what has been wrought in their time, they turned to words bearing the weight of great upheaval - revolution, world wars, a Great Depression, a Holocaust, civil rights, women's liberation. They have seen it all - the automobile, the airplane, radio, television, the computer, the hydrogen bomb and the space age.\n''Resilient,'' said Dr. Radl, a Manhattan psychiatrist, when asked how she faced what she had to face. ''How can you survive if you are not resilient?'' 'Get Me a Bottle of Rum'\nAnd yesterday afternoon, Miss Brown, who lives in Harlem, knew exactly how she would face the start of another New Year. ''Going to get me a bottle of rum and just be right here in my house,'' she said. ''Going to sit up until they drop the ball. And when they do I'll jump up, shout 'Hallelujah,' clap hands and thank God for me being here.''\nFor Dr. Linksz, a retired Manhattan ophthalmologist who has written two books since turning 80, it all began in a time of crowned heads, prancing steeds and gilt-edged coaches. ''The years from 1900 to 1914, they were the last years of the Hapsburg monarchy,'' said Dr. Linksz, who grew up in a tiny town on the plains of Hungary. ''The peasant still tilled the soil. And optimism was great. But it turned out to be not justified. ''There were great expectations,'' he said. ''Technical progress was supposed to be the salvation of mankind.'' That, he said, was long before the Nazis perfected the technology of mass murder and, among the millions, killed many members of his family.\nDr. Linksz recalled the advent of the airplane. ''Only the angels were supposed to fly,'' he said. ''Nobody expected that the first airplane would mean so much change, but it did. My father would say that each night the soul flies into God's lap. That's what we knew about flying.''\nIn all her years, Mrs. Flanagan ''has never been on a plane. And I never drove a car.'' She was too young then, she said, and too old now. ''In them days, most people didn't have cars.''\nMrs. Flanagan, who now lives in Flushing, Queens, came to the United States in 1921 from County Mayo, Ireland. ''There was 10 children in my family,'' she said, ''but, of course, there was 10 to 12 in every family. There wasn't enough jobs to go around, so this was the best country to come to.''\nMrs. Flanagan remembers ''the uprising of 1916. It was against the British. It was always against the British. There was always fighting there, you get used to it.''\nCannon echo in the memory of Dr. Radl. ''I was born in Odessa, Russia, on the Black Sea,'' she said. ''In 1905, I experienced the bombardment of Odessa by the ship, Potemkin. The sailors had started a revolution'' - a hint of the overthrow of the Czars to come - ''but it was not successful.\n''We lived through the revolution and the First World War,'' Dr. Radl said. ''I heard and saw the fighting in the street. I was 18. Too much war and revolution and killing.''\nMr. Greenberg came uncomfortably close to war during his decades as a merchant seaman. He worked on the convoys crossing the Atlantic during both world wars.\nMr. Greenberg grew up, and still lives, in Brooklyn. ''I remember the gangsters that congregated around the Brooklyn Navy Yard,'' he said. ''They played cards and they wore big diamond rings all polished up meticulously. I remember all the speakeasies and the bootlegging; the smuggling across Gravesend Bay in fast speedboats, bringing in liquor.'' His life at sea ''was hard,'' Mr. Greenberg said, ''because the unions were weak at that time. Oh, is it hard work - handling heavy owsers and wire cables to tie up the vessel.''\nAnd, during the wars, it was frightening. ''I went across with the big convoys,'' he said. ''A hundred or more ships carrying the vehicles, the ammunition and the troops. We were always suspicious of submarines underneath, aircraft overhead. We had ashcans on the stern of the vessel, filled with bombs, depth charges.''\nIt was just luck, he said, that kept him safe. ''At Murmansk,'' he said - referring to the Soviet port where Allied aid was off-loaded - ''the submarines were picking off the merchant ships one after another.''\nBetween the wars, Dr. Radl, who came to the United States in 1939, fought another kind of battle. ''In 1920, I was studying medicine,'' she said. ''I chose a male-dominated profession. In a way, I was a pioneer. 'You Better Be a Cook'\n''Later on, when I was a doctor, if I wanted to be in the operating room, they pushed me away. Even when I came here to the United States, and I went for financial help, they said, 'We have enough doctors, you better be a cook.' I said, 'No way, this is what I'm going to be.' ''\nMiss Brown, meanwhile, was fighting a somewhat similar battle. ''Yes indeed,'' she said, when asked whether there was racism - even lynchings - when she was a small girl in Macon, Ga. ''The white people down there, you worked for them, but don't get in their way and don't say nothing wrong. If you say something wrong, they kill you just like they kill a cat.\n''You have to say, 'Yes, Ma'am' and 'No, Ma'am,' '' Miss Brown said. ''But I never said 'Yes, Ma'am' and 'No, Ma'am' to none of them, because I didn't think they were no better than me. That's right.''\nMrs. Flanagan, who worked as a domestic for most of her years in America, said she thought New York ''was much nicer years go.'' Neighborliness was evident, she said, when someone on the block came home with one of those big, cardboard crates. ''Not everyone had a television then,'' Mrs. Flanagan said. ''I remember, we used to go to other people's houses.'' Back then, she said, ''There was no robberies, no killings. There was no such thing as locking doors.''\nStill, at almost 87, Mrs. Flanagan has much to be happy about. ''My grandchildren, they keep me going,'' she said. ''I'm living my life over again with them. You don't sit home worrying about your pains. They make you laugh.'' Mr. Greenberg keeps himself young by ''doing all the good I can for other people. In so doing I help myself,'' he said. ''The Lord loves that.'' And Dr. Radl remains ''an optimist.'' ''I hope that there will be survival in spite of the nuclear age,'' she said. ''We don't need so much upheaval.''
182	REAGAN PLANS TO ASK CONGRESS TO RESTORE CONTRIBUTION TO U.N.	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D8113FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: President Reagan has told Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that he will ask Congress to restore millions of dollars in financial cuts that pushed the United Nations close to bankruptcy, United Nations and American officials said today.\nPresident Reagan has told Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that he will ask Congress to restore millions of dollars in financial cuts that pushed the United Nations close to bankruptcy, United Nations and American officials said today.\nAccording to the officials, Mr. Reagan spoke to Mr. Perez de Cuellar after praising organizational changes recently adopted by the General Assembly, which included giving the major donor nations a bigger voice in United Nations spending. Mr. Reagan's comments, which he made nine days ago, were made public today at the United Nations.\n''The United Nations took an historic step to adopt sweeping reforms of its organization and methods of operation,'' Mr. Reagan said.\nNoting that his Administration had long pushed for such changes, the President added, ''We are very pleased that these measures have finally been adopted.''\nUnited Nations officials say they regard Mr. Reagan's statement as the clearest indication of the Administration's support for the United Nations in the aftermath of extensive Congressional budget cuts that plunged the organization into the worst financial crisis of its 41-year history.\nThe United States owes the United Nations $110 million of its $210 million assessment for 1986, or more than 10 percent of the United Nations budget of $800 million. Congress cited the need for organizational change as justification for the cuts.\nThe resolution passed by the Assembly included a key demand of the United States: that the big donors have a larger voice in deciding how the United Nations spends its money. To accomplish this goal, it gives the 21-nation Committee for Program and Coordination a key role in preparing the budget.\nThe committee will now receive budget proposals a year in advance, set a ceiling on the budget, decide on its content and set a limit on appropriations that could be later added on by the Assembly. All of these decisions are supposed to be made unanimously, or by consensus.\nThis would give each of the committee members a veto, and thus more power to major donors like the United States represented on the committee. Until now, each of the 159 member states of the Assembly had one vote on budget matters. 'Has Not Gone Unnoticed'\nThe chief United Nations spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said of Mr. Reagan's statement: ''This is the most positive statement of support for the U.N. to come out of the Reagan Administration. We're delighted to see that the genuine effort at reform has not gone unnoticed.''\nSecretary General Perez de Cuellar, who has sharply criticized the Reagan Administration for what he said was the failure to pay its dues and the breaking of its commitment to live up to the United Nations Charter, also praised Mr. Reagan's statement today. ''I am satisfied with the positive reaction of the U.S. Administration,'' Mr. Giuliani quoted the Secretary General as saying. ''I'm counting on the efforts of the Administration to obtain the necessary funding for the United Nations.''\nOne American official said that after the Assembly approved the package of organizational changes, ''There was a sea change in attitudes'' in the Administration.\nPresident Reagan was pleased by the changes, and he telephoned Mr. Perez de Cuellar on Dec. 22 to congratulate him on the package, which was unanimously adopted by the General Assembly three days earlier after months of often bitter closed-door debate.\n''Mr. Reagan expressed satisfaction at what had happened during the General Assembly,'' Mr. Perez de Cuellar said. ''He said he hoped it would enable him to go to Congress to obtain necessary funds.'' Warm Welcome by Bush\nIn addition, when the General Assembly President, Humayun Rasheed Choudhury of Bangladesh, visited Washington on Dec. 22, he was warmly received by Vice President Bush, who expressed appreciation for his efforts in pushing through the package, said Richard C. Hottelet, chief spokesman at the United States Mission.\nIn his statement, Mr. Reagan greeted the changes as a key mechanism for strengthening the United Nations, which both the Administration and Congress have repeatedly criticized for fiscal irresponsibility, a bloated bureaucracy and anti-Americanism.\n''These reforms are designed to strengthen the organization's effectiveness and efficiency in carrying out its important political, economic and social objectives,'' Mr. Reagan said.

The state's pension funds now hold $797 million worth of stock in 12 American companies with operations in Northern Ireland.\nWhat may have the greatest effect on New Yorkers' pocketbooks is $1.65 billion in tax relief, the third phase of a state tax cut enacted in 1985. Under the law, the maximum rate on earned income will drop to 9 percent from 9.5 percent. The personal exemption increases to $900 from $850.\nThe Legislature and Mr. Cuomo are expected to struggle during the year over how to return an expected windfall of state revenues that will result from changes in the Federal tax laws.\nThe Governor's office has estimated the windfall between $1.2 billion and $2 billion, while the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, has put the amount closer to $2.4 billion.\nAnother state agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles, will charge drivers of all-terrain vehicles a $10 annual registration fee and a $3.25 one-time license plate fee.\nNew Yorkers needing medical assistance will have the right to inspect and obtain copies of records in doctors' offices, hospital charts, X-ray results and laboratory and diagnostic tests. Most hospitals and doctors have not made a patient's medical records available. The new law does not apply to patients in psychiatric hospitals, institutions for the mentally disabled and alcohol and drug treatment.\nThe are among other new laws that start today:\n* Consumers who sign dating service contracts will be able to cancel within three business days.\n* Employers and their insurance companies who intentionally try to delay hearings on workers' compensation claims face mandatory fines of $100 for each hearing delay.\n* Motorists who pass stopped school buses where children are boarding or leaving face stiffer fines and longer jail terms.\n* Hotels, motels and lodging houses are required, effective Jan. 17, to make available smoke-detecting devices that warn deaf and hearing-impaired guests.\n* Leashed dogs approved by the State Department of Environmental Conservation will be allowed to track down dead or wounded deer and bears at the start of the 1987 hunting season.

He was 90 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.\nAlan Harrison Temple, a leading private economist and banker who retired as vice chairman of the First National City Bank of New York in 1961, died last Thursday at the King Street Home in Rye Brook, N.Y. He was 90 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.\nAs vice chairman of the board of trustees of Columbia University, he also was deeply involved in meeting the challenge posed by the campus unrest of 1968. He headed a special trustee committee whose recommendations resulted in the first revision of the university's charter since 1810.\nFor most of his tenure at the bank, now known as Citibank, Mr. Temple was the guiding light of its Monthly Letter on Business and Economic Conditions. Started in 1904 as a modest throwaway for customers interested in Treasury securities, it grew after World War II into an influential authority on the American economy. Honored by Journalism Alumni\nBy 1955 the letter reached nearly 250,000 people, many important decision-makers, in 116 countries. The following year the alumni association of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism honored him with an award for distinguished service. A 1917 graduate of from Columbia College, he had majored in journalism.\nMr. Temple, a native of Templeville, Md., joined what was then the then National City Bank of New York in 1931 as assistant statistician after managing and editing the publication Commerce & Finance for 12 years. He was promoted to the post of bank statistician a year later.\nHe became a vice president in 1941 and, as the bank's economist, rose to executive vice president in 1952. His position made him the bank's senior officer in charge of the economics department and the monthly newsletter.\nHe retired after five years as a director and three years as vice chairman but continued in several other corporate directorships with the bank. In 1963, the bank recalled him to serve on its board of trustees and investment policy committee. Influential Role at Columbia\nMr. Temple was a past chairman of the National Economic Conference Board. He was elected a trustee at Columbia in 1959 and became a trustee, as well as secretary and treasurer, at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1961.\nThe Columbia campus, like some other campuses on both sides of the Atlantic, erupted in unrest the spring of 1968, culminating in a long sit-in. Mr. Temple had planned to retire as a trustee that year, but amid the campus disorder, the board asked him, as vice chairman, to form a special study panel on restructuring the university.\nMr. Temple is survived by a son, Alan H. Jr. of Pittsford, N.Y.; two daughters, Anne Temple Crumm of Cambridge, Mass., and Nancy Temple Hammond of Fairfield, Conn.; 11 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren.
185	SANTUCCI IS SAID TO WEIGH GIVING CASE TO THE U.S.	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D7113FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Queens District Attorney John J. Santucci, who has been stymied in his efforts to prosecute the Howard Beach case, is considering asking Federal authorities to take on the death of Michael Griffith as a civil-rights violation, city law-enforcement officals said yesterday.\nQueens District Attorney John J. Santucci, who has been stymied in his efforts to prosecute the Howard Beach case, is considering asking Federal authorities to take on the death of Michael Griffith as a civil-rights violation, city law-enforcement officals said yesterday.\nThey said Mr. Santucci was considering this step because it would be easier to gather evidence and convict the defendants under Federal law than state law.\nMr. Griffith, a black man, was struck and killed by a car on the Shore Parkway in Howard Beach on Dec. 20 after he fled a gang of white youths who had beaten him and two other blacks, according to the police.\nThe man Mr. Santucci has called the key witness in the case, Cedric Sandiford, Mr. Griffith's stepfather, was also beaten. Mr. Sandiford's lawyer has said the witness would not cooperate with Mr. Santucci's office because its investigation was in bad faith and included a cover-up, a charge the prosecutor and other city officials deny. Ease of Prosecution\nThe lawyer, Alton H. Maddox Jr., at a meeting with reporters yesterday in Brooklyn, said Mr. Sandiford would cooperate with a Federal investigation of the case, just as he would with an inquiry by a special state prosecutor appointed by the Governor - an appointment called for by the lawyers.\nUnder Federal civil-rights law, it would be easier to prosecute the three white teen-agers who now face reckless endangerment charges in the attack, as well as others who might be charged, in view of Mr. Sandiford's lack of cooperation, said the city law-enforcement officials, who declined to be identified. They said this was so because Federal immunity and conspiracy laws make it easier to gain and use the testimony of accomplices in the crime than state laws do.\nThe officials further said that the penalties for a Federal civil-rights conviction in a case in which the violation caused a death could be up to life in prison, the same maximum as for a murder conviction under the New York State penal code.\nAlthough the officials did not say so, a Federal prosecution would permit Mr. Santucci to extricate himself from a situation in which he has been unable to move forward on an emotional case that has captured the city's attention. Murder, manslaughter and assault charges Mr. Santucci's office brought against the three arrested teen-agers were thrown out by a Queens judge Monday.\nThe judge, Ernest Bianchi of Criminal Court in Queens, acted after finding that the evidence that prosecutors presented at a hearing, at which Mr. Sandiford did not testify, was insufficient to sustain those charges and sufficient only to sustain charges of reckless endangerment.\nCity law-enforcement authorities also said that if the Federal prosecutors took over the case and sought Mr. Sandiford's cooperation, it would put his lawyer, Alton H. Maddox Jr., under ''great pressure'' to advise his client to cooperate with the Federal inquiry.\nMr. Maddox and another lawyer working with him, C. Vernon Mason, could not immediately be reached for comment on the report that Mr. Santucci was considering requesting a Federal civil-rights prosecution.\nThe reports came late yesterday afternoon, after the lawyers had held a news conference on the case in Brooklyn. They have been calling for Governor Cuomo to appoint a special state prosecutor to take over the case. No Confirmation\nMr. Santucci's office declined to confirm that he was considering asking for a Federal civil-rights prosecution.\nAides to Mr. Santucci who declined to be identified said he would still prefer to have his office prosecute the case. They said Mr. Santucci still hoped Mr. Sandiford and his lawyer would change their mind and cooperate with the office so that it might seek to have a grand jury reinstate the murder, manslaughter and assault charges that Judge Bianchi dismissed.\nWithout Mr. Sandiford, Mr. Santucci's aides have insisted, their chance of obtaining an indictment on those charges, let alone a conviction, remains slim.\nCity law-enforcement officials said Mr. Santucci's office could proceed with a state prosecution even after Federal authorities began a prosecution of their own, but the city officials noted that problems of double jeopardy could then be encountered.\nThe chief assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Laurence Urgenson, whose office would prosecute a Federal civil rights case, said Federal authorities had made no decision yet on whether to ''go ahead with a Federal case.''\nHe said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had begun a ''preliminary investigation'' into the assault and Mr. Griffith's highway death and that his office had ''been in touch'' with Mr. Santucci's office during the last week. But he said neither Mr. Santucci nor his aides had asked for a Federal prosecution and that ''it would be premature'' to conclude that it would be easier to prosecute this case under Federal civil rights statutes than under state criminal laws.\nHe said the F.B.I. began its inquiry at the request of the Justice Department's civil rights division in Washington, which made the request on the basis of news reports of the case.\nRegarding conspiracy law, the city officials said, an accomplice's testimony must be corroborated by other evidence - testimony by a nonaccomplice or physical evidence - if it is to be used in a state prosecution, whereas it need not be corroborated to be used in a Federal prosecution.

''There are radios blasting all the time,'' Mr. Bateza said. ''Guys are fighting. Some of them are crazy.''\nAnd there is no way to get breakfast before 7 A.M., or to accept late-night overtime without risking the loss of his bed.\nIn a new shelter in Brooklyn, the city is trying to make it is easier for homeless men to hold down jobs -often the first step toward getting out of the shelter system. These days, Mr. Bateza, who is a bicycle messenger, can get cereal, juice and coffee at 5 A.M. He can ask an aide to make sure he is up on time. He can call in and explain if he wants to work overtime. Responsibility Is Goal\nHe and about 100 others who have jobs are living in a shelter at the former Greenpoint Hospital, at 300 Skillman Avenue, at Kingsland Avenue, in the Greenpoint section. They are participating in a program intended to help them keep their jobs and, within 90 days, find housing on their own.\n''The concept is to make them feel special and at the same time get them to take responsibility for their lives,'' said Sylvia Castaneda, who has been running the program since it began last October.\nTo get into the program, the men must sign a contract agreeing among other things to put half their salaries into a savings account and attend workshops on personal hygiene, how to keep a job, how to look for an apartment and how to budget money.\nIf the men lose their jobs or do not find a place to live by then, they must return to other shelters.\nSince the program started, 45 men have moved out, 19 to known addresses - what Ms. Castaneda considers a clear success. Of the 26 others, a few were sent to other shelters because they refused to follow the rules. But most lost their jobs. An Experiment, for Now\n''They can come back,'' Ms. Castaneda said, ''as soon as they get it together.''\nIf the shelter proves effective, officials of the city's Human Resources Administration said, the program will be expanded and offered to homeless women and families.\nWith its yellow-tiled walls and linoleum floors, the shelter is far from cozy, but life here is more pleasant than in most shelters, the men there say. The rooms are quite small, but, even without doors, they offer some privacy. And, because all the men must have daytime work to get in the program, there is little noise at night.\nBest of all, the men say, they feel far safer segregated from the homeless who do not have jobs - men, they say, who are more likely to steal or be mentally ill.\n''If you want to get it together, you can do it here,'' said Mr. Bateza, who is 26 years old and has struggled with a drug problem for several years.\nSome of the men in the program have been in shelters for as long as two years, holding jobs off and on. Others have been homeless for just a few months.\nMost are in their 20's or 30's and work as messengers, security guards and drivers of delivery trucks, earning the mininum wage of $3.35 an hour, and trying to save enough money to put down a rent deposit and buy furniture. Working 35 hours a week at the minimum wage, they would be required to save about $55 a week. Lies to Keep Jobs\nIn the meantime, most of the men say that they must lie about where they are living or risk loosing their jobs. For that reason, many did not want their names used.\nA few said they had turned to the shelter system, because the housing they could afford was usually in such bad repair and in such dangerous neighborhoods that the shelters were no worse.\n''Some of these rooms, you might as well be in a shelter,'' said Antonio Rivera, who has already saved $1,200 over the last few months and intends to go to Puerto Rico soon to make a new start. ''People break into those rooms like crazy.''\nMr. Bateza said that in the large shelters he had been unable to force himself to save. ''You're living rent free,'' he said. ''You got no responsibility, you tend to just go out on pay day and spend.''\nSome turned to the program because they hoped the additional supervision and care would help them help themselves.\nSince there are only about 100 men in the program, the staff knows almost everybody and can prod those who need it to keep appointments and follow the shelter's rules.\nMs. Castaneda, a woman who is quick to laugh and just as quick to dress down a 200-pound man who has been rude, spends a good deal of time reminding the men to look for apartments or keep appointments.\n''Sometimes,'' she says, ''these guys are like children. They want the attention.''

A small fee imposed Dec. 1 on most imported goods, along with rising calls for protectionist legislation, were partly responsible for the renewed deterioration by causing a strong rush in imports. But analysts expressed keen disappointment with the data, which put the trade gap at $159.1 billion for the first 11 months of the year, eclipsing the previous record of $148.5 billion for 1985.

Politicians also attacked the accord, which applies to Canadian exports worth about $2.9 billion. The dispute had threatened broader U.S.-Canada trade talks. [ 41. ] Companies\nI.B.M. and Merrill Lynch ended a once-promising venture in computerizing the financial services industry. The failure appeared to be a setback for both companies, which had staked millions of dollars on the highly publicized International Marketnet, which joins a long list of information services that have failed.

Lester, one of three defendants in the Howard Beach incident, was released from the Rikers Island jail yesterday after posting $25,000 bail.\nThe other two defendants, Scott Kern, 17 years old, and Jason Ladone, 16, both of Howard Beach, Queens, were freed on bail Monday after murder and assault charges against the three youths were dismissed. They still face reckless endangerment charges.\nA spokesman for the City Department of Correction, James Whitford, said Mr. Lester, 17 of Ozone Park, left the jail about 3 P.M. Mr. Whitford could not say if the sum was paid in cash or by bond, which would have required an action by a judge.\nMr. Lester's attorney, Bryan Fielder Levinson, said yesterday that neighbors had started a fund for his defense.\n''I understand there are some people trying to help his mother out with legal fees and bail,'' he said.\nThe lawyer said he did not know Mr. Lester's whereabouts.\nMr. Levinson said he did not believe the beating of three blacks by a gang of white youths in Howard Beach Dec. 20 was a racial incident.\n''This was a confrontation, but it was blown up that way,'' Mr. Levinson said. ''If you had a situation where blacks came into the neighborhood and someone said 'Let's attack the blacks,' that's a racial incident. But if two groups get into a confrontation, and they call each other names, that's just people. Some do it and some don't. But the cause is a confrontation.''

His school, Texas-Arlington, played Lousiana Tech for the Southland Conference championship. ''We lost,'' he said, ''34-blank.''\nThe last big game Tim McKyer remembered was in 1984. His school, Texas-Arlington, played Lousiana Tech for the Southland Conference championship. ''We lost,'' he said, ''34-blank.''\nDon Griffin's last big game was last year. His school, Middle Tennessee State, beat Akron for the Ohio Valley Conference championship.\n''But I don't remember the score,'' he said.\nSuch are the humble beginnings of the San Francisco 49ers' starting cornerbacks - rookies, roommates, each from a small school where he played safety, each about to play in the next biggest game of his life - a National Conference division playoff game Sunday in Giants Stadium against the Giants.\nSix months ago, McKyer and Griffin were little more than 6-foot, 176-pound question marks that Coach Bill Walsh and his staff thought might develop. McKyer was taken on the third round of the college draft, Griffin on the sixth.\n''McKyer had good speed and quickness,'' said George Seifert, the 49ers' defensive coordinator. ''We liked him as a cover man. Griffin was one of those guys you figure, maybe he will, maybe he won't make the team, and where we drafted him, he probably shouldn't have.''\nBoth players developed to such a degree that McKyer started every game at left cornerback, Griffin all but one at right cornerback. Walsh called them ''the two best rookies at their positions'' in the National Football League. Aware of Inexperience\nWhether they are or they aren't is now of less importance than how they perform against the Giants, who were well aware of their limited experience five weeks ago in their 21-17 victory over the 49ers in Candlestick Park. Phil Simms had his best game of the season with 27 completions for 388 yards, but he is best remembered more for engineering three touchdown drives within 11 minutes of the third quarter, which began with the 49ers leading, 17-0.\nMcKyer and Griffin remember only too well what Simms did. Stacy Robinson beat McKyer for a 34-yard touchdown pass that cut the lead to 17-14, and on the next series, he beat Griffin for a 49-yard completion at the 49ers' 1-yard line. One play later, the Giants led, 21-17.\nMcKyer erred in judgment and allowed Robinson to get by him. Simms said after the game, ''I just caught the guy sleeping.'' And the other day at his news conference, Walsh noted that McKyer ''let up because he didn't think the ball was going to be thrown to his side.''\n''I felt like dirt,'' McKyer said today, recalling the touchdown pass. Griffin Less Distressed\nGriffin was less distressed over the play he was involved in. He had covered Robinson well; Robinson simply made a great catch.\nAnyway, it is not a cornerback's nature to dwell on the negative. He can't, and the good ones don't. In that respect, McKyer and Griffin are fortunate in that as roommates, they commiserate with each other, ''get each other going,'' as McKyer said.\nMoreover, they have history on their side: The 49ers won their first of two Super Bowls in 1981 with three rookie defensive backs - Ronnie Lott and Eric Wright at the corners and Carlton Williamson at strong safety. Dwight Hicks was the veteran of the group, a third-year player at free safety.\nThis season, Lott, who led the league in interceptions with 10, has played at free safety. Wright has missed every game but one with a groin injury. Williamson has started every game at strong safety. Hicks never reported because of a contract dispute and was released. Later in the year, he signed with the Indianapolis Colts.\nNeither McKyer nor Griffin had any idea the season would turn out this way for them. McKyer came into training camp only trying to make the team, figuring ''I had a 50-50 chance.''\n''But they had a position open,'' he said. ''I thought, with hard work, who knows?''\n''I really didn't know about my future,'' said Griffin. ''I felt if I could do the job, do well, work hard, I could make the team. As for starting, I just didn't know.'' Amazed at Rookies\nSeifert is fairly amazed at how well they have played as rookies, handling new positions, the pressure of a division race and the added attention playoff teams seem to generate.\n''You also have to consider their backgrounds,'' he said. ''Eric, Ronnie and Dwight were all from big schools. They were used to big games, big crowds. And our system then was just developing; it was much less complicated than it is now. These guys have come in here at 7:30 three mornings a week from day one to look at films. They're still doing it.'' They feel as if they have to. The 1986 team has matched the 1981 team only by winning the division. At the moment, the current group is three victories away from a league championship.\n''We know all about the 1981 team,'' McKyer said. ''They did as a young team. It would be nice if we could, too.'' N.F.L. PLAYOFFS

Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason - made separate statements. They answered seven questions before leaving the church and declining further interviews. Neither of their clients, Cedric Sandiford and Timothy Grimes, was at the church.\nThe church was the site of the funeral for the third victim of the attack, Michael Griffith, who was struck and killed by a car on Shore Parkway after he fled from a group of white youths, according to the police. Mr. Griffith's mother, Jean, attended the lawyers' session with reporters yesterday, as did her sons Christopher and Anthony.\nThese are the principal assertions made yesterday by Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason and reponses from the authorities: The Inquiry The lawyers said that Mr. Sandiford had cooperated fully with prosecutors and detectives for three days, and that he had refused to do so only after prosecutors demanded that he view a lineup of potential suspects.\nMr. Sandiford, the lawyers said, had told prosecutors he was unable to do so because he was suffering from serious eye injuries that impaired his vision. ''Nobody would ask a blind man to view a lineup unless he was conducting a bad-faith investigation,'' Mr. Maddox said.\nA spokesman for Mr. Santucci, Thomas McCarthy, said the District Attorney was aware of Mr. Sandiford's vision problems. Two days after the attack, Mr. McCarthy said, Mr. Sandiford told prosecutors that his eyesight had improved and that he then had agreed to attend a lineup. Later that same day, according to Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Maddox told prosecutors that he was representing Mr. Sandiford and that his client was unable to view the lineup.\n'' We would never demand he view a lineup when he was indicating difficulties with his vision,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''Since Mr. Maddox entered the case we have not heard directly from Mr. Sandiford.''\nThe lawyers also contended that the District Attorney's office had failed to obtain statements on videotape from the three teen-agers who detectives said admitted participating in the assaults.\nMr. McCarthy said videotaped statements are normally obtained after a suspect is identified in a lineup. ''Because Mr. Sandiford did not participate in a lineup we never got to the videotaping stage,'' he said. The Assault The lawyers said that after Mr. Sandiford was beaten by white youths, he was mistreated by white police officers and detectives who strip searched him, mistreated him and threatened to file criminal charges against him.\nAlice T. McGillion, the deputy police commissioner for public information, said Mr. Sandiford was ''absolutely not'' strip searched. She said he was routinely ''frisked'' for weapons, but that he was not treated like a criminal. ''He was definitely treated like a victim,'' Ms. McGillion said.\nAccording to Ms. McGillion, both black and white detectives were assigned to the investigation. She said yesterday that personnel files were not immediately available for a breakdown on the number of white and black investigators assigned to the case.\nThe lawyers said Mr. Sandiford told police officers and detectives that a car that had chased the three black men in the streets drove onto to the highway and struck and killed Mr. Griffith. Ms. McGillion said that Mr. Sandiford at first told the police that he had not seen the car strike Mr. Griffith. According to Ms. McGillion, Mr. Sandiford said he believed he had heard the impact of the accident.\nMr. Sandiford also said, according to Ms. McGillion, that after Mr. Griffith had been run over, Mr. Sandiford saw on the highway a dark-colored car that had earlier chased the victims, Ms. McGillion said.\nMr. McCarthy said Mr. Sandiford never told the police or prosecutors that he had seen the car strike Mr. Griffith.\nThe lawyers said that the car that struck Mr. Griffith, driven by Dominick Blum, a 24-year-old city court officer, resembled the car that chased the three men on the streets of Howard Beach. The lawyers said Mr. Blum's car was not impounded, no photographs were taken of it and that Mr. Blum was not arrested for leaving the scene of an accident.\nMs. McGillion said detectives have evidence that Mr. Blum was not involved in the street attack on the victims. She said Mr. Blum's car was not impounded because all of the forensic evidence, including paint scrapings and photographs, was taken.\nOther police officials have said Mr. Blum was not arrested because he returned an hour after the accident to the scene. Under normal police policy, drivers who return to the scene and volunteer statements are not arrested, officials said. Mr. Blum, according to the police, said he at first believed his car had struck an animal or tire on the road.\nAccording to authorities, Mr. Blum could be indicted later by a grand jury or charged by the police for leaving the scene. The Evidence The lawyers said no photographs of Mr. Sandiford's head and eye injuries were taken after the assault for possible use later as evidence. Ms. McGillion said such photos were taken on the night of the incident.\nThe lawyers said that on the afternoon after the death, Mr. Grimes was picked up and kept in a room for two hours by detectives at the 106th Precinct station house in Queens. But, the lawyers said he was not questioned that day or afterward about the assault.\nMs. McGillion said Mr. Grimes was questioned by the police but said he declined to give investigators an address of a woman that he and the two other victims had been visiting in St. Albans, Queens, before their car broke down.\nChristopher Griffith, the brother of Michael Griffith, said at the church meeting yesterday that on the afternoon after the death of Michael, detectives from the 106th Precinct picked up Mr. Sandiford at their home in the East New York section of Brooklyn for questioning. Mr. Sandiford is the stepfather of the Griffith brothers. Mr. Griffith said the detectives did not take notes of what Mr. Sandiford said and listened to a New York Giants-Green Bay Packers football game on the radio as they questioned him.\nThe lawyers cited the questioning as an example of how Mr. Sandiford was mistreated and that the police from the start of the investigation discounted his version of events. Ms. McGillion said she had no information that Mr. Griffith was with Mr. Sandiford while he was being questioned. She also said that she could not verify yesterday whether or not detectives took notes or listened to a football game while questioning Mr. Sandiford. The Hearing Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason said that at the court hearing on Monday when murder charges against the three teen-agers were dismissed, the District Attorney's office did not enter hospital or medical records attesting to Mr. Sandiford's injuries. Mr. McCarthy said that prosecutors did not have the hospital records, and that Mr. Maddox had ''told us you are not going to use that as an excuse of a continuance.''\nAccording to Mr. McCarthy, medical records would not have been relevant for obtaining a postponement of the hearing. Under New York State law, the defendants were entitled to a hearing on the charges against them on Monday because no indictment had been handed down against them by a grand jury.\nThe lawyers, in their statements, said that Mr. Santucci's office had sufficent evidence and witnesses to obtain indictments without Mr. Sandiford's testimony. ''They are making him the hub of the case when he isn't,'' Mr. Mason said. Mr. Sandiford has declined to testify before a grand jury and Mr. Santucci has described his testimony as ''vital.''\nMr. Mason said yesterday that neither he nor Mr. Maddox were receiving fees for representing the two survivors and the Griffith family. Mr. Mason said the lawyers had no plans to file negligence suits against the city because of the racial attacks.\nMr. Maddox's eyes watered and a tear was visible on his left cheek when he recounted having seen Mr. Ward in a television news report on Tuesday suggest that his motive for representing Mr. Sandiford was a fee in a civil suit. ''What Ben Ward said, hurt me more than anything else,'' Mr. Maddox added.\nMr. Griffith's mother declined to answer any questions. Family members and lawyers also refused to provide information about Michael Griffith's background except to say he had been born in Grenada.\nChristopher Griffith said his family had declined an invitation from Mayor Koch to have breakfast at City Hall on Christmas Day in an effort to reduce racial tension. ''The dinner or breakfast I would like him to serve me is justice,'' Mr. Griffith said.\nAt the meeting, the legal strategy and conduct of Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason was endorsed by Assemblyman Albert Vann, a Democrat of Brooklyn, The Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, executive pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Manhattan, the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., executive director of the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, Jitu Weusi, a community activist, and the Rev. Al Sharpton, a community activist.\nIn a prayer before the lawyers spoke, Mr. Chavis, said Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason had been ''scorned and ridiculed because they dared to represent the black families and victims of racial injustice.''

''We worked very hard the last four years, we'll work even harder in the four years ahead.''\nBefore taking his oath of office, Mr. Cuomo, a licensed notary public, swore in his new lieutenant governor, Stan Lundine.\nWhile the two Democrats took their official oaths of office on New Year's Eve to meet requirements of the state constitution, a public inauguration ceremony was to be held on New Year's Day at the Empire State Plaza adjacent to the State Capitol.\nState workers were busy today putting up the last of the red, white and blue bunting for the event. Mr. Cuomo spent some time in the Convention Center hall practicing his speech.\nMr. Cuomo said a few days after his re-election that he was going to begin thinking about running for President. He has yet to announce any decision. Nonetheless, just before the ceremony tonight, aides to the Governor said that he would be traveling to five other states, including Iowa, in the next several months.

The plane, carrying 16 passengers, landed safely, but a New York City man aboard was injured in the shooting.\nA United Airlines jet coming in for a landing at Raleigh-Durham Airport was shot at today. The plane, carrying 16 passengers, landed safely, but a New York City man aboard was injured in the shooting.\nThe New Yorker, Barry Rollins, 30 years old, was hurt by a bullet that pierced the belly of the aircraft, passed through his thigh and lodged in his cheek.\nMr. Rollins was admitted to Rex Hospital in Raleigh, where he was reported in stable condition. Flight 1502, which had taken off from Wilmington, N.C., was 300 feet in the air, south of the airport and about 20 seconds short of touchdown when Mr. Rollins was wounded.\nPvt. Jeff C. Dillard, a Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune, N.C., one of the passengers on the Boeing 737 jet, said in an interview at the airport: ''Somebody shot the plane. It was from outside.''\nA United Airlines spokesman, Kay Lund, said in a telephone interview from Chicago: ''It was one or two miles out when some object, believed to be a bullet, pierced the underside of the aircraft.''\nThe aircraft's landing was not affected by the shooting, Ms. Lund said. ''The pilot wasn't even aware of the incident until he landed.''\nMr. Rollins, wearing black basketball sneakers and a New York Mets jacket, was seated in Seat 16F at a window on the right side of the cabin, behind the wing.\nPrivate Dillard, who was seated two rows behind Mr. Rollins, said he heard a popping sound from the bullet, which left a hole 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter in the side of the plane. He said the bullet passed through Mr. Rollins's right thigh and lodged in his left cheek.\n''I was helping hold a compress on his face,'' Private Dillard said. ''I think he was pretty much in shock as anyone would be.''\nA passenger, George W. Chambers, who was returning home to New York, said a flight attendant asked Mr. Rollins what was wrong. Mr. Rollins replied, ''I don't know,'' Mr. Chambers said.\nPassengers who had planned to remain on Flight 1502 to its next stop, Dulles Airport near Washington, were put aboard another aircraft. The pierced jet was impounded on the runway and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation were called to the airport.\n''We are going over the plane for any evidence,'' said Donald P. Paschall, chief of police at Raleigh-Durham Airport. 'Penetration in the Fuselage'\n''We found penetration in the fuselage shortly behind the wing, and it did go through to where the passenger was sitting,'' Mr. Paschall said. ''We don't know if this was intentional or accidental.''\n''We are looking south of the airport for anything out of the ordinary,'' Mr. Paschall said. Wake County sheriff's deputies and North Carolina Highway Patrol troopers searched roads and wooded areas south of the airport tonight.\nJohn C. Brantley 3d, the airport director, said a similar incident had happened in the area about three years ago when some youngsters fired shotgun pellets into an approaching small airplane.\nThe hole in the exterior of the United jet today was about five feet below the windows behind the wing. A Rex Hospital spokesman said at 8 P.M. that Mr. Rollins had been X-rayed and would undergo surgery ''to clean up his cheek.''\nThe shooting occurred about 5:25 P.M. Mr. Rollins was conscious when emergency medical technicians removed him from the plane, Mr. Paschall said. At 7:30 P.M. a Rex spokesman said Mr. Rollins was alert and had spoken by telephone with his mother.\nSgt. C. M. Cummings of the North Carolina Highway Patrol said, ''It was definitely a bullet.''\nMr. Paschall, when asked if the shot might have been fired by a hunter, said, ''It's a possibility.''

200	23 BLACK LEADERS AND KOCH ATTACK 'PERVASIVE' RACISM	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DC1E3FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Mayor Koch and 23 black leaders agreed at City Hall yesterday to work together to attack what they called ''pervasive and systemic'' racism in the city.\nMayor Koch and 23 black leaders agreed at City Hall yesterday to work together to attack what they called ''pervasive and systemic'' racism in the city.\nSeveral participants called the meeting helpful, with Councilwoman Mary Pinkett of Brooklyn saying that it could help ''defuse'' things in the short run.\nArthur Barnes, the president of the New York Urban Coalition, said that the meeting dealt with ''complex'' issues of race relations and that the participants felt that they had ''by persuasion and the weight of our logic'' convinced the Mayor that improvements were needed. Growing Tension\nTheir remarks came in response to growing tension in New York City over a racial attack in Howard Beach, Queens, on Dec. 20. One of the victims, Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old black man, was struck by a car and died.\nOn Monday, murder charges against three whites accused in the attack were dropped for insufficient evidence after another black victim of the attack refused to testify.\nThe black leaders said yesterday that it was not their intent to take sides in the emerging debate over the investigation or the role that witnesses and lawyers have taken.\nEarlier yesterday, in an emotional meeting with reporters at a Brooklyn church, lawyers for the two surviving black victims criticized not only some of the blacks who were to meet with Mr. Koch but also the police and prosecutors who have been investigating the case. One of those at the church meeting, the Rev. Al Sharpton, derisively called the City Hall meeting ''a coon show.'' 'A New Lynch Mob'\n''What we have in this situation is this,'' said one of the lawyers, Alton H. Maddox Jr. ''The Mayor, the Police Department, the Queens District Attorney's Office, the Police Commissioner and some of our Negro leadership have all formed a new lynch mob. And they are hounding and chasing the messengers for speaking the truth. We have a lynch mob that is running loose in New York City.''\nMr. Maddox and another lawyer for the black victims, C. Vernon Mason, also said that their clients had stopped cooperating with the Queens District Attorney's office because prosecutors ''were making a case'' for the white defendants.\nPoint by point, Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason sought to show how the police and prosecutors had mishandled the case and had unfairly subjected them to criticism that they had hampered the investigation.\nAt one point, Mr. Maddox's voice quavered and his eyes began tearing as he said he was hurt and insulted by Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward's suggestion on Tuesday that the lawyer was involved in the case for the money he could make from any civil suit growing out of the incident.\n''How could Ward be used by that man that way,'' Mr. Maddox said, referring to Mayor Koch. ''I have not received a dime from the Griffith family or any soul breathing air on this earth. I have not been promised a dime from the Griffith family or from any soul breathing air on this earth. I have no expectations of receiving a dime from the Griffith family or any soul breathing air on this earth.'' 'An Even Greater Degree'\nAt a news conference after the hour-and-a-half meeting in City Hall, the Mayor said that he had asked for and heard the participants' recommendations for eliminating racial discrimination in the city. The Mayor conceded that it may be more difficult to eliminate the racism ''in the hearts of people.'' But he vowed that his administration would work to see that the law was vigorously applied in cases of racial bias and racial violence.\n''Those who violate the law should be brought to justice very quickly and, when tried and convicted, be sentenced to an even greater degree than they would if the case did not include that bias aspect.''\nThe Mayor's comments came in the wake of a meeting that at first appeared to what some of the black leaders had thought to be an attempt to reinforce his call Tuesday to the lawyers for one of the victims, Cedric Sandiford, to end their refusal to allow their client to be interviewed by the prosecutors.\nAlthough spokesmen for the Mayor insisted that was not its purpose, the suggestion was much on the minds of those who attended. Comment From Rangel\nRepresentative Charles B. Rangel, a Harlem Democrat, said that he was pleased that the Mayor had not tried to convince those in attendance that they should, as a group,''second-guess the judge, prosecutor witness or attorneys'' in the case.\nThe Rev. Floyd H. Flake, who will soon take his seat as the new Congressman from the Queens district in which the Dec. 20 attack took place, added: ''It is appropriate that the Mayor has not tried to beat us in line on this issue, or to tell us what he wants us to do or say to the people. But to ask our concerns about what we do to eliminate racism.''\nWhen asked whether the Mayor's concern was uncharacteristic, Mr. Rangel, in the past a frequent critic of the Mayor on a host of issues, including what he has termed Mr. Koch's lack of sensitivity to black concerns, was conciliatory and praised the leadership that the Mayor had shown so far in condemning the Howard Beach attack. But he added:\n''When one responds in a manner that you would want them to, it serves no purpose to attribute any ill motivation to it. There is absolutely no question in my mind that the Mayor has been an outspoken critic of those who take the law in their own hands.''\nBefore and after the session, others reacted to the criticism of the session. Harriet Michel, the president of the New York Urban League, when asked about the criticism, said she was ''absolutely not'' attending the meeting to join in criticism of Mr. Sandiford and his lawyer, Mr. Maddox. 'Made Sure It Was Not'\nRoscoe Brown Jr., the president of Bronx Community College, said that the idea of joining the criticism of the victims' lawyers was never raised and ''we made sure it was not.''\nArthur Barnes, the president of the New York Urban Coalition, said that ''there was no lynch-mob atmosphere, but a positive and exemplary one.''\nPrior to the meeting, Mr. Flake had said that all of those scheduled to attend had ''reputations and constituencies'' and could not afford to simply join the Mayor in criticizing the attorneys.\n''I'm not part of a lynch mob or a coon show,'' said Councilwoman Priscilla Wooten of Brooklyn. ''I would not try to pressure the lawyers. When the Mayor says he wants to discuss black issues, I have to go.'' 'Great Deal of Respect'\nAlthough most of the participants said that the issue of joining the call for Mr. Maddox and his client to cooperate with the Queens District Attorney never arose, the Rev. Leo Hamilton of the Bethany Baptist Church in Jamaica, Queens, said that some did suggest to the Mayor that his evaluation of the case had caused problems.\n''I have a great deal of respect for the Mayor, but he established a basis for evaluating this situation which almost seemed to throw the onus back on to blacks,'' he said of the Mayor's criticism of Mr. Maddox. ''We told him that we thought that should not have been the impression he left.''\nAnother participant in the meeting, who did not want to be identified, said that some had also criticized Police Commissioner Ward's suggestion at a news conference Tuesday with the Mayor that Mr. Maddox was motivated by the money that might result in a successful civil suit in connection with the racial attack. He said the comment was ''uncalled for.''\nAmong the things that the participants talked about, the Mayor said, was the need to do more in the city's education system and the enforcement of antidiscrimination laws in housing, employment and other areas to ''improve the racial climate'' in the city. Housing Problems\nThe Manhattan Borough President, David N. Dinkins, said that many of the issues had come up in the past in other sessions in which blacks have criticized some city policies.\n''These things tend to foster a climate that permits a Howard Beach to happen,'' said Mr. Dinkins, referring to problems of poor housing, poverty and the problems that he said plagued blacks in the city more than others.\nThe Mayor termed the group an ad hoc one that was just the first of a number of such groups he would be meeting with to devise ways of easing racial tensions in the city and improving its racial climate.\nPerhaps the only specific initiatives he presented to the group were some details in a briefing by Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones and the Board of Education president, Robert F. Wagner Jr., of a new curriculum on race relations and tolerance that is to be instituted within a few weeks in city schools. 'More Positive'\nMr. Rangel said after the meeting that he personally saw a contrast in the way the Mayor had responded to the Howard Beach incident and his response to other issues in the past that bared racial tensions in the city.\n''It is more positive,'' Mr. Rangel said, adding that he hoped that response indicated ''some continuity by the Mayor in creating an atmosphere to avoid these incidents in the future.''\nThe Mayor said that his feelings and attitudes toward prejudice remained the same, but allowed that he had expressed them differently and more intensely this time after the Howard Beach incident. He attributed that to his own experiences as a lawyer aiding civil-rights workers in the South during the 1960's, in which he himself was followed and chased by a group of whites opposed to the rights demonstrations. A 'Wrenching Experience'\nHe said that the accounts of the fate of the person killed in the Howard Beach incident recalled for him his own feelings of terror then.\n''This case caused me an enormous wrenching experience and I could feel the terror,'' the Mayor said. ''It was palpable and that's what caused me to single this out.''\nNone of the participants in the meeting responded to the use of the term ''coon'' by Mr. Sharpton. Mayor Koch noted, however, that Mr. Sharpton had sought an invitation to the session and had been refused. It was only after he had asked the Rev. Jesse Jackson to intercede for him with the Mayor that he was invited.\n''Then he did what he did,'' the Mayor said, referring to Mr. Sharpton's failure to show up.\nThese were the participants at the meeting with Mayor Koch: Betty Adams.

201	COURT THROWS OUT CONTEMPT RULING AGAINST PAPER	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB1E3FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit today threw out contempt convictions against the Providence Journal Company and its executive editor, Charles McC. Hauser, for printing an article two years ago about the late Raymond L. S. Patriarca, a reputed major organized crime figure.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit today threw out contempt convictions against the Providence Journal Company and its executive editor, Charles McC. Hauser, for printing an article two years ago about the late Raymond L. S. Patriarca, a reputed major organized crime figure.\nThe article was based on tapes of conversations involving Mr. Patriarca.\nThe action overturned a verdict by Federal District Judge Francis J. Boyle, who sentenced Mr. Hauser to an 18-month suspended jail term and fined the newspaper $100,000 on conviction for criminal contempt.\nJudge Boyle's ruling stemmed from an article published Nov. 14, 1985 by The Journal about Mr. Patriarca that included information from Federal Bureau of Investigation logs and memoranda obtained by The Journal and others under the Freedom of Information Act. The court had banned publication of any article. Ruling 'Transparently Invalid'\n''We conclude that the district court's order of Nov. 13, 1985, was transparently invalid,'' wrote Judge John Minor Wisdom, a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judge who was specially assigned to the case.\n''The order constituted a presumptively unconstitutional prior restraint on pure speech by the press. The burden to sustain such an order is tremendously heavy, and was not met in this case.\n''The only potential danger posed by the restrained speech was to an individual's privacy right. That right can be adequately protected by a subsequent damages action.''\nThe move to prevent publication was filed by attorneys for Mr. Patriarca's son, Raymond J. Patriarca. No Comment on Decision\nA lawyer for Mr. Patriarca, William A. Curran, said, ''I haven't seen the decision, so I don't have anything to say about it.'' Mr. Partriarca could not be reached for comment.\nMr. Hauser is vice president of the company, which publishes The Journal, a morning and Sunday newspaper; The Bulletin, an afternoon paper, and The Journal-Bulletin, a Saturday paper.\nHe issued a statement saying in part, ''We believed from the beginning that our publication of material from the so-called Patriarca tapes was protected under the First Amendment.\n''The circuit court ruling sends a clear massage to lower courts that prior restraints on publication will not be tolerated.'' Statement by Publisher\n''We're pleased that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has upheld us,'' said Michael P. Metcalf, chairman and chief executive officer of The Providence Journal Company and publisher of The Providence Journal-Bulletin.\n''The Circuit Court ruling strongly reaffirms similar findings on prior restraint issues. While The Journal-Bulletin felt it had no alternative but to publish in violation of the court's prohibition, our decision to do so was a most wrenching one. And while our action was drastic, it was taken with nothing but the highest respect for the court.''\nJudge Wisdom heard the case with Levin Campbell, chief judge of the 1st Circuit, and Frank Coffin, a circuit judge.\nIn his opinion, Judge Wisdom said the case involved a conflict between the First Amendment principle against prior restraint on freedom of the press and the need for orderly government and obedience to court orders.

Byrne in the 1983 election in which she was defeated by Harold Washington.\nIn early September a jury awarded each of the officers $55,000 in compensatory damages and $275,000 in punitive damages, more than the $250,000 sought in the lawsuit.\nIn his ruling Tuesday, Judge Milton I. Shadur said the trial had produced no evidence of political discrimination, although he noted that a reasonable juror might have concluded there was some evidence of racial discrimination.\nJudge Shadur reversed a jury's finding that the 13 were entitled to punitive damages. He also said three of the plaintiffs were not entitled to compensatory damages.\nThe judge also ruled that Raleigh Mathis, former executive director of the Office of Municipal Investigations, who along with the city was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, was not personally liable for any damages.\nJudge Shadur reversed the jury's finding of racial discrimination against three of the officers and requested additional information from eight plaintiffs. He gave two officers the option of accepting $15,000 each in compensatory damages or requesting a new trial to determine damages.

She received 277 votes Tuesday while the other candidates, Juan B. Abeita and Alvino Lucero, who had been governor, got 208 and 109 votes.\nUnder the pueblo's constitution, Mr. Abeita now becomes president of the tribal council and Mr. Lucero will be the council's vice president.\nMs. Williamson said her first official act would be to name four council members, at least one of whom will be a woman. Most Vocal Opponent\nThe former council president, Ernest Jaramillo, was the most vocal opponent to Ms. Williamson's candidacy. He said he and others would meet with lawyers to determine if the election was legal.\nMr. Jaramillo said the election began when three candidates forced their way into the election room, opened the ballot box and forced the tribal secretary to begin accepting ballots.\n''It's like a mob mob rule with the law on their side,'' Mr. Jaramillo said. ''They used the police officer to manhandle my councilmen.''\nMs. Williamson, 36 years old, who runs a counseling program on substance abuse, received enough votes in the tribal primary election Dec. 6 and 7 to become one of three finalists for office.\nBut the council voted Dec. 16 to void the primary.\nLorenzo R. Jojola, a judge of the tribal court, then ruled that the election should proceed. Mr. Jaramillo said the council, acting in its role as an appellate court, voted to stay the judge's order.\nMs. Williamson called the election ''a truly great victory,'' adding, ''They have spoken loud and clear that they want a more open and representative government. We intend to give them that.''\n''Now's the time for all our people to come together,'' she continued.

204	SANDSTROM'S 3 STOP ISLANDERS	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDB1E3FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: One team emerged energized, the other demoralized, and both spoke of the need to construct some winning streaks.\nOne team emerged energized, the other demoralized, and both spoke of the need to construct some winning streaks.\n''No matter how you slice it, to win on successive nights and in successive games is what it takes to build a consistent team,'' said John Vanbiesbrouck, the Ranger goalie, who last night credited his teammates with taking ''the big shots.''\nThe Rangers charged into the overtime session at Madison Square Garden, hitting posts and sending the Islander squad into a frenzy of disarray, but somehow the Islanders fended them off. Then, with 53 seconds left, Bryan Trottier received a slashing penalty and Tomas Sandstrom completed his hat trick for a 4-3 victory with 23 seconds remaining.\nIt was the first hat trick as a Ranger for Sandstrom, whose ferocity at close quarters in front of the Islander net twice earned him game-tying goals and finally brought about the game-winner.\n''It surprised me when they called the penalty at that time,'' he said, ''because they hadn't called much all night long. But I felt like every guy on our team was going for the win when we went out in overtime. If we didn't win this, they'd be ahead by 9 points, maybe too far to catch.''\nIn the overtime, the Rangers overwhelmed Kelly Hrudey, the Islander goalie, by taking six shots to none for his team. Wave After Wave\n''What I saw was wave after wave,'' said Hrudey, who underwent similar straits to salvage a 3-3 tie at Pittsburgh on Saturday. ''Besides starting a new year, we really need to string some wins together.''\nLately, the Rangers, who beat the Penguins Tuesday night, been dominant in their division while the Islanders, now without a victory in their last four outings, had been unconvincing against all comers. Historically speaking, the Islanders have been notably unconvincing at the Garden, where their record, after last night, was 2-9-2 in their last 13 visits.\n''The call against me was too obvious for me to even comment on,'' said Trottier, who did not appear to touch Tony McKegney with his stick. ''But we have to give them the edge in overtime. They created some good chances while we had none.''\nLast night, as appears to be their wont in a series knotted 1-1-1 after three previous meetings, the two clubs jostled their way to a 3-3 tie in regulation time amidst more than the normal amount of hilarity, vulgarity and noisemaking.\nSandstom scored his second goal of the evening and gained the tie at 5:32 of the final period when he arrived alone at the left post, collected a pass from Jan Erixon and made his move on Hrudey, who watched the puck whisk between his legs the moment he raised his stick to try and poke it away from Sandstrom.\nThe Rangers, persistantly but often inartiscally on the attack, outshot their guests, 31-21, after three periods. Esposito Fills In Again\nThe Rangers skated strongly, again under the vivid direction of General Manager Phil Esposito. Esposito will remain coach until Tom Webster, who is still recovering from ear surgery, returns on Monday.\nEsposito had to be pleased with the pace his players performed at, but their markmanship, especially on the power play, was less than forbidding in the first and second periods.\nBut so, for that matter, was the offensive posturing of the Islanders, at least until a power-play opportunity came their way at the close of the first period.\nThe Rangers went ahead, 1-0, at 12:50 when a defenseman, Curt Giles, sent a slap shot from the point bouncing past Hrudey, the Islanders' goaltender of choice in divisional matches (9-2-1 going into this game). Hrudey was partially screened by Tomas Jonsson as he moved Mike Ridley out of the crease area. Islanders Lethargic\nOnce they had their goal, the Rangers concentrated on slowing down the Islander attackers, not such a monumental task, considering the lethargy of the attack in the early going. There was a preponderance of mild-mannered tugging and groping, and until Mike Ridley was caught on a high-sticking minor at 17:45, it seemed to work.\nBut with four seconds remaining in the penalty, Patrick Flatley took Mike Bossy's pass and chipped a wrist shot by Vanbiesbrouck, who was returning to the nets after a two-game layoff that featured Bob Froese, and the game was tied 1-1 at 19:42.\nAlan Kerr got his second goal of the season for the Islanders at 10:58 of the second period when he blasted a low shot from the right circle past Vanbiesbrouck, providing the Islanders with a brief edge.\nBut Sandstrom, who corraled Don Maloney's pass at the inside edge of the right circle and lauched it midair, gained a 2-2 tie at 14:30.\nThe Islanders damaged the Rangers late in the period again, and took a 3-2 advantage when Rich Kromm snapped a high shot over Vanbiesbrouck's glove at 19:22.
205	EX-DEFENDANTS IN CHILD ABUSE CASE TO APPEAL RULING ON SUIT	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA1E3FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Lawyers for three former preschool teachers said today that they would appeal a judge's ruling that tossed out part of a large civil suit alleging false arrest on charges of child abuse. He said the women had filed their suit too late.\nLawyers for three former preschool teachers said today that they would appeal a judge's ruling that tossed out part of a large civil suit alleging false arrest on charges of child abuse. He said the women had filed their suit too late.\nThe three former teachers, Virginia McMartin, the 79-year-old founder of the McMartin Preschool institution in nearby Manhattan Beach; her granddaughter, Peggy Ann Buckey, 30, and Babette Spitler, 38, filed civil suits this year, each seeking $10 million in compensatory damages and an unspecified amount in punitive damages stemming from their arrest, imprisonment and a long preliminary hearing.\nThe three women filed their claims in Los Angeles Superior Court after all criminal charges against them and two other McMartin teachers were dropped last January. At the time, Ira Reiner, the Los Angeles County District Attorney, said the evidence against the five was ''incredibly weak.''\nIn all, seven McMartin teachers and administrators were arrested when the case began in 1984. There are now two remaining defendants, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 60, and her son Raymond, 28, who are awaiting trial. A hearing to determine if Mr. Reiner's office engaged in discriminatory prosecution in failing to dismiss the charges against Peggy McMartin Buckey and Raymond Buckey will resume Monday. Ruling on Deadline\nIn dismissing the part of the civil suit that deals with false arrest, invasion of privacy and slander, Judge Warren Deering of Superior Court said the women should have filed their claims within 100 days of their arrest in March, 1984.\nHe said that if the plaintiffs' assertions were that they were innocent at the time of the arrest, then they ''should have filed their claims within 100 days of that.''\nJames Davis, who represents Virginia McMartin and Peggy Ann Buckey, said today that to his knowledge the 100-day deadline ''had never been applied this way before.''\nIn an interview, Mr. Davis said it would have been a ''totally useless act'' to file within 100 days of their arrest in March, 1984, in part because criminal charges always take precedence over civil actions, which normally begin after criminal cases are over. 'A Bizarre Result'\nMr. Davis argued that the 100-day deadline should run not from the time of arrest but from the date when Mr. Reiner dropped charges against the plaintiffs in January. He said the judge ''should have interpreted the statute as originally written,'' adding that he would ask Judge Deering to reconsider his ruling. ''It is a bizarre result,'' he added. Mr. Davis and Eliseo D. W. Gauna, who represents Mrs. Spitler, said that the heart of their suit, that state officials, specifically the District Attorney's office, engaged in civil rights violations, was still intact.\nThe civil rights section of the law does not have a 100-day time requirement, Mr. Davis said. The women say their prosecution and their long preliminary hearing were based on unreliable testimony of preschool children interviewed by therapists unschooled in criminal investigation.\nUnder state law, district attorneys and their assistants generally have broad powers of immunity against civil suits and damages arising from their actions. County attorneys, representing the District Attorney's office, have raised the immunity argument in seeking to dismiss the action. But Mr. Davis argues that prosecutors do not have immunity for improper investigation. Officials Dispute Charges\nCounty attorneys representing the District Attorney's office also say that there was nothing improper in the nature of the McMartin investigation. Mr. Davis says the initial inquiry, which came amid a heated election campaign between Mr. Reiner and Robert Philobosian, the then District Attorney, led Mr. Philobosian to use the McMartin case to gain publicity. Mr. Philobosian lost the race.\nMr. Philobosian, who was named as a defendant in the civil suit, has denied the charges.

207	AS LAVA FLOWS IN HAWAII, EXPLANATIONS ABOUND	1987-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DA1E3FF932A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: David Lanakila figures the problem of the flowing lava was created by the Hawaiian fire goddess Pele because she objects to plans to drill into Kilauea's flanks to get steam to generate electricity.\nDavid Lanakila figures the problem of the flowing lava was created by the Hawaiian fire goddess Pele because she objects to plans to drill into Kilauea's flanks to get steam to generate electricity.\nAlso, said this Hawaiian, who is called ''Uncle'' by those partying in the shade alongside the old house where he has lived 30 years, the fire goddess is in bad temper because Hawaiians, her people, long ago lost ownership of their land to whites.\nIn the old Hawaiian religion, Pele controlled the volcanoes Mauna Loa and Kilauea and the paths taken by their lava flows were signs of her displeasure. Mr. Lanakila, pointing to the hill beneath the erupting 4,000-foot Kilauea, said: ''White people own it. It's a warning. She wiped out all those homes.''\nHe turned and peered through the palms to the sea 150 feet away. ''I always say leave it to Grandma; she knows what to do,'' he said, referring to Pele.\nThe electric generating project in question has been built over five years with joint state and Federal financing. The geothermal electric plant has been installed and is operated by the Hawaii Electric Light Company, the electric utility for the island of Hawaii. The installation, which will be expanded to a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts by 1993, has not been threatened by the eruption because it is at a higher elevation.\nScientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory have a different explanation for the lava flows in November and December that have destroyed 28 homes, cut a major highway, knocked out telephone and power lines and carried molten lava to the sea for the first time since 1974.\nThe scientists' theory is that the Hawaiian islands were each built up over millions of years by flows of melted rock that rose from a ''hot spot'' in the sea floor in the Pacific. #3 Million Years in Building The Pacific floor is 18,000 feet below the sea surface here, and Mauna Loa, rising 13,667 feet above the sea, is a single volcanic mass almost 32,000 feet tall. It is Earth's largest such volcanic mountain, three million years in building. In the two centuries over which records have been kept, Mauna Loa has put new lava over only 160,000 acres, and Kilauea over 38,000 acres.\nThey are the only active Hawaiian volcanoes now. Both go into long periods of inactivity. But they erupted simultaneously March 30, 1984, for the first time since 1868. In that series of eruptions, which began at Kilauea in January 1984, Mauna Loa, after nine quiet years, sent a finger of lava to within seven miles of Hilo, this island's largest city.\nMeantime, Kilauea squirted spectacular fountains of molten rock hundreds of feet into the air and sent lava flows downhill in 1983 that destroyed 18 homes on the upper slopes well away from where recent damage occurred.\nThen, on July 20, lava began to flow from new place in the East Rift Zone, a crater-lined crack along Kilauea's flank 2,000 feet above here, seven miles uphill. It was ''pahoehoe'' lava, with temperatures over 2,200 degrees. The Hawaiian word, pronounced pah-hoy-hoy, describes a lava that flows like heavy pudding. Another Hawaiian word, ''aa,'' pronounced ah-ah, describes the chunky lava that looks like coal fire cinders.\nNothing seems to stop the lava. Firefighters in November sprayed water on the advancing toe of a flow moving at about 100 feet an hour. Water hardened the toe and diverted it from the Louis Pau home near here. But a week later a new flow destroyed the house.\n''You can't stop it or hate it,'' said Mr. Pau, a retired ranger in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.\nOver 100 families were evacuated from threatened areas but they have moved back since the flow stopped coming down the hill on Dec. 19.\nThe new vent continues to exude about 650,000 cubic yards of lava a day, according to scientists. But now the material stays on the hill to build the growing dome over the vent.\nThe lava that devastated the settlements down the hill traveled through tubes beneath the dome that are created as lava on the flow surface cools and hotter lava beneath flows faster.\nChuck Humphrey, a freelance photographer who moved here eight years ago, discussed some of the economic aspects of the four-year eruption. ''I couldn't afford to live here if it weren't for the lava,'' he said. ''Lots in my subdivision sold for $13,000 and now they go at $4,000.''\nHe looked around at the store, church, and houses that make up this small settlement. He came here to pick up his mail from one of a few dozen lock boxes in an open-sided shed that offers shelter from the rain.\n''I'd guess about 90 houses were built around here in eight years,'' he said. ''This may slow things.'' The lava flow has cut him off from his mailbox. His home is just three miles from here, but with the road blocked by five-foot thick lava, and he must now walk or drive 60 miles until the highway reopens.\nWhere homes were overrun, all that remains are corrugated sheets that were roofs, metal furnishings not rescued in time, and upper portions of coconut palms and mango trees that still smoulder where they were burned away from their roots by the advancing lava.\nSome homes had old cars in the yards, and decorative fences of piled rock. These have been partly buried in lava. One had an oramental iron gate, now drooping and misshapen, its supporting posts distorted by the heat and shoved askew by the lava's weight. Of the walls and floors, nothing remains.

Smoke continued to billow from the structure as the Puerto Rican authorities attempted to determine the number of casualties.\n''We have so far about 40 dead people,'' said Daniel Velez, press secretary to Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, and other officials and witnesses said the death toll could easily be higher. Explosions Reported\n''There are many areas we have not been able to get into and don't know what we will find there,'' said Police Superintendent Jose Lopez Feliciano.\nMost of the bodies recovered after the fire were found in the lobby and casino, on the mezzanine level, and a restaurant on a lower level that serves a pool and the beach area. None of the victims were immediately identified.\nWithout a full inspection of the interior, officials were not speculating on the cause of the fire, but a number of witnesses said they heard explosions at the time it broke out. The 450-room hotel, one of the largest tourist hotels in Puerto Rico, has a sprinkler system, but it was not immediately clear whether it had been working.\nMr. Lopez Feliciano said the arson squad was investigating the fire and the reports of explosions. An agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also talking to hotel personnel. 'Big Burst of Smoke'\nA witness, Kevin W. Condon, of Ansonia, Conn., said there were at least 70 people in the casino when he was playing blackjack and somebody said there was smoke. ''But nobody paid any attention, and we continued playing,'' he said. ''Then there was a big burst of smoke and we went running toward one of the exits. When someone opened the door, we saw that the whole hallway was covered with black smoke. We slammed the door, went running toward the other exit and that was filled with black smoke. Then the panic began.''\nHe said he broke a window with a chair and jumped from the mezzanine level to the ground, breaking his left leg. He said later at Pavia Hospital that he had seen two other people escape out the window, ''but I don't think anybody else got out of there.''\nFire Chief Francisco Ortiz Soto said that at least 50 were believed killed on the casino level.\nJohn Lolli, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., who was in the casino when the fire began, said, ''The heat was so intense that people had to crawl out on their hands and knees.''\nThe injured were taken to a number of different hospitals and it was impossible to get an accurate idea of how many people were hurt in the fire. The Rio Pedras Medical Center, was treating 23 to 25 victims, most suffering from smoke inhalation, said Dr. Juan Nazario. Six or seven were in critical condition and the others were in stable condition, he said.\nAn estimated 125 people were evacuated from the hotel by 7 P.M., the Coast Guard said. By 11:30 P.M. the fire and smoke had stopped and the authorities had shut down their rescue operation for the night, without a clear notion of the number of casualties or the cause of the inferno. Union Meeting in Ballroom\nThe blaze apparently started at 3:30 P.M. in a ground-floor ballroom, minutes after the room had been used by hotel employees affiliated with the teamsters' union, which was bargaining a new contract. No officials suggested any link between the fire and the union Jose Cadiz, a teamster official, said the union had nothing to do with the fire. ''I know a lot of people are going to accuse the teamsters,'' he said. ''It's natural that if there was an impasse, people would think the union would do anything, but the union is not crazy.''\nA hotel spokesman, who asked not be identified, said that almost immediately after the fire broke out an explosion was heard in the casino on the mezzanine floor. Flames quickly gutted the lower floors, where most of the deaths were reported.\nThe hotel spokesman said he had been told there were several other explosions, including one in the kitchen.\nThe worst of the fire was confined to the lobby, the poolside restaurant, kitchen, casino and gift shops on the two lower floors. Some of the guests who made it out of the building moved around looking for their loved ones. New Yorkers Among the Rescued\nAlicia Knupfer of Flushing, N.Y., said she was in an 11th-floor room when she saw smoke outside the window and found the hallway filled with smoke. ''The elevators weren't working and I went into the stairway in which people were climbing up on the roof,'' she said at the Pavia Hospital tonight. ''We started climbing up and when we got to the roof a Puerto Rico International helicopter picked us up with a large basket.''\nThe smoke-filled stairways left frightened guests uncertain whether they would escape. ''We heard a voice above us yelling, 'Keep coming, keep coming, you're almost there,' said Natalie David, 43 years old, of Manhattan. ''Until then we thought we would never make it. It was so black with smoke we couldn't see anything.'' #4 Jersey Teen-Agers Unhurt The Associated Press interviewed several hotel guests from the New York area who escaped injury. Among them were four 17-year-olds from North Jersey, Anthony Cannon, Timothy Conway, Alberto Mascaro and Kevin Twomey, all high school students from Bergen who said they were in Puerto Rico to watch their basketball team compete.\nThey said they were by the pool when they heard two loud noises and the shattering of glass. ''It took us a long time to realize what was happening,'' Timothy was quoted as saying.\nOthers who told the A.P. that they had heard explosions were Murray Bates, a jewelry manufacturer from North Woodmere, L.I., and Dr. Hiram Morganstein, an optometrist from Englewood Cliffs, N.J..\n''All of a sudden I see smoke coming from the kitchen - we heard that bomb go off and an explosion,'' said Dr. Morganstein, who was in a cafeteria with his wife, Pearl, and 22-year-old daughter, Audrey. ''It sounded like a hand grenade going off.'' Shower of Broken Glass\nAlexander Leighton, the owner of the Casablanca guest house across the street from the hotel, said he was walking his dog on the beach when he saw smoke coming from the lower floors of the building at 3:26 P.M. Then he saw flames on the ground floors, he said.\n''People were running out of the pool area bleeding from cuts from glass that showered the area,'' he said. ''Two croupiers came running across the pool area and jumped into the pool with their clothing smoldering.''\nThe hotel spokesman said the management of the hotel, which is owned by Hotel Systems International of Anaheim, Calif., met with the teamsters' union Tuesday night at the Department of Labor, where the hotel gave the union what it said would be its final offer. ''The union said they would not accept it but they came to us this morning and asked for the use of a ballroom so they could take the offer to the union membership,'' he said.\n''We gave them use of the ballroom,'' he said. ''After the meeting broke up, the doors were locked and then someone yelled fire. Moments after that there was an explosion in the casino.''

Warning Is Issued\nA city official warned that anyone ''who dares make trouble in the capital of our great socialist motherland and on sacred Tiananmen Square will be severely punished.''\nHis comments, carried in the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily, also accused the anti-Communist leadership of Taiwan of mobilizing ''secret agents'' to incite student demonstrators, the first time that charge has been made.\nThe newly pasted-up wall posters at Beijing University accused the Government of failing to live up to its promises of democratic reform and urged students to take the lead in bringing freedom and democracy to China.\nA demonstration on Tiananmen Square would be the first Beijing rally by the students outside their isolated academic area in the northwest part of the capital. 'Attempt to Create Chaos'\nThe municipal official, whose name was not used in the editorial statement, said ''a handful of elements hostile to the socialist system are planning to create disturbances on Tiananmen Square soon in an attempt to create chaos in Beijing, thus leading to nationwide chaos.''\nAuthorities say no arrests of students have been made so far in pro-democracy protests reported this month in at least 10 Chinese cities.\nLast Friday, following huge street marches in Shanghai and smaller ones in Beijing and elsewhere, Beijing authorities announced that those wanting to demonstrate must apply to police five days beforehand. The police said Wednesday that they received no requests for a demonstration at Tiananmen.\nThe city also banned outright demonstrations at major sites such as the Great Hall of the People, right next to Tiananmen.\nOne poster at Beijing University was signed in blood and called the present student movement ''epoch-making'' in significance. It said the Communist Party is fundamentally good but changes must be made in a nation where privilege still rules and peasants are regarded as subhuman.\nStudents read the posters, which are banned, using flashlights and candles. Some recited the words into tape recorders, to be transcribed and passed on to other universities.\nFour or five large groups of students formed around individuals who were delivering speeches or debating various aspects of the democratic movement or the means students should take to support it.\nOne student said students were under strong pressure from professors to stay away from the marches. Campaign Against Students\nStudents have also been subject this past week to an increasingly vitriolic press campaign against their movement.\nThe city official quoted on the front page of People's Daily on Wednesday said Taiwan's Voice of Free China radio on Dec. 17 instructed its special agents on the mainland to take ''unanimous actions at the appropriate time'' to abet the student protests.\nHe said Taiwan has also told its agents ''to use various means to encourage and aid young students to bravely participate in the demonstrations.''\nWednesday's statement also attacked ''a certain foreign radio station'' for emphasizing the student demonstrations in ''inflammatory'' Chinese-language broadcasts. It apparently referred to Voice of America, which has a wide audience in China and for many students is a main source of news about other parts of the country.\nThe same report said student unrest was being manipulated by ''a handful of elements hostile to socialism.''

He says quite often that he likes the Cardinal.\nCardinal O'Connor's decision to revise his schedule in Israel generated protests from Israeli and American Jewish officials. But Mr. Koch called criticism of the Cardinal ''a great error.''\n''We, as Jews now, have no greater friend than the Cardinal,'' he said on Sunday, the day the Cardinal left. ''I admire him. I respect him. I have great affection for him. I believe no matter what the restraints, constraints are on this particular visit, good will come of it.''\nMr. Koch also said the Cardinal expressed ''the pain he personally felt in having to change his itinerary'' in a conversation they had on Saturday.\nHe thinks the Vatican should recognize Israel, and should do so now, the Mayor added.

Dove, is something of a fixture in the Senate after 20 years' service, first as an assistant and then as chief parliamentarian since 1981. But he was drawn into a contretemps with the Democratic leader Robert C. Byrd, then in the minority, a few months ago on a complex procedural question after a cloture vote. The matter took a day and a half to resolve; by the time it was over, a ruling based on Mr. Dove's interpretation of procedure was overturned by an overwhelming 92-to-5 vote on the floor. Mr. Byrd, himself a master parliamentarian, is now the majority leader, and Mr. Dove is out of a job.\nMr. Dove will be succeeded by Alan S. Frumin, now an assistant parliamentarian, who will officially assume his new duties Tuesday.\nSenator Byrd himself declined to discuss the reasons behind the change, but did take time in a telephone interview to bat down a rumor he was also planning to replace the Senate chaplain, Richard Halverson.\n''I've never thought of firing the chaplain,'' the Senator said.

Pote, 45, will continue as chief financial officer.\n''I don't think we'll have a chairman's title,'' Mr. Pote said. ''Titles are not that important to Tony anyway.''\nMr. Moulton agreed. ''We work together so well as a team that we never had made a big deal about titles,'' he said. Mr. Moulton was speaking from Mr. Green's vacation home in the Adirondacks, where he was relaxing after the successful tender offer. The Charles P.

''After building up this company for 20 years, he said, 'I've had it,' and I said to him, 'I can't blame you.' ''\nThe financial printing business is changing technologically and Pandick had taken diversification steps to get into new technology. But it has taken time for the strategy to pay off, Mr. Moulton said, and Wall Street's insistence on quarter-to-quarter performance made it difficult to remain a public company. ''The public stockholder pays a price for that,'' Mr. Pote said. ''It's not fair to the stockholder or management.''\nTheir plans were upset for a time by the rival offer to the buyout plan.

Given its tremendous power, China's one-party state could have easily nipped these demonstrations at the very beginning.\nIn virtually all the reports about the recent student demonstrations in China, little has been said of the restraint shown by the Chinese Communist Party. Given its tremendous power, China's one-party state could have easily nipped these demonstrations at the very beginning.\nYet, even as party leaders harshly denounced the demonstrators, they allowed a protest for a more open nominating process to peoples' congresses to expand into a more general demand for competitive elections and freedom of speech. The demonstrations spread for at least four weeks to China's major cities, including the capital.\nThere are several reasons for the party's relative tolerance, including its desire to project a moderate image abroad; memories of the Cultural Revolution and a desire not to provoke another reign of terror by cracking down too harshly; and, most important, the fact that the demonstrations serve the interests of certain factions at the top levels of political leadership in ongoing debates over reform.\nSince the spring of 1986, the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, and his reform faction have called for political reforms to accompany economic changes. They argue that China's openness and economic development cannot be sustained unless the party decentralizes its power and reduces its role in economic management. Their attempt to gain acceptance of such a proposal at a Central Committee meeting last September was blocked by conservative leaders, led by the Politburo member and economic planner Chen Yun. The final resolution talked about building socialist spiritual civilization rather than reforming the political system.\nNevertheless, the debate on politi cal reform continues and encompasses more radical suggestions. Some intellectuals insist political reform should not be merely a tool of economic reform. Others urge the party to lessen its role not only in the economy but also in the judiciary, the Government and everyday life.\nAlthough these recommendations and the student protests call for more far-reaching reforms than the Deng leadership seeks, Mr. Deng and his reform group use these protests to exert pressure on top leaders for their more limited reforms. This is not the first time they have done this. In the late 1970's, they allowed the so-called Democratic Movement to use wall posters, pamphlets and demonstrations to force out the remaining Maoists in the central leadership and to launch their own economic program. With Mr. Deng's goals achieved, he cracked down on democratic activists.\nA similar scenario may be unfolding today. In order to bring about limited political reform, the Deng leadership may have allowed student demonstrations to spread and capture the nation's attention. Yet after four weeks, he as well as the conservative leaders have gradually suppressed the protestors. If the demonstrations become too disruptive, the conservatives may use them as an excuse to call for an end or evena reversal of previous reforms, as they attempted to do in the ''spiritual pollution'' campaign in the fall of 1983.\nWhile the top leaders may be able to manipulate demonstrations for their own purposes, almost invariably the protests set in motion ideas and actions they cannot wholly control. In a similar fashion, Mao Zedong used the Red Guard demonstrations during the Cultural Revolution to purge the opposing political faction. His call ''to rebel against authority'' led to anarchy, which he finally suppressed with violence. But it also ultimately led to the Democratic Movement of the late 1970's.\nAlthough Mr. Deng initially used the Democratic Momement for his own purposes in the late 1970's, he too reined in the activists when they demanded more democratic rights than he was willing to allow. Yet their demands have stimulated the current debate on political reform.\nEven though the student demonstrations are now waning, China's recent history suggests that demonstrations, manipulated to exert pressure on the leaders at the top, ofter spark ideas and practices that the manipu-lators cannot fully extinguish.

If negotiations are successful, there will be a four-week hiatus when the current stars leave after the final performance in Palm Beach on Jan. 18. The new duo would begin rehearsals in mid-February for an opening ''somewhere'' the following month. The eight-week interim would also allow further work on James Kirkwood's comedyabout two aging and battling film stars.\nBroadway? ''Absolutely, if the stars and the play work,'' said Edwin Gifford, the production's public-relations representative.\nThere's something to be said for beginning the year with some humor. As a matter of fact, there's a lot to be said for it, because humor has it all over vitamins and egg creams when it comes to fortifying the spirit.\nA mom and pop who are drifting apart and a son who plays with dolls don't sound terribly amusing, but then we're not humorists like Michael Golder. Mr. Golder has written ''The Square Root of Three,'' which is billed as a comedy. It has a grandmother who is busy falling in love, and it received several awards when it was presented at the O'Neill Theater Center. Brian Drillinger, Sylvia Kauders and Larry Block are in the cast, and starting next Saturday it will be at the Jewish Repertory Theater, 344 East 14th Street (505-2667).\nOn Wednesday, the Circle Repertory Company opens ''The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940,'' a comedy written and directed by a company member, John Bishop. This one has sliding panels, mistaken identities, a snowstorm, a stage-door slasher and maybe a Nazi spy, and they're all in preview at 99 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street (924-7100).\nThree divorced men and a California Casanova sound promising, especially when James van Maanen, the playwright, has put the foursome under one roof. Out of this has come ''Better Living,'' with the goings-on to involve Richard Bowme, Tom Gerard, Gordon MacDonald and Charles Major. The opening is scheduled for Jan. 16 at the Stage Arts Theater Company, 120 West 28th Street (645-4526 or 279-4200).\nNot for another six weeks - but ''Donkey's Years'' by Michael Frayn is crossing the Atlantic. A bit of froth about a reunion of upper-class British college classmates, the play was considered one of the best comedies in Britain a decade ago. We'll be able to see how it has held up, and if it survives the transplanting, on Feb. 19, when it's slated for a New York premiere at the New Theater of Brooklyn, 465 Dean Street, in Prospect Heights (718-230-3366).\nIf you think it's impossible to make something positive out of two single people alone in New York on a Saturday night, it doesn't much matter, because the plot takes second billing to the songs in ''Marry Me a Little.'' This musical pastiche of relatively unknown songs from Stephen Sondheim shows was originally presented Off Off Broadway in 1980, and will be at the York Theater Company as of Jan. 16. Some of the shows never saw the light of day; others that did - such as ''Follies,'' ''A Little Night Music'' and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' - lost a number of their songs before their Broadway openings.\nBack to the lonely people. They'll be played by Liz Callaway and John Jellison and directed by Stephen Lloyd Helper. Craig Lucas and Norman Rene conceived and developed the show, which will be performed at 2 East 90th Street (534-5366).\nTalking about ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' word is that Mickey Rooney will begin touring in it as of Feb. 27, starting in New Haven, continuing in such places as Boston and New Orleans and ending at the Westbury Music Fair on Long Island. Lee Guber, Shelly Gross and Bob Young are the people behind it, and you know the next line - ''if things go well, Broadway should follow.''\nHe comes from a district in England where the accents were once termed ''common'' (and for that matter, may still be), but meeting and listening to Roderick Cook, you'd never know it.\n''When I was a child, the thing to do was learn the King's English,'' he said. ''It was also called BBC English because that was the way the announcers used to talk.'' What it's called now doesn't matter, he said, because English children today pay it no mind and generally talk like ''Neanderthals.''\nMr. Cook, who devised, directed and is co-starring in a revival of ''Oh Coward!,'' which is to close tomorrow night, said he was afraid his continued identification with the show had led people to think of him exclusively as an upper-class Englishman.\n''I'm trapped in an image; it's a golden noose around my neck,'' he said. ''I sometimes feel like the Anthony Quinn of my set.''\nMr. Cook began acting and directing while a student at Cambridge, where he was, he said, ''part of the Cambridge set before it became the Cambridge set.'' Now, given his druthers, he'd like to give acting a pass and concentrate on writing and directing. At the moment, he's particularly interested in ''The Ninth Step,'' a ''five-character, one-set and four-handkerchief'' drama by Tom Ziegler, a new writer, and in ''Star Time,'' a musical he's written with William Roy.\nThe latter, he said, is an homage to 1940's movies.\n''It's as if we were given Betty Grable, Eve Arden, Phil Silvers and John Payne, and 20th Century-Fox said, 'Go,' '' Mr. Cook said. ''I think 'Star Time' would do for the 1940's what 'The Boy Friend' did for the 1920's.'' It would, that is, if it got produced. But as someone once said, theater is made up of dreams that come true.\nDespite what some people think - because he usually has his 10 fingers in 50 pies - there's only one Joseph Papp, at least at the New York Shakespeare Festival and the Public Theater.\nMr. Papp's latest project is an oral history that will explore his life in the theater through three decades of controversy and celebration. It will also include firsthand accounts from the people who made the festival come to life - stagehands, performers, politicians and corporate leaders. The history, which will be written with the journalist Kenneth Turan, is to be published in hard cover by Bantam Books in 1989.\nWhy another book on theater? Mr. Papp knew you'd ask.\n''People might have asked why another theater when we started 30 years ago,'' he said. ''But we proved we had something different to offer, and I'm confident the book will do the same.''
233	ART: 17 EARLY PAINTINGS BY GERHARD RICHTER	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DE163EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THE exhibition of Gerhard Richter's early work at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery (99 Greene Street) reveals only the tip of the iceberg of this West German artist's polymorphous production. Nonetheless, the 17 paintings on view (through Jan. 17), made between 1964 and 1974, constitute the largest group of Richter's work from this period ever exhibited in New York.\nTHE exhibition of Gerhard Richter's early work at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery (99 Greene Street) reveals only the tip of the iceberg of this West German artist's polymorphous production. Nonetheless, the 17 paintings on view (through Jan. 17), made between 1964 and 1974, constitute the largest group of Richter's work from this period ever exhibited in New York. They provide important background material on an artist who, despite his considerable reputation, is something of an enigma here.\nDuring the period covered by this show, European painting was not getting a lot of play in New York; Conceptual Art and Process Art were the imports of choice. Richter, who was born in Dresden in 1932 and emigrated from East to West Germany in 1961, had his first one-person show in Dusseldorf in 1963; but he did not have a solo exhibition in New York until 1978. At that point he proceeded to become quite well known for big, hotly colored gestural abstractions (which always managed to be oddly photographic in their spatial effects) and for photo-based landscapes and paintings of lighted candles.\nThis exhibition establishes that the polarities of Richter's art have long been the photographic image at one extreme and pure painting, as material and process, at the other. And it shows several of the ways Richter has worked back and forth between the two, in the process irrevocably blurring the distinction between abstraction and representation, as have many other artists his age and younger.\nRichter emerges here as an artist who fits in at several points in the terrain of American art; his work relates to Photo-Realism, Pop Art and Minimalism. He is also an early appropriator, for the most part using only existing images and configurations in his work.\nWhen he wants to paint a landscape, Richter copies a page from a guidebook onto a canvas, captions and all. ''Egyptian Landscape'' of 1964 gives us four views of ancient sites isolated on a ground of creamy white paint as if on a big page. This painting brings to mind the 1960's transcriptions of shipboard postcards by Malcolm Morley, who also brought a distinctly cerebral edge to Photo Realism.\nWhen Richter makes an abstract painting, it, too, often has a real-life source: two of the abstract paintings here are based on enlarged copies of a paint company's color charts, reproducing exactly the hard shiny look of paint chips. Left to his own devices, without an image to work from, Richter can emphasize process to the exclusion of all else. ''Gray,'' a painting that is not as interesting to look at as most others here, but that provides important clues to Richter's sensibility, is simply a large canvas covered with thick brushstrokes of gray paint.\nRichter balances most precisely the two extremes of his art in ''Townscape PL'' of 1970. Here, working from an aerial view of a city, he creates a sloshy network of grisaille brushstrokes that, without yielding precise information, leave no question about the image's source.\nEverywhere precise depiction is alluded to and then thwarted. A favorite device is to pull what artists call a blending brush across a realistic image so that it acquires a horizontal blur, reminding us that the image is paint, nothing but paint. This occurs in the aforementioned ''Egyptian Landscape,'' in the 1971 portrait of Brigid Polk (done from a Polaroid photo) and in the particularly wonderful ''Alfa Romeo (With Text)'' of 1965. Here the blurring of the car's image makes the vehicle seem to be moving, a suggestion of speed that contrasts absolutely with the slow methodical painting of the text that fills the left side of the canvas.\nIn other paintings, especially the 1967 ''Lamp'' and the 1969 ''Sea Piece (Gray-Green, Cloudy),'' it is the depiction of light that blurs and distorts the image, reminding us once more of its painted state.\nThis is a show that starts out cold but ends up rather hot, and it is Richter's attention to the various painted states of his images that raises the temperature. His impersonal coolness is so consistent that it has become the unifying characteristic of his highly diverse art, and this is understandable. But spend some time with these paintings, and their coolness gives way to a workmanlike but subtly impassioned rendering in which research and improvisation meet and the hand has its say. Also of interest this week: Richard Tuttle (Blum Helman, 20 West 57th Street): Richard Tuttle's scrappy little wall sculptures, fashioned out of cardboard, Styrofoam and bits of wire and wood and then brightly painted, continue to be an affront to well-made, heavy, expensive-looking art, of which there is much these days.\nOn first encounter, Tuttle's delicate constructions could be the work of an exceptionally talented child or naive artist; they seem to be the kind of work that even a mother might inadvertently toss out. But second or third encounters overturn these impressions and suggest that Tuttle is pursuing his own eccentric brand of Minimalism, a highly individualized argument concerning how less can be more both esthetically and ecologically.\nHis ''less'' lies in his use of materials that are modest, inartistic and virtually biodegradable, in his avoidance of overt craftsmanship and in his reliance on an intimate scale that brings the viewer up close to his works. His ''more'' emanates from his vibrant color, the energetic quirkiness of his forms, and the unexpected way these structures, so seemingly abstract, coalesce into semi-legible images: his ship at sea, a red-roofed house beside a row of trees, a possible parrot.\nUnderlying all this seems to be the insistence that valuable visual perceptions should have as little as possible to do with obvious measures of value. Thus an art that seems to be purely formal and exceedingly poetic comes around to the political by the back door. (Through tomorrow.) ''Text and Image: The Wording of American Art'' (Holly Solomon Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street): This is an exhibition of some 40 artists who, one way or another, have incorporated language into their art. It spans the generations from Stuart Davis and Robert Motherwell through Jasper Johns and Nancy Graves to such recently emerged East Village talents as Peter Nagy and Tim Rollins and K.O.S. Along the way, styles as diverse as Pop, Conceptual and graffiti art are represented. Although it comes on like a year's-end hodgepodge, it adds up to a rather carefully selected survey. Words, it turns out, have served American artists well, and vice-versa.\nSome of them, such as Jenny Holzer, Jonathan Borofsky and William Wegman, use words to tell a story or deliver a message. Others, such as Davis and Judy Pfaff, use single words for their decorative, streetwise punch. Still others do a little of both -Barbara Kruger, Ed Ruscha, Robert Indiana and Neil Jenney, in particular. In certain extreme instances, such as the work of Lawrence Weiner and Joseph Kosuth, what you read is what you get (to paraphrase Frank Stella). In their pieces, language is used almost as abstractly as the black square in a painting by Malevich.\nThe exhibition's highlights are many, and include the Davis painting ''Untitled (Variation on Pochade),'' a late work in which his usual jostling forms are outlined in black on bare white canvas; Larry Rivers's endearing ''Brushed Camel'' (after the cigarette), and, of particular interest, a little-known painting from 1968 by John Baldessari. Titled ''A 1968 Painting,'' it combines its name with a grisaille rendition of a Stella protractor painting; from certain angles, especially a post-Modernist one, this work looks extremely up to date. (Through tomorrow.)
234	ART: 'THE WINDOW' IN 20TH-CENTURY WORKS	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DE163EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: ON view at the Neuberger Museum of the State University of New York at Purchase, ''The Window in 20th-Century Art'' sounds like but is not an inventory. On the other hand, the project may well have started out that way, for it has the feel of an idea that grew and changed shape in the course of its realization.\nON view at the Neuberger Museum of the State University of New York at Purchase, ''The Window in 20th-Century Art'' sounds like but is not an inventory. On the other hand, the project may well have started out that way, for it has the feel of an idea that grew and changed shape in the course of its realization.\nOrganized by the museum's director, Suzanne Delehanty, the show consists of about 80 paintings and sculptures, most of them done by Americans working in the second half of the century. Its range is, nevertheless, remarkable - from a small Vuillard, circa 1900, of a window looking out onto a garden, to a couple of Joseph Cornell boxes; from Edward Hopper's voyeuristic ''Night Windows'' to Marcel Duchamp's ''Fresh Widow,'' a miniature set of French windows with panes ''glazed'' in black leather that is a 1964 replica of the 1920 original.\nThere are windows reflected on the grass at night (Robert Berlind), and on a polished wood floor in the daytime(Sylvia Plimack Mangold); windows implied - a classic Mark Rothko - and a splashy blue rectangle on a white ground that was done by Gene Davis in his Abstract Expressionist period. Add to these, analogies for windows such as Roy Lichtenstein's painting of a stretcher frame, complete with wedges, and Eva Hesse's wash drawings of positive and negative grids.\nWith his ''Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even'' painted on glass, Duchamp shares - with Christo, who is represented by one of his 1960's storefront mockups - the prize for the most real window. Competing for ''most realistic'' window are the photographic painters Richard Estes and Don Eddy with, respectively, a row of telephone booths outside a glass and metal diner, and a store window crammed with awful shoes. The shoes seem to rivet the attention of Henry Geldzahler, whose 1968-69 portrait by David Hockney hangs opposite.\nBut they won't do so for long since it's obvious that the then-champion of Pop, who sits at the exact center of a voluptuous pink sofa with Manhattan visible through the dusty window behind him, is about to give audience to young Christopher Scott, who stands at attention to his left. Balthus's young woman seems ready to leave her room by way of the window, perhaps to elude the assailant who has bared one of her breasts. Magritte's green apple, on the other hand, has grown too large to escape its space -through either the window or the door that it is presumably obstructing.\nA show that encompasses Robert Delaunay, Richard Diebenkorn, Neil Jenney, Ellsworth Kelly, Matisse, Robert Motherwell and Picasso, among others, it is essentially a survey of individualism, and as such resists grading. But as far as the theme is concerned, Magritte is the star with his ''Evening Falls.'' This is the famous canvas that would have been a picture of a sunset painted on a window, except that the window has been shattered. Accordingly, the simulacrum lies in pieces on the floor, while the original outside remains intact.\nA verbal-visual pun that brings on intellectual vertigo if contemplated too long, the work is the anthology's clincher. Still, only those privy to the catalogue essays by the curator and by Shirley Neilsen Blum, who teaches art history at the state university, would know it and therefore realize that the exhibition actually stands for the denouement of a drama that began with the Renaissance. For it was then that the canvas was first treated as a window and that artists, intoxicated by the invention of perspective, painted the world as if they viewed it through a window. And, as Ms. Blum points out, it's a tidy little world with a place for everything, human and divine, and an abundance of windows, most of which frame peep shows replete with moral implications.\nThe canvas-as-window concept persisted until the late 19th century, but by the Baroque period, the windows depicted are less likely to enclose moral lessons than to be the sources of the light that illuminates morality, as in the work of Rembrandt and Zurbaran. Languishing during the 18th century, the image made a comeback during the romantic era, but its trail is hard to follow. Ms. Blum cites Caspar David Friedrich for treating the window as a kind of partition between the real and the ineffable, but doesn't comment on romantics such as Delacroix and Turner, who, more or less his contemporaries, seem to have ignored its significance altogether.\nTheir essays overlapping, the writers differ slightly as to the window's importance to the Impressionists and their successors. But they agree that while perspective, already moribund by the late 1800's, died well before World War I (its tyranny replaced by that of the artists, notes Ms. Blum), the window lives on.\nThe question is whether the device has any special significance today -with or without perspective. Not surprisingly, Ms. Delehanty says it has and, in her essay, charts the ups and downs of its survival in some detail, taking note of its rejection by some though not all of the Cubists, its transformation by Matisse, its rejection again by the Formalists and, finally, the acceptance it is currently enjoying. She also takes care of a myriad of loose ends, including those contemporaries who take the Renaissance tradition seriously and those who use it to ironic ends.\nThe historian who would impose order on chaos risks tortuousness, and Ms. Delehanty is no exception. There are moments when the reader is hard put to tell whether she is discussing the format or the object itself. More perplexing, though, is that both writers, having given the familiar story of disintegration a new twist, should resort to the convention of an upbeat ending, as if the very individualism that had caused the chaos will some day, somehow cure it.\nA show that is as stimulating as the arguments for it, ''The Window'' closes at the Neuberger on Jan. 18. It then reopens at Houston's Contemporary Arts Museum in April. Also of interest this week: John Alexander (Marlboro Gallery, 40 West 57th Street): John Alexander is a figurative Expressionist who keeps a foot in the Abstract Expressionist camp. Which is to say that his scenes - a banquet, a dance, a cockfight, tropical swamps inhabited by brightly colored birds and fish - are deliberately composed. And for all their apparent spontaneity, his impastoes of rich color are consciously and skillfully applied. The automatism is in the slanting lines with which the artist garnishes the finished work. In images such as the crucifixion - where the figure, a black man wearing little more than tribal markings, is surrounded by baboons similarly adorned - the mannerism works if only because the lines, despite the birds perched on them, suggest spears. It also heightens the menace of the dark woods filled with bogymen that are closing in on a white woman in full bridal fig. She appears not to have all her oars in the water, which may explain the scene's title, ''Waiting in the Wrong Woods.'' But in ''Christina's World,'' which features a black queen who, attired in sumptuous yellow robes, sits on a throne holding a green monkey on her lap, the lines are a tiresome distraction.\nAlexander paints and draws animals with genuine affection, but, like Donald Roller Wilson, he also uses them to emphasize the satirical thrust of his figure compositions and frequently cartoons his black figures for the same purpose. Each of the black priests watching monkeys advance on the corpse of a white burgher-type man lying in state has the same all-purpose caricature for a face. The artist himself is black, and it is black subject-matter (if not always black subjects), animals and in particular the skull of a deer that have inspired the best paintings. (Through Saturday.) Justen Ladda (Museum of Modern Art): The third in the museum's Projects series, Justen Ladda's installation is titled ''Art, Fashion and Religion.'' Ladda is yet another young artist impelled to expose the self-evident - in this case, that consumerism makes the world go round. But visually, at least, he does so with a touch of humor.\nVisitors enter the installation through a mazelike passage, the white walls of which are divided at waist height by a continuous band of Greek-key ornamentation made of wood painted black. Every few feet the frieze is interrupted by a frame containing a bunch of pale green grapes painted on a white ground. The bunch diminishes grape by grape until nothing is left but the black stalks - ''a souvenir of the act of eating,'' according to the brochure statement contributed by Wendy Weitman, who is assistant curator in the museum's department of prints and illustrated books.\nBy now, the spectator has reached the semicircular room containing the main attraction. This is a tableau deployed on a floor paved with asymmetrical wood crosses - chunky variations on the swastika, painted bright colors. The white walls are patterned with lines of regular crosses in black and are flanked with plain white columns. In the middle is Michelangelo's Pieta sprayed in gray over a pile of empty white cardboard boxes. Lurking between the columns, meanwhile, are female store-dummies clad in black or gold lame suits, and the whole scene is illuminated by spotlights and fluorescent bars of deep purple.\nOnce again, Miss Weitman comes to the rescue. ''The fast changing trends we have come to accept in fashion,'' she says, ''have become the norm in contemporary society's attitudes toward art and religion.''\nThe giant housefly that Ladda installed in an empty swimming pool for a 1982 show at Wave Hill may or may not have been a comment on what he calls ''belief systems.'' But the Museum of Modern Art production leaves no doubt that the artist is now one of a growing band intent on using Pop Art to didactic ends. It is enough to make survivors of the original Pop feel like old Regency rakes confronted by the dawn of the Victorian era.

What's more, the club's recently revamped public restaurant, called Water's\nA YACHT club on the industrial waterfront of Queens may seem as improbable as a polo field on Wall Street, but there it sits, all cool-white and glassy, offering a stunning panorama of midtown Manhattan across the East River. What's more, the club's recently revamped public restaurant, called Water's Edge, can be surprisingly good.\nThe young chef, Gregory Godon, formerly of La Cote Basque, turns out an ambitious - perhaps too ambitious at times - range of seafood, game and meat entrees, some peppered with a Cajun touch. The service is a little wobbly at times, and prices are hardly provincial (count on about $50 a person with wine); but if you seek generally pleasing fare in a romantic waterside setting, Water's Edge is worth adding to your ports of call.\nThe gentrified main room is a curious mix of sleek marine white and somber men's club oak that was imported to lend an air of seriousness to the space. The result, though, is a jarring hodgepodge. Severe, high-backed Victorian-style chairs add to the dignified discomfort. Tables are generously spaced to allow privacy. An upstairs banquet room seats 600.\nBy sticking to the most straightforward preparations and avoiding whimsical sauces and pastas, you should do fine. One could start with potent dill-infused gravlax or superior smoked tuna accompanied by lemon, capers and a mild horseradish-cream sauce. My favorite appetizer is called Cape Cod chili. It is an unlikely combination of beans, lobster, shrimp and scallops in a rousing hot sauce foiled with a touch of sweetness from the onions. Grilled peppered salmon sounded tempting but was overcooked.\nCommon sense told me to steer away from pesto when basil was out of season, but professional duty dictated otherwise. Skip it. Gnocchi in a supercharged garlic-tomato sauce was about as delicately subtle as a supertanker, advisable only for the most ardent garlic fans.\nThe chef is conscientious about the quality of his seafood, and it is best when garnished least. Among the recommended dishes are a thick plank of grilled yellowfin tuna painted with sweetish hoisin sauce, sauteed Dover sole garnished with rings of sweet red peppers, and an exceptionally zesty rendition of blackened snapper - it was zippy with pepper but not burned, as it so often is elsewhere. Poached salmon was cooked to a turn, but its lobster sauce, speckled with black truffles, was utterly bland; the same fate met sauteed lobster meat under a lavalike cream sauce purportedly seasoned with sea urchin. All entrees are served with rice and tasty firm-cooked julienne of carrots.\nThe wine list is scattered and uneven, but there are enough reasonably priced bottles to meet most needs. One vexing service practice is that after pouring the wine, waiters place the bottle in a storage bucket far from your table. Invariably, when you want some wine, no one is around to retrieve it.\nSimple steaks and chops are reliably good; two exceptional entrees are the rack of lamb over well-seasoned hot lentils, and a special, venison steak in a faintly sweet stock sauce replete with meaty shiitaki mushrooms.\nFor dessert, you can't go wrong with the splendid tarte tatin featuring caramelized apples and almond slivers, excellent pecan pie built on a layer of bittersweet chocolate, or rich and intense chocolate mousse cake. Amaretto cream cake is lightweight and excessively sweet, while cheesecake is dry and commercial-tasting.\nYou don't need a yacht to partake in this club -the subway will get you there. For a change of pace and crow's-nest views, I suggest you make the crossing.\nWhat the Upper West Side sorely needs is an authentic French brasserie. It should be a bright and bustling place that is open at all hours, serves wholesome and unfussy fare and good table wines and provides snappy service. That is not what the neighborhood got when Brasserie Bijou opened two months ago in the former Ruelle's on Columbus Avenue.\nIt looks like a brasserie, all right, with its airy belle epoque interior sporting lots of brass and glass, cane chairs, twirling fans and Ionic columns. A central staircase makes a dramatic sweep to a second-floor dining room. Even the service staff in long white aprons fits the part. The downfall is the menu, which carries too many dishes that are barely a notch above run-of-the-mill Columbus Avenue pub grub.\nThis is all the more surprising because the owners, who had a timely idea in converting undistinguished Ruelle's into something more exciting, recruited as chef Shirley King, formerly of Wilkinson's Seafood Cafe. Perhaps the burden of high-volume cooking at this busy new place is taking its toll, or maybe the kitchen staff is unsteady; whatever, out of some dozen meals sampled, more than half were disappointing.\nAppetizers are slightly better than main courses. Baked mussels stuffed with basil-and-garlic butter are aromatic and fresh, and the house terrine is well turned out, rough textured and full flavorerd. Another winner is snails nestled against a cloud of puff pastry surrounded by a moat of light garlic cream sauce dotted with chopped endive. Don't bother with the tasteless salad over artichoke bottoms in a supermarket-quality dressing; the kitchen's attempt to replicate a popular French salad combining lettuce, bacon and poached egg is a sodden mess - even the poached egg is overcooked. A special soup of the day, blending potatoes, ham and cabbage, was a near miss - all it needed was a bit of seasoning to offset the salty ham.\nThe young service staff is doing its best under fire, and it manages to keep the pace moving along. The wine list is well chosen and moderately priced; plenty of good selections can be found for less than $20.\nLack of seasoning drags down many of the seafood entrees. A seafood cassoulet with French flageolet beans served in a crock was viscous and bland; on two occasions hefty grilled shrimp were perfectly cooked but the advertised wasabi-mustard-and-ginger sauce must have evaporated on the way from the kitchen. Grilled swordfish, a special, was moist and tasty with its backdrop of mixed Oriental vegetables. I would play it safe and avoid pastas, based on the one I sampled - a cloying and oversalted blend of cream, smoked salmon and salmon roe.\nOn the landlubber side of the menu, grilled baby lamb chops in a light thyme sauce were right on the mark, pink, buttery tender and accompanied by a crispy potato cake. A soothing winter special was pot-au-feu combining tender, sinewy beef brisket, cabbage, carrots and potatoes. Coarse salt and horseradish came with it. On the debit side are a remarkably tasteless steak and limp french fries and the dry veal with chestnut puree.\nAside from a good buttery almond cake, most of the desserts are not worth the guilt.\nThe Upper West Side needs another overstriving French restaurant about as much as Central Park needs a condominium development.

Of course not! Would a Frenchman's knowledge of Shakespeare be of any assistance in New York's subways?\nAnyone trying to get around in a foreign country needs a working knowledge of conversation and more conversation, not the classics. To order from a menu, one has to converse with the waiter; to find the best way to the Louvre, one converses with a passerby. The same applies when shopping where English is not spoken.\nI have an infallible, convenient and cheap way to brush up on my French, German or Spanish. I read detective stories. Any good whodunit is replete with conversation and enriched by contemporary idioms and slang that I can incorporate into my own vocabulary. Two pages of Georges Simenon or a French translation of a Perry Mason will reward the reader with more spoken French than a novel by Victor Hugo. Such an exercise can warm up even a knowledge of French that is only fairly adequate.\nA final warning. Do not waste your time reading foreign newspapers. Their French is not the language people use while strolling down the Rue de Rivoli. ADOLF C. ROBISON Teaneck, N.J., Dec. 21, 1986
237	For a Little More Truth In Legislative Labeling	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DC163EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: To the Editor:\nTo the Editor:\nNew York State legislators excel at inventing misleading descriptions of their proposals, but we expect you to call a spade a spade - and not to call a proposed tax measured by the value of automobiles a ''real property tax'' (''Paying for Transit Once a Year,'' Dec. 21).\nAccording to the Random House Dictionary of the English Language, ''real property'' is ''an estate or property consisting of lands and of all appurtenances to lands, as buildings, crops or mineral rights (distinguished from personal property).'' Autos are in no way ''appurtenances to lands.''\nThe proposed tax may or may not be good, but it does not help to label it as something familiar to ordinary people and presumably more acceptable than a personal-property tax, which was ended decades ago in New York State.

238	National Service Is a Mask of the Welfare State	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DC163EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: To the Editor:\nTo the Editor:\n''The Promise of National Service'' (editorial, Dec. 10) describes national service glowingly, as a panacea for disaffected youth and a host of other social problems. Beware the plan that sounds too good to be true; strip away the altruism and behold a monster.\nNational-service programs promise to turn alienated and troublesome young people into useful citizens. At the risk of sounding cynical, I doubt the success rate would be high, not to mention cost-effective. But more frightening and insidious is the message - that social programs would succeed where families have failed.\nNational-service advocates recognize that many 16- to 25-year-olds are adrift, ''beset with purposelessness.'' But will national service help a young person come to grips with the hard choices of those years, like education, training, entry jobs and childbearing, or will they just postpone reality? Will national service ''volunteer'' jobs instill discipline or the work ethic necessary in the job market? If these values have not been learned at home at an early age, will they be inculcated by one year of volunteer service? More cruelly, you say the program will give ''young people a sense that society needs and wants them.'' Can such a promise be delivered? Again, can a social program succeed where a family has failed?\nNational-service advocates would seduce us by painting pictures of wayward youth from a variety of backgrounds living and working together to care for the elderly, for example, or to clean up debris in parks. But these problems might not be so severe if family life played a more central role in society. Sadly, family structure has deteriorated over the decades as personal accountability has slipped away from the individual into the quagmire of social programs.\nSo take the pretty mask off the national-service promise and expose the culprit for what it is - the face of the welfare state - the historical rival of the family.

239	What's So Good About Traditional Male Violence?; Cultural Bias in Action	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DC163EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: To the Editor:\nTo the Editor:\nPerhaps the most disturbing aspect of your article on boyhood effeminacy and later homosexuality is the refusal to question any of the premises upon which Dr. Green bases his study of 44 ''sissy boys.''\nThis pejorative and objectionable term reflects Dr. Green's dependence on a retrograde vocabulary and culturally imposed attitudes, which both the feminist and gay-rights movements of the last two decades have fought so hard to amend. Equally disturbing, you never attempt to place the study in the context of the longstanding sociological and psychological debate about rigid, traditional gender roles and a felicitous childhood development.\nThe study grandly generalizes from a very small sample of young boys who ''persistently act like girls.'' Your reporter bandies about phrases like ''more conventional masculine behavior'' and ''gender-appropriate'' activities, yet spends no time - as neither, one assumes, did Dr. Green - questioning the cultural meanings ascribed to such words. For what is ''conventional'' or ''gender-appropriate'' is always a judgment made within a specific cultural context, Occidental or Oriental, rural or urban.\nOne unspoken conclusion in the article is that to be ''effeminate'' as a boy, posing as it does the hidden threat of future homosexuality, is always a negative. To be ''like a girl'' is likewise proved a constant cultural minus when Dr. Green remarks that tomboys - girls who act like boys -''are treated by society as normal girls.'' Thus, what is normal and better is the perceived ''masculine'' tendency; the ''feminine'' one is viewed as inferior, a negative.\nSimone de Beauvoir in ''The Second Sex'' argued this case far more completely nearly 30 years ago, yet Dr. Green and your reporter use their terms with not the least irony. Nor does your reporter place in context the arena of behavioral vs. biological vs. cultural gender-role battles fought over the last 20 years, thanks largely to a feminist refusal to accept entrenched social attitudes that limit the realization of each child's full human potential.\nNeither Dr. Green nor your writer uses words like tenderness, trust, honesty, selflessness, valor or generosity to discuss gender-neutral values whose importance to childhood development should override culturally imposed boy-girl patterns.\nThere is no indication to show what Dr. Green's study finds noble in such traditional boyhood ''masculine'' activities as ''rough and tumble'' play bordering on physical aggression, make-believe war games and male group dynamics, where survival of the fittest is a measure of ''masculine'' prowess and control. The issue is always seen through but one end of the telescope, for the study as described, though it does not blame ''effeminate'' boys, seeks to show why they ''have difficulty making friends with the other boys'' when it would be equally valuable to know why ''other boys'' are not encouraged to make friends with them.\nFinally, the article is evidence of the frightened need in our society for so-called ''experts'' to quantify, analyze, record and interpret the lives of gay men and lesbians. But your reporter includes not one response from a gay man or lesbian. We have a great deal to teach others about tolerance, love and friendship.\nMillions are spent to reassure the worried parent that ''it's not really your fault,'' but not one cent goes to research the persistent cultural phobia that kills and maims, physically and spiritually, and produces destructive sexual bigots, first among children, then among the adults they grow into.

Between 1978 and 1985, employer agencies in the state obtained rate reduction from the employees retirement system of more than $2 billion. None of this went to state retirees. Comptroller Edward V. Regan has released a report showing a drastic reduction in the cost of state retiree pensions from 22.4 percent of payroll in 1978 to the 15.5 percent estimated for this state fiscal year. Legislators can no longer ignore the need to supplement the pensions of state public servants. WILLIAM H. GINSBERG Director, New York State Retirees Public Employees Federation New York, Dec. 9, 1986
241	AUCTIONS	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DB163EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: DID Capt. John Tittle bring back two large Swedish earthenware trays, awash with images of Roman ruins, from his European voyages in the 1780's - and did he then have Chippendale table bases made for them? Were tray-top tables all the rage in the late 18th century in Beverly, Mass., where he lived?\nDID Capt. John Tittle bring back two large Swedish earthenware trays, awash with images of Roman ruins, from his European voyages in the 1780's - and did he then have Chippendale table bases made for them? Were tray-top tables all the rage in the late 18th century in Beverly, Mass., where he lived?\nThese are some of the questions raised this week in advance of the auction today of a curious tray table, which is like one that was once owned by Captain Tittle and that now dominates an alcove at the Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum in Delaware. The sale begins at 10 A.M. at the Robert W. Skinner gallery in Bolton, Mass.\n''I think there is no question that they are companions,'' Albert Sack, the New York dealer, said this week of the two look-alike tables. ''There may have been others - but so far only two have surfaced. The table at Skinner's is a rarity - a great rarity. It belongs in an important collection. The table has the original finish; you can't fault it.''\nIn 1964, when Henry du Pont purchased the tray-table that's now at the Winterthur Museum, only his version was known. Nancy Goyne Evans, senior registrar at the museum, recalled this week that she researched the table and found that the bright pink faience top was probably made at Rorstrand, a factory near Stockholm. She said that Captain Tittle made many European voyages and visited Sweden at least once, in 1788.\n''They come from the same design sources,'' she said of the two ceramic trays, adding that the one at Skinner differs in several minor ways - the top is polychromed and has a different picture of ancient ruins. Mrs. Evans said that both of the mahogany tables were made by a sophisticated craftsman. ''You can see how the cabinetmaker picks up on the rounded corners of the tray and follows this through in the shaping of the frame, the lip of the table, and the legs,'' she said. ''There is this magnificent coordination. The maker was not any country yokel.''\nBoth tables descended in Massachusetts families. The Skinner version was owned in the 19th century by Augustus Flagg, who became president of Little, Brown & Company in 1869 and died in 1903. The widow of Flagg's great-grandson, whose name has not been disclosed, is the consignor of the table, according to Skinner's.\nStephen Fletcher, Skinner's furniture specialist, was at Winterthur this week checking out the similarities and differences between the two tables. Mr. Fletcher said that the table in the sale had handles on the side and that the pierced detailing differed slightly on the two tables.\nAt Tittle's death in 1800, an inventory listed a table presumed to be the one at Winterthur as ''cover'd with China'' and valued at $4.50. Winterthur officials decline to disclose what Mr. du Pont paid for the museum's table. Skinner expects that the one up for sale will bring between $60,000 and $80,000. Elsholz Collection Of Glass Pieces American glass enthusiasts were out in force last month at the Richard A. Bourne galleries in Hyannis, Mass., attending the two-day sale of William J. Elsholz's collection of early-19th-century works. The assemblage of 700 clear and brilliantly colored glass vessels, whale-oil lamps and decorations represents one-third of the Elsholz collection, which experts have described as one of the most important to be auctioned in recent years. Mr. Elsholz, a Detroit accountant and pioneer collector of this period of glass, began acquiring pieces in 1930 and continued until shortly before his death last June at the age of 93. The remainder of the collection of more than 2,000 pieces will be sold in May and next fall at Bourne.\nMajor examples of pressed, free-blown and mold-blown glass, produced between 1815 and 1860 by factories throughout New England, the mid-Atlantic states and the Middle West, brought extraordinary prices at the auction, which totaled $717,000. Among the most desirable selections were lacy, lily-pad, hobnail and ripple-patterned works.\nAccording to Richard A. Bourne, interest in this glass has changed dramatically in recent years. At the peak of Mr. Elsholz's collecting, he said, prices were much lower and there were many more competitors. ''Virtually everyone who buys today was here,'' the auctioneer said, noting that the gathering was relatively small - about 200 collectors and dealers. There were also fewer telephone bids and order bids from absentee buyers than is usually the case at his sales, he reported.\nStuart Feld of Hirschl & Adler, the New York dealers, was a major buyer, acquiring several of the most important works. He bought the largest known free-blown pitcher in lily-pad decoration, a globular-shaped aquamarine glass vessel that holds four quarts. He paid $19,000, a record at auction for lily-pad patterned glass.\nMr. Feld also purchased a rare glass bank that looks more like a brandy bottle than a coin repository, from its stopper-like ball at the top on which a glass chicken perches, to its footed base. The 11-inch-tall free-blown vessel, which has a coin buried in the nob-top and in the ball at the base, is the only known survivor of this egg-shaped form. It was sold for $6,500, almost three times what such banks usually bring.\nMr. Feld said he bought these and other glass items for his new gallery, Hirschl & Adler Folk, which will open in April at 851 Madison Avenue, at 70th Street. The second-floor gallery, adjoining Mr. Feld's Hirschl & Adler Modern, will be under the direction of Frank J. Miele, a lawyer and folk-art collector.\nA brilliant blue vegetable dish on a hexagonal base was purchased by Nancy O. Merrill, curator of glass at the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Va., for $17,000, a record price at auction for sandwich glass.\nJ. Garrison Stradling, a New York glass dealer, purchased several window panes that were produced before the Civil War to be inset in doors and partitions. These are scarce items in the marketplace, he said, adding that the rarest and most expensive of these pressed-glass designs was made in Pittsburgh. The 7-inch-by-5-inch pane of stylized tulips framing elaborate S-scrolls brought $9,000.\n''It is the only one extant as far as I know,'' Mr. Stradling said. ''A lot of the Elsholz collection is very esoteric material. I wondered whether there would be enough money to support this sale in glass. The serious buying proved that there are buyers for the best.''

243	MOMIX DANCE TROUPE: SURREALISTIC IMAGES	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DA163EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Moses Pendleton was having a chat the other day in the staid lobby of the Algonquin Hotel when he suddenly whipped out a camera, detonated a flashbulb and took the photograph of an unsuspecting man across the room, who was quietly reading a newspaper.\nMoses Pendleton was having a chat the other day in the staid lobby of the Algonquin Hotel when he suddenly whipped out a camera, detonated a flashbulb and took the photograph of an unsuspecting man across the room, who was quietly reading a newspaper.\n''Lip-synching,''Mr. Pendleton intoned, pointing out that the man was moving his lips. ''It's an image I'd like to study at home.''\nThe man across the room never noticed, but it was a telling moment for Mr. Pendleton, 37 years old, the artistic director of Momix, a dance company whose choreography revolves around perpetually shifting imagery.\nNot long from now, moving lips might well appear in one of Mr. Pendleton's ballets.\nTomorrow night Momix opens at the 92d Street Y with an eclectic pastiche that includes two partly nude dancers whose movements are confined because they are wearing downhill skis; a man who cannot move without a mammoth gyroscope; a woman encased in a dress that never touches her skin; dancers trapped in a giant shell, and a man on stilts who transforms himself into the steeple of a church. 'A Form of Surrealism'\n''Momix deals with shifting identities,'' said Mr. Pendleton, who lives and works in a 30-room mansion in Washington, Conn. ''It's a form of Surrealism in which you might see a woman on the body of a cat.''\nMr. Pendleton, who was the co-founder of Pilobolus - the dance troupe founded at Dartmouth College in 1971 and known for its ability to create illusions and intricate metaphors out of body shapes - said he saw Momix as an outgrowth of that earlier company.\nPilobolus, which was co-founded by Jonathan Wolken, was originally composed of such dancers as Martha Clarke, Robby Barnett, Alison Chase and Michael Tracy, all of whom have since gone their separate ways.\nMr. Pendleton founded Momix in 1980 and named it after a solo he did for Pilobolus in which he wore a dramatic white outfit and Panama hat. If there was any key difference between Pilobolus and his current company of about 10 dancers, Mr. Pendleton said, it was that Pilobolus featured choreography requiring a collective effort by dancers, whereas Momix emphasizes the solo performance.\n''It's almost opposite of the group works of Pilobolus,'' Mr. Pendleton said, adding quickly that he disliked describing what Momix was because its identity was always changing and fluidity was at the dance company's core. Time With His Daughter\nMr. Pendleton said he did not know from one moment to the next whether he would continue to perform. Although he still loves to dance, he hates to travel, and since performance is synonymous with travel he prefers to stay at home, dance in front of the fireplace and compose new works. Photography has become a major new interest, Mr. Pendleton said, as has spending time with his 6-month-old daughter, Quinn Elizabeth Pendleton, and her mother, the Momix dancer Cynthia Quinn.\n''Dancing for me was always mostly child's play,'' said Mr. Pendleton, speaking of his daughter. ''She reminds me of that.''\nWith that, he reached for a tape recorder. He said he wanted not only to remember what he said, but also to be able to ponder it.\n''Unlike Pilobolus, the extension in Momix is not into another body but a prop,'' Mr. Pendleton said. ''Like a clamshell opening and closing as being an extension of a yawn.''\nExpanding on the importance of props in his works, Mr. Pendleton then described the beginnings of an idea for a new work he said would be called ''TV Man.'' It was conceived, he said, with a longtime friend, the psychologist Dr. Robert Beck, and will be composed of some kind of creature whose giant head is a television monitor. 'Everything Is a Gimmick'\n''Imagine Ian McKellen performing Shakespeare,'' he said. ''He's this size but his head is. . . .'' Mr. Pendleton extended his hands, showing a head twice the size of his own.\n''I'm not sure yet if it will be a dance or whether he or she might be in the lobby selling Momix cassettes,'' Mr. Pendleton said. ''Instead of T-shirts maybe he'll sell bags of compost. It could catch on. It would be a joke, but jokes are recognition that once you're out of the taxicab, you're in the theater.''\nMr. Pendleton, who admittedly loves to talk, checked to see whether his tape recorder was working. It was.\n''Everything is a gimmick at first,'' he said. ''Then it grows. What is that TV man? What does he say? Does it dance? Maybe the body is primitive. Primal. Is it out of Egypt? Maybe it's an extension of your memory. At one point you can have a female head. A woman's body. Then a male's head. Is it an oval mirror? Can we cloak it properly? Make it medieval? Maybe it's a strange piece of sculpture that has a TV set as an eye.'' Stay tuned. Momix will perform at the Y (Lexington Avenue at 92d Street) tomorrow at 8 P.M., Sunday at 2 and 7 P.M., and Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 P.M. Tickets are $16. Information: 996-1100.

The place was the center's fifth floor, smack in the middle of which is a bulb-blazing, mirror-decorated carrousel.\nWhen the kids - the guests of honor, their brothers, sisters, friends and young-at-heart parents -weren't aboard the carrousel, they could be found oohing and ahing at the feats of Jim Brown, a magician, or gobbling hot dogs in the Carrousel Party Room. (The center rents the room for celebrations, $200 for three hours on weekends and $150 for three hours on weekdays. The carrousel, free to the public, is open from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. daily except Sunday, when the hours are noon to 6 P.M.) Five United States marines were there, too, to pick up gifts donated to Toys for Tots.\nAs for the youngsters, they wore their party best: the girls in velvet and lace, ruffles, frills and flounces, national costumes, black patent Mary Janes and fashion-forward footwear. The boys sported blazers or sweaters, baseball caps and coordinated bow ties and suspenders. The only thing missing, in fact, were some front teeth.
245	WALKER AND STROLLER COME IN FROM THE COLD	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D7163EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: NEW YORK in January is anything but a winter wonderland, as winds gain tornado force at skyscraper corners and sweep the streets clean of sidewalk vendors, bicycle messengers and pedestrians. In winter, the midtown streets, deep in holiday blahs and shorn of adornment, are for brisk movement rather than serendipitous dawdling - and thoughts turn to the great public interiors that serve as idyllic refuges.\nNEW YORK in January is anything but a winter wonderland, as winds gain tornado force at skyscraper corners and sweep the streets clean of sidewalk vendors, bicycle messengers and pedestrians. In winter, the midtown streets, deep in holiday blahs and shorn of adornment, are for brisk movement rather than serendipitous dawdling - and thoughts turn to the great public interiors that serve as idyllic refuges. Sometimes they feature entertainment or exhibitions, but whatever else they offer, they are warm, usually bright and clean enclaves ideal for resting while en route elsewhere, or as the meeting place that substitutes for a street corner or park where one would rendezvous in milder climate.\nThis was the matter under discussion by those two inveterate city prowlers, Weekend Walker and City Stroller, who were indeed making an issue of it as they occupied a table at one such haven, the Horn & Hardart Original Automat, at the corner of 42d Street and Third Avenue. They were vigorously debating the merits of hotel lobbies against the virtues of atriums as places where one might enjoy a respite from the outdoors, at a reasonable price, which, by the standards of this canny and streetwise pair, means that they are free.\nThe two argued on class lines - Walker the patrician, Stroller the proletarian - as they warmed themselves with coffee they had just cranked out of the automat spigot, which was activated by a coin. Both men were grateful for the survival of this last of the automat breed in an age dominated by those fast-food emporiums with narrow counters at which one sat on quick-getaway backless stools designed, it seemed, to bedevil the sacroiliac.\n''The automat has a special ambiance,'' said Walker. ''This one is more than a half-century old, younger than you or I, to be sure, and it still maintains the Art Deco motif, the sandwiches in the coin-operated glass cages and an atmosphere in which you do not have to move until others indicate that you are not eating and they, as cash customers, would like to have the table. It is also convenient to many estimable upwardly mobile hotel lobbies.''\n''Walker,'' answered Stroller, a New York cynic who knows where the line hits bottom, ''your pretensions are as high as the World Trade Center, but you still have a TKTS-line attitude that you want class at no cost. I've never felt at home in a hotel lobby, I must say. I like atriums and I love the automat. When I was a kid, I used to take the lemon pieces off the iced-tea glasses, mix them with water and enjoy a free lemonade. Until the manager kicked me out.''\n''And I am sure you have been booted out of better places, too,'' said Walker, reprov-ingly. ''There is something about a hotel lobby, a good hotel lobby, that brings with it a sense of dignity, an understanding that the wayfarer is a special person, entitled to the most sensitive treatment during his transit. I wish you had let me take you into the lobby of the United Nations Plaza, opposite that world body's headquarters, in that imposing combination office-cum-hotel-high-rise at 45th Street, just west of First Avenue. It's a modern but discreet lobby divided into sections, with a cosmopolitan custom in attendance. The couches and other seats are comfortable, and I could not hear a word of what I am sure were top-drawer confidences being passed between Very Important People.''\n''Confidences?'' said Stroller. ''I bet they stash lunch in the attache cases. The trouble with hotel lobbies is that they are for the guests of the hotel and maybe for the guests of the guests. I know it's an old New York game, lobby-sitting. You sit and stare at other people as though you belong and they do not belong. If I didn't know that you were genuinely a stuffed shirt, I would be tempted to call you a phony.''\nWalker bridled at the critique, but bridling is difficult in a busy automat. ''You know, Stroller, having coffee with you at Horn & Hardart is not like having dinner with Andre,'' he said, with what he considered a well-bred amusement. ''There are lobbies and there are lobbies. I should imagine that the new flamboyant Marriott Marquis, in Times Square at 45th Street, should appeal to you. It is clever and it is clean and bright. The lobby is on the eighth floor and you get to it by way of a central core of elevators. Each car is outlined in bright bulbs, not my thing, of course, but attractive in a brazen way. The lobby has become something of a public square. There are comfortable seats at the eastern end, a cocktail lounge, where you may be asked, but are not forced, to buy a drink. And there is a sort of ledge around the elevator core where everyone, it seems, sits and waits and looks.''\n''Oh, the Marriott is a nice addition,'' agreed Stroller. ''I still prefer, when meeting someone in the theater district, to meet at the Hotel Edison, which runs between 46th and 47th Street, just west of Broadway. It's a respectable old tourist hotel, a bit careworn, perhaps, and I particularly enjoy its 1930's panels. On the 47th Street side, there's a marvelous mirror hanging, on which there is etched an Art Deco scene of the city with the Brooklyn Bridge soaring over it. And you can sit there, listening to the reactions of the tourists to what they have seen in the city.''\nStroller was, for his age, a fellow who really couldn't sit long anywhere, and he suggested that they brave the cold and head for the Citicorp Center. Walker assented, and they buttoned up and headed east to Lexington Avenue, because Walker has a theory that Third Avenue's high-rises, along with those on the Avenue of the Americas, have created two of the fiercest wind tunnels known to man.\nIndeed, Lexington Avenue was no hothouse on that cold day, and at 45th Street, the two, with no discussion at all, decided to take a breather at the Park Avenue Atrium, which covers the block to 46th Street, between Lexington and Park. The building is 23 granite-faced stories high, but its 7,000-square-foot lobby seems suited to a much larger structure.\n''I must say, this is comparable with a good hotel lobby,'' conceded Walker as he gazed up at the lofty overhead into which the elevators, entirely visible, were disappearing with the speed and illumination of fireflies. ''In a nouveau way, I mean. They seem to have a reputable landscape gardener to judge by the foliage and shrubbery. I do think, however, that backless benches, even as handsome as these are, do not encourage long stays. Yet, it is one of the more scenic venues.''\n''It's O.K., a little stiff, maybe, but it's got a Charley O's, not that you go in for that sort of thing,'' said Stroller.\nBasking in new-found warmth, the two continued up the avenue. Stroller declined a pause at the Hotel Inter-Continental at 48th Street. He was not, in his windbreaker and stained trousers, appropriately accoutered for such an exalted setting.\n''Well, I am not sure I would want to be seen with you here, either,'' Walker acquiesced. ''But it is worth a look, and it is still five blocks to Citicorp. It is the only lobby I can think of that recalls, if modestly, those in the imperial hotels of the British Empire before the sun began setting on it.''\n''It's the lobby with the bird cage, I know it,'' said Stroller, as Walker pushed him past the doorman into the reception area. ''It's fine as long as we don't sit down. It's too posh for me.''\n''I don't know that they would discourage you from sitting in the lobby, even though your choice of colors would even clash with the Times Square IRT subway station,'' said Walker, indulgently. ''It is the ultimate in grace, with a half-dozen chandeliers, red leathery couches, comfortable armchairs, wood paneling, a cocktail mezzanine, and, as you coarsely put it, the bird cage. It is not just a common bird cage but a ceiling-high affair of metal wrought in the style of a 19th-century cage and staffed by two colorful birds that twitter.''\nThey were out almost as quickly as they had gone in, and trudged northward past the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria, that paragon of luxuriant hotel splendor at 50th Street. At 53d Street, they went down the steps into the main floor of Citicorp's Atrium, but not before scanning, as they always did, the architectural ingenuity of the 915-foot-tall building whose main tower is supported by 127-foot columns and is topped by a singular addition to the skyline, a slanted roof designed for solar power.\nThe Atrium was, as ever, alive with humanity, and the pair had difficulty in finding an unoccupied table, which they barely beat a slow-moving tourist trio to on the mezzanine. The floors are lined with stores, mostly food establishments, and linked by several banks of moving stairs. The seating is on serviceable chairs grouped around tables that are not immense but larger than those found in many nightclubs.\n''The passing scene is not without interest,'' observed Walker. ''It is an extremely mixed bag, secretaries, even hard hats from neighborhood construction jobs, lots of tourists. I shouldn't be surprised if those fellows in the expensive suits and speaking an incomprehensible tongue were hatching an arms deal.''\n''Arms deals are for hotel lobbies,'' said Stroller. ''They are probably tourists exchanging tips on best buys around town. This place has been in business nearly nine years now, the first of its kind, and it is a hit. They almost always have something performing at lunch time or at 5 P.M., and I can't think of a better place to kill time if you're short on cash. Also, it has clean restrooms, very important if you don't want to spend money in a bar to get the same facilities.''\n''It is odd how each atrium assumes its own character, almost as though it were a hotel lobby,'' mused Walker. ''I walked into the Park Avenue Plaza, at 55 East 52d Street, not to be confused with the Park Avenue Atrium we just visited. It is a big space, certainly, and it has seats in it, and in its corridors they have authors reading from their works from time to time. In December they had live music concerts. There is nothing wrong with it at all, but it does not attract the variety of life that Citicorp does, possibly because it is not on the main traffic route with a subway station in the basement.''\n''True,'' said Stroller. ''But that makes it more intimate and personal, which is what you say you like. I find it somewhat more lively in the Philip Morris building, on 42d and Park, opposite Grand Central Terminal. Grand Central, for sitting, gives you a complete slice of life, top to bottom, by the way, but it is not where you would like to spend much time. Philip Morris has a lobby full of sculpture, nice and bright and warm, with a one-room branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art attached. It has achieved its own popularity, not as kaleidoscopic as this one we're sitting in, but quite cosmopolitan.''\n''Do you feel like continuing our perambulation?'' asked Walker, who was more self-conscious than Stroller was and felt harried by a couple holding trays who were hovering over him. ''We could walk up Madison, past Philip Johnson's telephone building, and go to I.B.M., at 57th Street.''\n''I appreciate Johnson's return to the skyscraper top of our youth,'' said Stroller, ''but I've spent so much time figuring out the cheapest rates to call my son in Perth Amboy that I don't want to look at anything that has to do with telephones. Let's sit a bit. I'm beat. I.B.M. is something else, though, isn't it? It is like a big glass house, an outside feeling, like a real park, completely indoors, with those tall trees and outside-type stone floors. I like the way they have mixed chairs and tables with bench-type seats. And I enjoy going to the I.B.M. Gallery of Science and Art, just downstairs, which right now has an absolutely fantastic show about Tokyo and design in the course of history. One of the best things they've mounted, really, with modern technology, a street decorated with shop signs that you can walk through, an electronic montage of Japanese television commercials and a Buddhist contemplation chamber. Also all for free. As you can see, I've been there recently and I don't feel up to it right now.''\n''Oh, I don't really mind,'' said Walker, as the hovering couple made off to just-vacated chairs. ''Besides, as much as I'm a fan of I.B.M., I don't find the adjoining Trump Tower restful; spectacular, yes, restful, no. Nor is the little strip of Bonwit Teller that connects the two. Once you have admired the reddish stone and the dramatic stairwell of Trump, there is no place to put yourself down without having to answer to a menu. And one mills through throngs going up on the escalators, gapes at store windows, and then mills down again. Quite striking the first time, and the next few times, too, but after that what do you do with it? It is a passageway, not an end unto itself.''\n''Well, I would love to hear you expatiate on the theory of the atrium as inner dead-end street as against the hotel lobby as oasis of true elegance, but I've got to run uptown to meet a friend at Lincoln Center, where there is a free one-act opera at the Performing Arts Library,'' said Stroller. ''It's an odd thing with Lincoln Center. Big place, impressive interiors, great in the good weather but no place except the library to sit around in the bad.''\n''Libraries constitute fine stop offs,'' commented Walker. ''I do appreciate the Donnell, opposite the Museum of Modern Art on 53d Street, or even your ordinary run-of-the-mill library. Not only available seating but something at hand for reading thrown in. The Lincoln Center Library is exceptional because you can actually listen to the music of your choice through headphones, or if that is busy, enjoy the children's section on the mezzanine, with its charming displays, not to mention the exhibitions in the Astor Gallery upstairs.''\n''Yes, but my friend is allergic to literature and so we're meeting at 1 Harkness Plaza, on Broadway between 62d and 63d Streets,'' replied Stroller. It's a big walk-through area, with low-backed red half-moon seats. A bit bare, but a good place to meet and sometimes an arena for itinerant performing groups. My friend's a music lover and will browse through Schirmer's, a store full of scores, until I show up.''\n''You are incorrigibly plebeian, my friend,'' said Walker. ''As for me, I shall work my way westward to 44th Street, just east of Sixth Avenue - in municipal Newspeak, that's Avenue of the Americas - and I shall finish my day with a nightcap at the Algonquin.''\n''You will actually buy a drink?'' asked Stroller, incredulously.\n''Don't be silly. I am talking metaphorically,'' Walker answered vigorously. ''My nightcap involves imbibing the aura of New York's most prestigious literary lobby, the lobby whose carpeting nap bent to the tread of the wondrous wits en route to what became known as the Round Table at the Algonquin, a continual seminar conducted by such as Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker and others famed for the rapierlike riposte.''
246	ART: CHINESE WORKS FROM PRIVATE COLLECTIONS	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DF173EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THE China Institute in America is an exhibition space known for ''sleepers.'' In its tiny, scholarly China House Gallery, it has organized solid, low-keyed, informative exhibitions that never make spectacles of themselves and never insist upon broad critical and public attention. Robert Bergman, the director of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, captured something of the spirit of the place when he wrote that the ''China House Gallery must be the smallest exhibition space known to man in which shows of true significance are presented.\nTHE China Institute in America is an exhibition space known for ''sleepers.'' In its tiny, scholarly China House Gallery, it has organized solid, low-keyed, informative exhibitions that never make spectacles of themselves and never insist upon broad critical and public attention. Robert Bergman, the director of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, captured something of the spirit of the place when he wrote that the ''China House Gallery must be the smallest exhibition space known to man in which shows of true significance are presented.''\n''Selections of Chinese Art From Private Collections'' is a fitting commemoration of the China House Gallery's 20th anniversary. In 1966 the gallery opened with ''Selections of Chinese Art From Private Collections in the Metropolitan Area.'' The current show contains 41 works from Northeast states. Together the ornaments, pots, plates, sculptures and paintings, spanning more than 4,000 years, demonstrate the strength of the collections of Chinese art in and around New York. They also help define the qualities that have sustained Chinese art for centuries.\nThe degree of sculptural imagination in a culture can be measured more accurately by everyday objects than by grandiose projects for which the most accomplished artists are expected to produce something great. One of the prehistoric pots in the show seems to be swelling or breathing, as if it were a repository or resting place of the wind. One clue to its power is the tension between the handles, which are turned down, and the main body of the pot, which not only expands but also rises. Another is that the three rows of circles painted on the top half of the pot are both held down by the handles and climbing toward the neck and circular mouth. The content suits the form. With a ripeness worthy of a fertility goddess, the pot inspires confidence in its capacity to provide and contain.\nFew cultures have been more at ease with both geometry and ornamentation. The bronze bell from around the fifth century B.C. is encrusted with hooks and commas and studded with small conical protrusions that resemble breasts in a sculpture by Louise Bourgeois. The patterning both activates the surface and reinforces its cylindrical shape. The result is, in effect, a dialogue between two kinds of time, one immediate and locked into the present, the other continuous and eternal - a dialogue that suits the insistent yet changeless clang of the bell itself. This dialogue is maintained throughout Chinese art, and it is almost always eternity that has the upper hand.\nThe sense that the present belongs to a continuum may be one reason why there is such patience in these works. Part of what attracts Westerners to Chinese art is the impression that no matter how impulsive and gestural, it never seems hurried. In the eighth-century earthenware ''Standing Lady,'' the curve of the drapery, the position of the hands, the rounded, almost puffy face and the strange bun that seems to be gripping the woman's head like an extraterrestrial hand, appear to have emerged almost organically. Throughout early Chinese pottery and sculpture, objects do not seem so much to have been created as to have created themselves.\nOne key to the difference between Chinese and Western art is the approach to line. In Western art the straight line has probably been more important than the curve; at the very least, there has been a heated and often fertile struggle between the two. The straight line is more declarative and linear; that is to say, it tends to imply movement that begins somewhere and ends someplace else. Chinese art has been an art of the curve. With the curved line, there is always movement, but it is movement that invariably turns back upon itself, returning to the same point. While the straight line goes hand-in-hand with progress and change, the curved line is the script of cycles and repetition.\nChinese art has an uncanny ability to accommodate within the curve the kind of experience that is not normally identified with it. That a curved line can be light and sensual is not surprising. But the dragons floating about the superb, voluptuous 18th-century plum vases are also menacing. And in the marble eighth-century lion, clawing and crunching its feline victim, the kind of curve that is so refined and courtly in the ''Standing Lady'' is a mark of ferocity. The West may identify the curved line primarily with softness and gentleness, but in China it has been able to accommodate cruelty, immobility and just about everything else.\nThe China Institute in America is at 125 East 65th Street. The exhibition, selected by the scholars James C. Y. Watt and Annette L. Juliano, closes Sunday. Also of interest this week: Mother and Child in African Sculpture (African-American Institute, First Avenue and 47th Street): ''Mother and Child in African Sculpture'' contains around 50 works, some tiny, almost all of them from the 19th and 20th centuries. The importance of the theme is clear from the ceremonial function of many of the objects: staffs, headdresses, divination rattles, drums and grave-posts. The strength of the show is its ability to dramatize rituals, conventions and differences that may be lost behind a sculptural facade that can still seem far more uniform than it actually is.\nThe show, financed by the Coca-Cola Foundation, is accompanied by a brochure with a helpful essay by Herbert M. Cole. Most maternity images, he writes, were ''destined for shrines administered by ritual specialists.'' He reveals that there is still limited information on many of the ''poses and positions'' in these works, and that in some African cultures the mother and child theme hardly appears at all. Mr. Cole raises the question of the ''dualistic opposition between nature and culture'' that is ''so characteristic of African thought.'' While discussing the complex role of women in African societies, he also offers an intriguing piece of documentation: ''Informal surveys of African sculpture,'' he writes, ''reveal in fact that female figures substantially outnumber those of males.''\nThere are powerful images in the show. In one ''Seated Mother With Child'' from the Ivory Coast, the child rests on the mother's knee, then reaches for its mother's breast, stretching its body to such a degree that it seems elastic. In a rare and puzzling sculpture of a ''Birth Scene,'' from Cameroon, men hold the arms and feet of a suspended woman - almost like figures holding Christ in Raphael's ''Entombment'' - participating in, perhaps even partaking of, the process of birth.\nMost of the women in this show are frontal and impersonal. While a child may occasionally show expression, or climb and crawl over its mother's body as if she were the earth, the mother tends to be expressionless and cool. Sometimes her expression may be fierce, and the breasts that nourish her child may look like missiles or phalluses, which leaves no doubt about her protective and ritual power.\nWithin the relative sameness of the imagery, there are many important distinctions. Some mothers sit, some walk, some kneel as if about to make of their child an offering. The children's two main positions are either lying like a board across the mother's lap or being carried on the mother's back, sometimes surveying the scenery, sometimes staring smack into the mother's spine. But the child may also be nestled into the crook of the mother's elbow; or a mother with twins may hold a child on each knee like ventriloquist's dummies.\nThe analogies and metaphors suggested by the images are invariably pertinent. While the child is generally passive as it is held and suckled, the mother can squeeze her breast as if it were an udder, and the child can lock both hands around the breast as if it were a bottle. In ''Mother and Child Seated on a Stool,'' from the Ivory Coast, the child seems to be not only drinking from the breast but also triumphantly playing it like a trumpet. Hair styles may be wildly different, depending upon the region, and in the ''Mother and Child Seated on a Chair,'' from Ghana, the mother's hair looks like ram's horns. Within her strictly defined changeable role, the African woman that emerges in this show has almost awesome power.\nThe diversity within the apparent sameness is clear from the treatment of the main material, wood. It can look like terra cotta or lava. In the remarkable grave-posts from Madagascar, it suggests limestone or sand. The ''Mother and Child Seated on a Stool'' looks like shiny black marble. The accompanying slide show is a reminder that these wood objects, in their natural setting, would seem part of the natural order. In the ''Kneeling Mother With Child on Back and Carrying a Bowl, Arugba,'' from Nigeria, the way mother and child appear to be perched on a cross-section of a tree makes it seem as if the image has been inside the tree all along. The artist clearly wants us to believe that this representation of a natural process was born of a natural process itself. (Through Feb. 28.)
247	CULTURAL COLLISIONS ON 'ROUTE 1 AND 9'	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DF173EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: IN ''Route 1 and 9,'' the dramatic collage by the experimental theater collective the Wooster Group, blindfolded actors in blackface put up a tin house.\nIN ''Route 1 and 9,'' the dramatic collage by the experimental theater collective the Wooster Group, blindfolded actors in blackface put up a tin house.\nOnce the house is constructed, the gathering turns into a raucous party in which the cast re-enacts a scatological routine by the veteran comic Pigmeat Markham. As the party progresses, a very different sort of drama unfolds on video monitors. Ron Vawter, impersonating the author Clifton Fadiman, delivers a stuffy exegesis on the symbolism of Thornton Wilder's play ''Our Town,'' scenes from which are portrayed soap-opera style, with the actors weeping glycerin tears. The piece culminates with two home movies, one of which portrays a journey away from New York City on the dilapidated New Jersey thoroughfare that gives the piece its title, the other an erotic film of indecipherable couplings.\n''Route 1 and 9,'' which the Wooster Group created in 1981 and is being revived at the Kitchen (512 West 19th Street) through Jan. 18, is the first part of ''The Road to Immortality,'' a retrospective trilogy by the seven-member collective that will continue into the spring at the Performing Garage, the ensemble's regular performing space in SoHo. The second part of the trilogy, ''Just the High Points,'' featuring the group's dark, semi-documentary exploration of the 60's drug culture, paranoia and social persecution, will run from Jan. 22 to Feb. 1. It will be followed in March by the premiere of ''Part Three,'' a collaboration between Elizabeth LeCompte, the Wooster Group's artistic director, and the experimental director Peter Sellars. The new work, initiated by Mr. Sellars, is based on Flaubert's ''Temptation of St. Anthony.''\nThe Wooster Group's retrospective comes at a moment when several in the company have begun gaining recognition outside the collective. Two of the group's longtime members, Spalding Gray and Willem Dafoe, have become national stars. Earlier this season, Mr. Gray performed his autobiographical monologues uptown at Lincoln Center, and he has also appeared in the movies ''The Killing Fields'' and ''True Stories.'' Mr. Dafoe has lent his Mephistophelean magnetism to several movies, most notably ''Streets of Fire,'' ''To Live and Die in L.A.'' and ''Platoon.'' And Mr. Vawter has become an increasingly sought-after television actor.\nWith an artistic point of view that unflinchingly contemplates psychic disintegration, chaos and violence, the Wooster Group represents the darker vision of New York's theatrical avant-garde. Unlike Robert Wilson and Martha Clarke, who explore relativity, irrationality and evil in the context of beautiful eye-pleasing tableaux, the Wooster Group's theatrical collages present the violent inexplicable collision of cultures and artistic materials without prettification or overt moralizing, although the work resonates with a post-countercultural despair.\nBecause of its use of blackface and old-time black vaudeville, ''Route 1 and 9,'' has itself been accused unfairly of racism. Performed with a frenzied, shocking energy, the work is an extreme juxtaposition of ideas of color, culture, community and ways of looking at death. Ways to Tell a Story\n''When I put together a piece, I take ideas either randomly or intuitively and don't impose a thematic structure,'' Ms. LeCompte said recently. ''I've also always been interested in finding ways of telling a story theatrically that are unrelated to Stanislavsky-based acting. Having studied American comedy for years, I came across Pigmeat Markham in the late 70's and started collecting his records. Using only the records, we tried to re-create the routines as closely as possible. I was interested in the way he improvised his routines on the spot. Out of that idea came the notion of the ensemble constructing the piece at the same time that they performed it.\n''During the same period that we were working on the Pigmeat Markham routines,'' Ms. LeCompte continued, ''we were doing readings from 'Our Town.' While working on the play, we got involved with teaching films from the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which we reproduced exactly. Initially I had no thought of putting Pigmeat Markham together with 'Our Town,' but they gradually came together in open rehearsals over many months. Slowly, the images and symbols began to reverberate.''\nMs. LeCompte likened her technique to that of the collage sculptures made of rubbish created by the German Surrealist artist Kurt Schwitters. ''He envisioned a total work of art, which would embrace all the arts in a single unit, but rather than a Wagnerian fusion, it was Dadaist,'' she said. ''Most of it remained in the realm of theory.'' Some of the ingredients assembled in ''Route 1 and 9'' include music by Charles Ives, Shaker processional dances, and rhythm and blues.\nThe Wooster Group was founded by Ms. LeCompte and Mr. Gray in 1975 together with several members of Richard Schechner's Performance Group and in the last 11 years has produced eight major pieces. Out of experiments with structured improvisation, the group evolved its first piece, ''Sakonnet Point,'' an evocation of childhood that became the first part of the trilogy ''Three Pieces in Rhode Island.'' Many of the Wooster Group's pieces interact with well-known American plays. ''Nayatt School'' used a scene from T. S. Eliot's ''Cocktail Party,'' and ''Point Judith,'' the epilogue to the trilogy, quoted from Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' Arthur Miller Objects\nThe Wooster Group ran into trouble two years ago when the playwright Arthur Miller halted performances of ''LSD,'' for unauthorized usage of excerpts from ''The Crucible.'' ''LSD,'' now known as ''Just the High Points,'' is the second part of the current retrospective. Since the brouhaha, Mr. Miller's text has been replaced by an original play, ''The Hearing,'' written by Michael Kirby, and a gibberish language. In constructing one scene in the piece, according to Ms. LeCompte, the performers took a collective LSD trip, videotaped the experience, watched it and reproduced as closely as possible every detail.\nThat kind of uncompromising rigor courts danger, and the Wooster Group has encountered more than its share of hostility and misunderstanding - from critics, authors, and the New York State Council on the Arts, which denied financing for ''Route 1 and 9'' after the charge of racism was raised.\n''We've been critically treated very well in Washington, D.C., in Boston and all over Europe,'' Ms. LeCompte reflected. ''It's funny to come home where we've been treated more equivocally. But I think we thrive on it in some way. I think it's important to do it in this atmosphere.''\nPerformances of ''Route 1 and 9'' are Thursday through Sunday at 8 P.M. at the Kitchen. Shows are at 8 P.M. and tickets are $15. Reservations: 255-5793.

I can highly recommend the smoky and succulent roast pork, which is terrific with a sprinkling of the liquid fire they call hot sauce. The shredded beef is delicious, too. The same pork is served as part of an entree, called pabellon de pernil, flanked by white rice, brassy black beans and sauteed sweet plantains ($8.50). Another good choice is called la hallaca, which is essentially a Venezuelan tamale made with cornmeal-encased bits of pork, beef and chicken steamed in banana leaves ($9). Beer, sangria and Spanish wines are available, unless you are in a political frame of mind and opt for the house Cuba libre (rum, Coke and bitters).\nThe 11 Cafe, 170 Second Avenue, at 11th Street, is open Monday through Saturday from 4 P.M. to midnight; Sunday from noon to midnight. Telephone: 982-4924.\nSpeaking of Latin specialties, a new restaurant on the Upper West Side is turning out some authentically savory snacks called taquitos de lechon asado, which are little soft tortillas filled with roast suckling pig. Las Delicias de Rosa Mexicano, a branch of the highly popular Rosa Mexicano on 58th Street at First Avenue, opened on Broadway at 85th Street last week. It took over the space occupied by an Italian restaurant called Ancora.\nThe snazzy multilevel space has been splendidly redone in earthy tones with vibrantly colored tiles. The informal downstairs grill, surrounding a handsome open hearth where suckling pigs are roasted, serves an array of ''antojitos,'' or Mexican-style tapas. The taquitos come three to a plate with a vinegar-based hot sauce and excellent chunky guacamole; if they weren't so expensive ($12) I could eat them all night instead of having dinner in the more formal upstairs room. Most other snacks are in the $6 to $11 range. The succulent pork has a natural affinity with salt-encrusted margaritas -at least I thought so after two deep ones.\nLas Delicias de Rosa Mexicano is open daily from 5 P.M. to midnight. Telephone: 496-9240.

By Eric Partridge. Revised and updated; edited by Paul Beale. 384 pages. Stein and Day. $24.95.\nWHAT exactly is a catch phrase? In his introduction to the first edition of A Dictionary of Catch Phrases, Eric Partridge wisely refused to let himself be drawn into attempting a hard and fast definition. The most he would settle for was ''a saying that has caught on, and pleases the public,'' which is vague enough - as he intended - to overlap with the cliche, the proverb and the familiar quotation. He also pointed out that many catch phrases ''are not, in the grammarians' sense, phrases at all, but sentences.''\nIn practice, however, most of us can recognize a catch phrase when we meet one, and the best way to indicate the field that Mr. Partridge set out to cover in the dictionary is to quote a few examples.\n''A hard act to follow'' gets an entry. So does ''just what the doctor ordered.'' So do ''all systems go,'' ''famous last words,'' ''we're just good friends.'' So do ''think nothing of it!,'' ''it takes two to tango,'' ''my feet are killing me,'' ''my lips are sealed.''\nSome catch phrases come and go -''now you see them, now you don't'' -but the ones that last are woven deep into the language. Even when they look like cliches, as they frequently do, there is an essential difference: the cliche is a hackneyed idiom that hopes that it can still palm itself off as a fresh response, the catch phrase positively rejoices in being a formula, an accepted gambit, a ready-made reaction. Most catch phrases are meant to provide a comic gloss on the situations they describe; a high proportion of them parody or subvert established slogans and sentiments. At the same time, they constitute an invaluable storehouse of unofficial social history.\nA Dictionary of Catch Phrases complements without seriously duplicating Mr. Partridge's great Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English. It was originally published in 1977; Mr. Partridge was planning a new, enlarged edition when his health failed, and shortly before his death in 1979 he handed over his notes to Paul Beale, who was already at work revising the Dictionary of Slang.\nThe second edition of A Dictionary of Catch Phrases is half as long again as the first. Mr. Beale has revised around a third of the original entries, incorporated some 1,500 new ones based on Mr. Partridge's notes, and added a number of his own. He has also provided an index of key words - an undoubted advantage in a book in which many of the catch phrases are listed under nondescript introductory prepositions and pronouns. Where previously, for example, ''you some kind of a nut?'' only appeared under ''you,'' you can now look it up under ''nut'' as well.\nLike all good dictionary makers, Mr. Partridge saw his first job as defining and explaining, and so does Mr. Beale. One of the more piquant pleasures that the dictionary offers, in fact, is the formal elucidation of phrases that are generally uttered with fine abandon - ''attaboy!,'' for instance (''exclamatory approbation''), or a lilting Australian contribution, ''and did he marry poor blind Nell?'' (''a rhetorical question asked about anything improbable'').\nAnother outstanding feature is the skill with which the editors and the fellow enthusiasts who have assisted them succeed in conveying the precise tone of a catch phrase, and pinpointing the social context in which it applies. Or sometimes the social contexts, in the plural. I like the term invented by one of the correspondents, Cyril Whelan - ''a pen-knife phrase,'' meaning one that ''can be put to a variety of different uses - often apparently contradictory.'' Mr. Whelan was referring to the highly adaptable ''good night, Vienna'' (taken from the title of a romantic operetta), but there are lots of other penknives in Partridge and Beale's collection.\nIt would be useless to deny - and Mr. Beale is the first to admit - that the dictionary is markedly stronger on the British side than the American. Many of the more ephemeral British entries are unlikely to be of much interest to American readers, while the coverage of American catch phrases is distinctly patchy. There is an entry for ''that will do nicely, sir!,'' (from an oft-repeated British television commercial, neatly summed up by Mr. Beale as displaying ''the grovelling acquiescence of an hotelier to the supposed power and status-symbolism of an American Express credit card''), but there is no mention of ''don't leave home without it.''\nThis is not to say, however, that American catch phrases aren't present in force, from ''they went thataway'' to ''the fickle finger of fate,'' or that the entries for them don't contain a great deal of diverting material. Here as elsewhere, one of the great strengths of the dictionary is the variety of sidelights it supplies, and the range of its supporting quotations.\nIt is another sign of Mr. Partridge's largess that he should be willing to cite precedents in terms of ideas (or ploys) as well as actual phrasing. ''There is a very pretty Collection of Prints in the next Room, Madam, will you give me leave to explain them to you?'' - who else would have taken the trouble to track down a remote ancestor of ''come up and see my etchings'' in a comedy published in 1710?\nAnd if he sometimes followed his fancy, and threw in information that wasn't strictly relevant, I am glad to report that Mr. Beale maintains the tradition. It is surely an excellent thing, for example, even if it carries us some distance from catch phrases, to be reminded of the advice to travelers in one of Saki's short stories: ''Never be flippantly rude to elderly strangers in foreign hotels. They always turn out to be the King of Sweden.''

When he assembled his 30-man cast - most of the actors too young to have fought in the war - he had to find a way to help them understand something about the world they were portraying.\nOLIVER STONE, the writer and director of ''Platoon,'' the critically acclaimed film about the day-to-day life and fears of an infantry platoon during the Vietnam War, was a soldier in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968. When he assembled his 30-man cast - most of the actors too young to have fought in the war - he had to find a way to help them understand something about the world they were portraying. He hired a retired Marine captain, Dale Dye, and three Marine reservists, who put the actors through two weeks of rigorous field training on location in the Philippines. The training was difficult and physically demanding, and although it was closer to playing war in summer camp than actually fighting for survival, it did engender some of the exhaustion, strain and comradeship of battle conditions, making a more cohesive and convincing cast.\n''We all had to deal with the task at hand,'' said Willem Dafoe, who plays Sergeant Elias, the officer who is the soul of the unit. ''It was fairly grueling. It's not easy shooting in those conditions in the Philippines. There were no usual Hollywood perks, no honey wagons'' - dressing-room trailers - ''for the actors to relax in, no good food. We sat in foxholes and ate rations and never slept more than two hours at a time. So a real camaraderie developed. The training really helped - though it sounds kind of self-important and self-satisfied to talk about it too much. But it did set the tone of this being important. Oliver had a story to tell and the training was a kind of initiation that made us somehow worthy to tell his story.\n''I'm not saying we really suffered, and I'm not saying we know war, but we did something difficult that helped us get into it,'' Mr. Dafoe said. ''It became very important to all of us to get the respect of Captain Dye and to respect what he had done, regardless of how we felt politically about the war.'' The New Vision Of Carlos Saura The career of the Spanish director Carlos Saura, whose film ''El Amor Brujo'' is playing at the Cinema Studio 1, illustrates a paradox in the relationship between art and political freedom. Mr. Saura, a democrat with strong anti-Fascist convictions, remained in his native Spain throughout the Franco period, managing to produce a body of work that expressed his personal vision as well as, implicitly, his opposition to Franco's politics. Although his country was ruled by a dictator and his films had to pass a censor, Mr. Saura often concerned himself with forbidden themes. One of his most political and controversial films, ''La Prima Angelica,'' managed to pass the censors but aroused a great deal of controversy in its frank examination of Nationalist forces and values during the Spanish Civil War, especially their oppressive influence on one Spanish family. Another film, ''Anna and the Wolves,'' was banned in Spain in the early 1970's.\nFranco has been dead for more than 11 years now, and Spain is governed by a freely elected Socialist Government. The kind of censorship imposed during the Franco era is a thing of the past. Yet Mr. Saura's last three films - all featuring the dancing skills of Spain's foremost flamenco star and choreographer, Antonio Gades - are movies he could easily have made during Franco's regime. ''Blood Wedding,'' the first collaboration between Mr. Gades and Mr. Saura, was a commercial success. ''Carmen'' was one of the highest-grossing Spanish movies ever made and was nominated for an Academy Award, and the latest, ''El Amor Brujo'' (''Love, the Magician''), made at a cost of about $2 million, is one of the most expensive films in Spanish history. Why has Mr. Saura turned away from social and political themes now that he has the freedom to say whatever he wants?\n''In my case,'' said Mr. Saura, ''it's a moral or ethical question. With Franco, I needed to attack a system which I found hateful, within the limits of possibilities under censorship. When Franco died, Spain changed. There is complete freedom, so I am free, too. I feel freer to do things that are more personal.''\nMr. Saura pointed out that his films had never been political in the sense of promoting a manifesto or party. ''The only politics were that they were anti-Franco,'' he said. Life on the Fringe, In Pakula's 'Orphans'\nAlthough the play ''Orphans'' is set in Philadelphia, Alan J. Pakula moved the story's locale to New Jersey for his film version, and used several shots of New York City. ''There are certain New York locations that are just fabulous,'' Mr. Pakula said. ''For example, the first shot is at the new Convention Center - a highly unlikely opening for this picture, but it provides a total contrast to where and how these boys live. The story didn't mandate Philadelphia, it could take place in any major city.''\nMr. Pakula wrapped up the shooting of ''Orphans'' a few months ago. The film, starring Albert Finney and based on Lyle Kessler's play, is tentatively scheduled to open in early fall.\nIt is about two brothers, living together on the margins of society, who have evolved a strangely symbiotic relationship. Treat, the elder (Matthew Modine), obtains money by mugging and picking pockets, and looks after the younger, sickly Phillip (Kevin Anderson). Mr. Finney, re-creating his London stage role, plays Harold, the Chicago businessman whom Treat attempts to hold for ransom and who turns the tables, transforming their shabby lives.\n''The story is really about two young people living on the outskirts of society,'' Mr. Pakula said. ''In New York there is always the sense of wealth and power - the feeling is even in the buildings. Even when you're not directly using that idea, it's there in the background. This story had the quality of a legend. While it's real, it's a heightened reality, and you have to try to use sharpened visual contrasts. For me, no place gives that like New York. The contrast is extreme. It should be like going from the Emerald City to where the boys live on the outskirts of civilization.'' For Disney Films, Time Means Profits ''Lady and the Tramp,'' Disney's classic animated feature about the blossoming of true love between a pampered cocker spaniel and a good-hearted mutt with street-smarts, was back to warm the hearts of a new generation of children this Christmas. The film, which Disney distributors estimated would gross about $36 million to $37 million this time, has made over $13 million so far.\nDisney films, like good wine, have a way of increasing in value with time. When the film first opened in 1955, it grossed about $9 million, according to Richard Cook, senior vice president for domestic distribution at Disney. When it was brought out again in 1962, it took a slight dip, grossing between $6 million and $7 million. But in 1971, the film made $10 million, and when it was re-released in 1980, it grossed $27 million. ''Even allowing for inflation,'' Mr. Cook said, ''the increase is appreciable.''\nThe pattern seems to hold true for most Disney animated films. Their commercial value is not measured in the first-run grosses, but in their increasing profit margin over the years.\n''One Hundred and One Dalmatians'' first opened in March 1961, grossing $14 million. It has had three releases since then, each one better than the last. In 1969, it earned its company $15 million; in 1979, $19 million, and in 1985 it brought in a whopping $32 million. Considering that the Disney classics require no huge expenses to keep them going, the films certainly seem to be paying their own way.\nOne of the most dramatic cases is ''Pinocchio,'' Mr. Cook said. ''It was first released in 1940, when it grossed about $4 million to $5 million. Of course admission then was probably about 25 cents. In 1978, it grossed $15 million and in 1984, $26 million. It was out in video but after Christmas we stopped it. As we release new movies for video, we will call back others. We'll continue to re-evaluate things to see what is better for us to do commercially.''\nDisney releases about three animated features a year. At Easter it will bring back ''The Aristocats,'' and next Christmas - along with a new animated version of ''Oliver Twist'' - ''Cinderella'' will once again go to the ball and marry the handsome prince.

Michael's Pub's ''All Hart'' series of concerts paying tribute to the lyric genius of Lorenz Hart closes this weekend with guest appearances tonight by Marti Stevens and tomorrow by Margaret Whiting. Each will be joined by the jazz singer Mark Murphy and the series host, Jonathan Schwartz. Ms. Stevens, a husky-voiced 50's supper-club singer who went on to star in ''High Spirits'' and ''Company'' in London, is appearing for the first time in years on a New York cabaret stage tonight. The following evening, Ms. Whiting, an indefatigably forthright and warm vocalist, will apply her big, burnished voice to a medley from ''Pal Joey.'' Shows both nights are at 9 and 11, and there is a $10 cover charge and a two-drink minimum per person.\nJohn Hammond Jr., the Speak Easy, 107 Macdougal Street (598-9670). The country-blues singer-guitarist interprets classic blues songs by Robert Johnson, Elmore James and others with a scrupulous reverence and knowledge of the past. If John Hammond Jr. totally subsumes his own musical personality to the material, he is also never less than respectful of the tradition. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 and 11 and tickets are $6.\nFlo and Eddie, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street (228-6300). Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, who call themselves Flo and Eddie as a duo, were founding members of the 60's pop group the Turtles, and are rock-and-roll humorists in the manner of Frank Zappa. Although their musical pranks don't go to the scabrous extremes that Mr. Zappa's do, their parodies and deflations of rock-and-roll icons have enough bite and precision to elicit smiles of satisfaction. By spicing their irreverent observations with straight versions of old Turtles hits, these shrewd pop veterans maintain an off-kilter sense of fun. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 and 11:30 and seats are $12.
252	WINTER STILL STEEPED IN THE BLUES	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D6143EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: JOHNNY WINTER, the rocking blues guitarist who is performing at the Ritz tomorrow night, has been playing the blues, and making a living at it, since he was 14 years old. It hasn't always been easy. When he was a teen-ager, playing around his hometown, Beaumont, Tex., with a band called Johnny and the Jammers, the audiences demanded rock-and-roll.\nJOHNNY WINTER, the rocking blues guitarist who is performing at the Ritz tomorrow night, has been playing the blues, and making a living at it, since he was 14 years old. It hasn't always been easy. When he was a teen-ager, playing around his hometown, Beaumont, Tex., with a band called Johnny and the Jammers, the audiences demanded rock-and-roll. Then he played Top 40 hits and soul music on the Southern bar circuit. Upon being discovered by Columbia Records in 1968 and signed to a lucrative contract, he was urged to play the role of guitar hero, America's answer to the British blues-rock guitar invasion led by Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck.\nSomehow, the blues always won out in the end. ''There's always been an audience that wants to hear the blues,'' the rail-thin, 42-year-old guitarist said the other day. ''But for years, the record company and other music-business people kept wanting me to change, to play like whatever rock groups were real popular at the time. But I have no desire to 'modernize' myself. Very few people are playing the kind of music I play, so I figure I should keep doing it. You always keep learning; you can learn something from almost anybody. But you don't want to just ignore everything you've been doing for years to try something new you don't even understand, just to sound like whatever's happening on the radio.''\nMr. Winter's career has had its ups and downs. He had been a professional musician for a decade when the rock world suddenly discovered him in 1968, but he wasn't entirely prepared to go from local bar jobs to national and international rock tours virtually overnight. ''It seems like as soon as I went from the bars to recording for CBS, I went from being a blues player right into being a rock-and-roller, without ever intending to,'' he recalled. ''Don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing rock-and-roll music, up to a point. But when I'm not playing and listening to a lot of blues, it seems like there's just a big hole in my life. I don't think the manager I used to have ever understood why, if I could play rock-and-roll and make a lot more money, I still wanted to play blues. It didn't make any sense to him. But it's real simple to me. Blues makes me feel good.'' Playing Outsider's Music\nBlues is traditionally an outsider's music, even within the black culture that nurtured it. When Johnny Winter was in his early teens, few white musicians were devoting themselves to it. His early blues performances in Texas drew puzzled or hostile reactions from white bar crowds. Mr. Winter, who is an albino, said he often felt more welcome in black clubs. He spent a lot of time hanging out with a black blues guitarist, Clarence Garlow, whose recordings from the late 1940's now sound like precursors of later blues-rock, with their driving uptempo shuffle rhythms and declamatory guitar breaks.\n''Before the CBS deal came through, I worked in a bar in Houston for a couple of years, playing soul music,'' Mr. Winter said. ''We'd do a soul hit like 'In the Midnight Hour' and people loved it. But then we'd do some hard Delta blues, like 'Rolling and Tumbling,' and even if it was Saturday night, the place would just empty out. Finally, I met a bass player, Tommy Shannon, and a drummer, John Turner, who said, 'Let's just play blues, the way we want to play it, and stick with it until it works out.' Nobody had said that to me before. We love each other, those two guys and me. They helped me out so much, I don't think I'd ever have made it if it hadn't been for them.''\nLess than a year later, fame and fortune beckoned. But the tightly knit trio was in for a shock. The kind of loose, interactive playing that was dynamic in a Southern roadhouse on a Saturday night somehow sounded diffuse, even aimless, in an arena rock concert. ''Those two guys always got put down so bad,'' said Mr. Winter. ''The writers would say they liked me, but the bass and drums were terrible. It got to the point that you just didn't want to go out and play for people, and finally it broke the band up.'' On his new album, ''Third Degree'' (Alligator), Mr. Winter and his original trio got back together to record two tunes. ''It was great to finally feel somebody caring,'' he said.\nMr. Winter was a major rock star of the late 60's and early 70's, selling millions of albums for CBS. But when blues-based guitar solos went out of fashion with rock audiences, Mr. Winter's record sales gradually began to slip. His manager and record label suggested a new style and a new image. Mr. Winter was recalcitrant. He was encouraged by the audiences for his concerts, which remained large and enthusiastic. ''The audience has always been there,'' he maintained. ''But the music-business people just didn't seem to have the slightest grasp of who was listening, or how to reach them. And I admit, they had me kinda scared. They were telling me that if I didn't change, nobody was going to want to hear me again. It is scary if you begin to think nobody knows what you've done and still can do, and that nobody cares.'' Hope From a New Label\nDuring the past few years, the story has taken some ironic twists and turns. In the late 1970's, Mr. Winter had a lifelong dream come true. He was able to produce the last albums by the great bluesman Muddy Waters, and those albums won the Mississippi Delta guitarist the biggest record sales and widest audience of his entire career. But at the same time, Mr. Winter's own career continued to slip. In 1981, Johnny Winter and CBS came to a parting of the ways. And after thinking things through, Mr. Winter resurfaced on Alligator Records, an independent, Chicago-based label solidly committed to the-blues-and-nothing-but.\nThe Texan's three albums for Alligator - ''Guitar Slinger'' (1984), ''Serious Business'' (1985), and the brand-new ''Third Degree'' - have brought Mr. Winter more attention, and better sales, than any of his later CBS releases. While this was going on, another white blues guitarist from Texas, Stevie Ray Vaughan, surprised the record industry by becoming phenomenally successful and was snatched up by - irony of ironies -CBS. The company then signed the Fabulous Thunderbirds, another Texas blues band that features Stevie Ray Vaughan's brother Jimmy on guitar. These artists, playing just the sort of music Mr. Winter was urged to abandon, are among the company's best-selling artists.\n''I'd rather be with somebody who has faith in me and is going to stick it out,'' Mr. Winter said. ''Alligator's been great. I always knew you're bound to have some bad times along with the good times. I always had faith in my music over the long haul; lean times never really scared me. The blues will teach you all you need to know about that.''\nMr. Winter will perform at the Ritz, 119 East 11th Street, tomorrow at 11 P.M. Tickets are $12.50 in advance and $13.50 at the door.

He had tried his hand at commercials, landed a part on a television soap opera and even scored a role in a television movie of the week.\nRAY LIOTTA had been knocking on doors for eight years. He had tried his hand at commercials, landed a part on a television soap opera and even scored a role in a television movie of the week.\nBut Mr. Liotta, who grew up in Newark and had moved to Los Angeles to break into the movies, was tired of having his sights set on feature films and repeatedly hearing the word ''no.''\nThat long-awaited ''yes'' finally came loud and clear last year when Jonathan Demme, the director, cast Mr. Liotta in his movie ''Something Wild.''\nIn that film, for which Mr. Liotta has received critical praise, he plays the part of a menacing ex-convict just released from jail who finds that his wife (Melanie Griffith) has taken up with another man (Jeff Daniels).\nClad in a tight-fitting black T-shirt and with a tattoo on his arm, Mr. Liotta as the character Ray Sinclair obsessively pursues the woman and kicks through a wall, throws Ms. Griffith into a swimming pool, breaks down a glass door, handcuffs Mr. Daniels to a kitchen sink and threatens them both with a knife.\nHow he landed this part, Mr. Liotta said, is a testament to his unswerving determination to make it as an actor as well as his conviction he was right for the part. 'I Knew I Wanted It'\n''I like that kind of intensity,'' said the 32-year-old Mr. Liotta, who was drawn to acting in high school after giving up basketball. ''I like someone obsessed with doing something they think is right. I could relate with loving someone that much and wanting her back. As soon as I read the script. I knew I wanted it.'' It was late last fall that Mr. Liotta, who had played Joey Perrini in the television soap opera ''Another World,'' heard through some friends about a new script that was being circulated around Hollywood that was going to be directed by Mr. Demme. Admittedly far more instinctual than academic about his passion for acting, Mr. Liotta said he had heard of Mr. Demme but was not certain he had ever seen any of his films. The actor said when he read the script, he simply believed he was right for the role.\n''I've played characters like this,'' said Mr. Liotta, a University of Miami graduate who considered going into the clothing business before committing himself to acting. ''Who can't relate to this?'' Dozens of Phone Calls\nMr. Liotta found out who was casting the film, went for a tryout, and was initially turned down.\nBut he said he felt so strongly about the part that he called Ms. Griffith, who was once married to a friend of his from college. It took dozens of calls before he reached her but once he did, Ms. Griffith in turn called Mr. Demme.\n''By then I had done my work,'' Mr. Liotta recalled. ''Anything he had picked out I was ready to do.''\nMr. Liotta was called in by Mr. Demme on a Wednesday. Then Mr. Demme had him return on a Friday to read with Mr. Daniels.\nThe rapport, Mr. Liotta said, was instant.\n''Still I had no idea what was going on,'' Mr. Liotta said. ''It was Super Bowl Sunday and Jonathan asked me to meet him for brunch. I don't think I dressed so quick in my life.'' NEW FACES: RAY LIOTTA
255	HIPPIE FOES OF THE DRAFT HANDLED WITH KID GLOVES	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DB153EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: As they waited outside a local court where their confederates were on trial for taking part in an illegal demonstration, the members and supporters of Freedom and Peace, Poland's draft resistance movement, presented a picture of protest that stylistically, at least, seemed closer to 1960's American hippies and yippies than to the banned Solidarity movement.\nAs they waited outside a local court where their confederates were on trial for taking part in an illegal demonstration, the members and supporters of Freedom and Peace, Poland's draft resistance movement, presented a picture of protest that stylistically, at least, seemed closer to 1960's American hippies and yippies than to the banned Solidarity movement.\nThe young men, all in their 20's, included some with long hair and some with single earrings. One wore one red sneaker and one blue one, and another was dressed in tails, a rhinestone on his satin lapel.\nWith them were women who hugged them and joked openly about police efforts to keep them from the courtroom, where 22 detained members of the organization were being charged with staging a sidewalk protest urging the release from prison of two members who refused military service. The men were released a few days after the protest.\nAngry stares of young police officers at the courthouse seemed like flashbacks to construction workers in New York heaping abuse upon antiwar protesters of the Vietnam era. 'A Personal Thing'\n''Yes, I felt the police hatred was a personal thing,'' said Jacek Czaputowicz a short time after the court aquitted half the demonstrators and fined the rest. An economist, 32 years old and unemployed, he is one of the leaders of Freedom and Peace group.\n''It was not just professional disdain,'' he said. ''It is personal, passionate hatred. I think it is because we are spontaneous and that, among other things, we are ridiculing the military myth so powerful in this country while they are so neat.''\n''But, there was also something else,'' he went on. ''It was clear that the police were under orders from the top to handle us like eggs - no hitting, no rough stuff - and that must have infuriated them.''\nIn November, 51 supporters of the group, including 2 West German antiwar activists, were detained for several hours by the police near the town of Tarnow as they prepared to place a wreath on the grave of Otton Szimek, a German soldier executed by the Nazis for refusing to kill civilians. ''We were kept from the grave,'' said one of the group. ''But here, too, the police officials who questioned us acted as if they had gloves on.'' 'Respected Our Views'\n''They said they respected our views and our goals but that they were only concerned that our wreathlaying ceremony might be exploited by those German revanchists who yearn for the formerly German parts of Poland.''\nWhy exactly should this still small group of antiwar. political oppositionists and ecologically concerned young people be accorded deferential treatment is a source of wonder and debate within the wider opposition where Freedom and Peace has allies and supporters. After all, some of the older opposition had told the young Freedom and Peace people they seemed particularly vulnerable.\nThough small in membership the group is the most cohesive organization to have arisen since Solidarity, reflecting ideas and tactics of a generation swept up by hopes unleashed in Solidarity's bloom while its members were still in school.\nIt was mostly made up of students lacking the protective validity of prominent workers such as Solidarity still enjoys. Moreover, by stressing draft resistance, the group's members were aware that they might arouse disapproval among pious Catholics and Government critics who still widely regard military service as a patriotic obligation. Remarkable Victories\nAnd yet, despite the warnings from their older mentors, the group has not only thrived and expanded, but has won remarkable victories.\n''With our hunger strikes, demonstrations and petitions, we have won the release of people from prison who refused to take the oath of military service and more recently we pressured the Government to extend the amnesty for political prisoners to embrace people who went to prison rather than report for army service,'' Mr. Czaputowicz said. The group is eclectic in its goals and amorphous in its membership, including conscientious objectors, pacifists and even some quite militant anti-Communists. A minority is concerned with ecological issues, pushing for plans to have draft resisters allowed to clean up the environment. Links With Western Groups\nPamphlets and leaflets are prepared secretly and members have established links with antiwar groups in Western countries while developing less close contacts with men and women interested in independent social action in the Eastern bloc.\nPerhaps the group's most extensive campaign was its support of those young men who were prepared to go to the army but not to swear, as all new soldiers must, that they will uphold the interests of Poland's military allies, which is understood as an act of fealty to the Soviet Union.\nFreedom and Peace has suggested that some army units be set up for those unwilling to swear what it views as subservience to a foreign power. The group has never received any direct response from the Government, but Mr. Czaputowicz maintains there is a continuing process of ''negotiations through protest and fact.''\nAnother demand put forward by Freedom and Peace has called for a system of institutionalized alternate service for those whose world views will not allow them take arms. At present, Poland does permit some young men to work off their army time in community service, but Mr. Czaputowicz said the decision in these cases is made entirely by military authorities and it never includes those in the top health category. Right of Alternate Service\nHe said Freedom and Peace wanted all young men to have the right to perform alternate service outside of the military if they wanted to, by working in hospitals or on squads repairing ecological damage.\nMr. Czaputowicz, a former leader of the independent university student movement of 1980, said Freedom and Peace had about 100 full-time, fully involved campaigners but that there were about 10,000 variously involved supporters associated with chapters in all large Polish cities.\nAmong its members are people with well-known names and well known genealogies. For example, one of the leaders of Freedom and Peace in Cracow is Konstanty Miodowicz, a lecturer at Jagelonian University, whose father, Alfred Miodowicz, is the head of the labor unions set up by the Government to replace the outlawed Solidarity unions. The elder Mr. Miodowicz is also a member of the Communist Party Politburo. Also, Jan Jozef Lipski, an internationally respected historian and opposition patriarch, has lent his name and stature to the Freedom and Peace group.\nThe presence of such people in the ranks is at times offered as explanation for a degree of official tolerance. But Mr. Czaputowicz thinks that what has so far provided his group with the greatest protection has been the support it has gained from those Western, mostly West European, antiwar groups, which have been singled out by Moscow as important factors in Soviet disarmament and European strategies.\nWARSAW JOURNAL

Even then, Mr. Lightsey is not as dramatically exaggerated as Mr. Garner could be.\nHe is, however, brimming with contrasts. He takes ''Lover'' from a gentle but firm whisper and raises it to a merry bit of dancing, churning with gaiety and given added intensity from implied breaks that he throws in on the fly.\nIt is a performance shaped as much by his two colleagues - the guitarist Attila Zoller and the bassist Cecil McBee - as by Mr. Lightsey. Mr. Zoller contributes a dashing single-string solo that impels Mr. Lightsey to a more ebullient level while Mr. McBee emerges from the height of the Zoller-Lightsey collaboration with a stately, beautifully structured solo that is a commanding contrast.\nThe trio is made up of three strong, individual voices, balanced so it moves as an ensemble even when one or the other is soloing. Mr. Lightsey's solos can be complex but so subtle that the complexity does not call attention to itself. A melodic flow and a rhythmic pulse are constantly evident even on a slow ballad, when an undercurrent of double time may appear to pin down a positive beat.

No explanation was given by the official Vietnamese news organizations for the absence of expected Cabinet changes.\nA six-day session of Vietnam's National Assembly ended in Hanoi on Monday without the naming of new Government leaders. No explanation was given by the official Vietnamese news organizations for the absence of expected Cabinet changes.\nA Vietnamese News Agency account of the session said only that the assembly had approved a draft law on marriage and the family, adopted development and budget plans for 1987 - including a call for a 7 percent economic growth rate - and welcomed a Soviet call for a nuclear-free world.\nOn Dec. 17, in the largest shake-up in party history, four prominent Communist leaders resigned or were dropped from the party Politburo during the sixth national Vietnamese Communist Party Congress. It was assumed by scholars and diplomats, as well as by some Vietnamese officials interviewed by journalists, that the former Politburo members would also lose their Government positions when the National Assembly met.\nMost Western journalists have been barred from reporting in Vietnam during the last few months. Resigned at Congress\nThe leaders holding concurrent high party and governmental positions who resigned during the party congress were Pham Van Dong, the country's Chairman of the Council of Ministers, or Prime Minister, and Truong Chinh, the party's General Secretary and Chairman of the State Council, or President of Vietnam. Mr. Chinh was replaced as party General Secretary by Nguyen Van Linh.\nLe Duc Tho, a veteran party leader, also retired Dec. 17, and To Huu, a former deputy Prime Minister, was quietly dropped from the Politburo. Mr. Huu had already lost his Government job in a shake-up last June.\nIn addition, Gen. Van Tien Dong, the country's Defense Minister, lost his Politburo seat during the party congress. Vietnamese exiles say he or members of his family may have been involved in corruption scnadals. He was also associated with the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.\nVietnamese officials say new Government appointments can be made at any time. Some scholars believe they may come when there is less public attention focused on national meetings, or they could be postponed until June 1987, when a new assembly is due to be convened. Speculation Over Divisions\nThere is considerable speculation that continuing divisions in the party are holding up the formation of a new government.\nAccording to the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, the new Politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party, from whom the Government officials are likely to be named, is as follows:\nFull members in order of rank are Nguyen Van Linh, Pham Hung, Vo Chi Cong, Do Muoi, Vo Van Kiet, Le Duc Anh, Nguyen Duc Tam, Nguyen Co Thach, Dong Si Nguyen, Tran Xuan Bach, Nguyen Thanh Binh, Doan Khue and Mai Chi Tho. There is one alternate member, Dao Duy Tung.\nVIETNAM PARLEY ENDS

Hazaiah Williams, founder and director of the 30-year-old San Francisco-based Today's Artists Concerts, a community arts group.\nMr. Williams said he organized the program because ''here was one unique American art form which was running the risk of being lost, and certainly running the risk of being misunderstood as a historical musical form.'' He called the endeavor ''a rare event in musical history because these are actually slave songs; these songs originally came spontaneously from the slave community.'' 'The Need for a Change'\nAnd for any program of spirituals, there is a rich body of work to explore. John Lovell Jr., in his book ''Black Song: The Forge and the Flame - The Story of How the Afro-American Spiritual Was Hammered Out,'' said 6,000 spirituals have been catalogued, from ''After Death Got to Fill an Empty Grave'' to ''Zion's Walls.''\nIn his book, Mr. Lovell described these songs as ''religious and spiritual because they tried, with inspired artistry, to pose the root questions of life, of before life, and of beyond life, and to react to these questions as the aroused human being and the bestirred folk have done since the rosy dawn of literature.'' He said the fundamental theme of spirituals was ''the need for a change in the existing order.''\nSpirituals have certainly been heard in concert halls before. But while many concert singers occasionally include them in their recitals, most emphasize the classical European facet of their repertory rather than indigenous American music.\nMr. Warfield, however, can always be counted on to present a greater number of spirituals than most classical singers.\n''Unfortunately,'' Mr. Warfield said recently, ''the spiritual went through a period of time, even with black artists, when they did not particularly use it. I have myself done solo recitals which have had to do with the spiritual. I think I'm one of the few who consistently always program the Negro spiritual as a part of my program. Even in my debut, I combined spirituals with 13th-century songs in Latin, almost in a modal tone, and interspersed spirituals with religious pieces dating back to the 13th century.'' Music and Literature Merge\nMr. Williams, who said the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a classmate at Boston University, has offered this program to commemorate the slain civil-rights leader's birthday, which is Jan. 15.\nAccompanying the singers will be the pianists William Duncan Allen and Eugene Gash. Denis Harper, the oboist, will also perform.\nThe spirituals to be heard are by Roland Hayes, Hall Johnson, Harry T. Burleigh, William Dawson and Edward Boatner. Mr. Williams said these men, ''conservatory- and university-trained, made a major contribution by trying to capture the idiom, putting it in indigenous compositional form, which made it possible to transmit to coming generations.\n''The beauty is that they were aware that in these songs that there was a strange merger of music and literature, wedded like the great art songs.''\nTickets for tomorrow night's recital, which starts at 8 P.M., are $5 to $12. They may be purchased at the Carnegie Hall box office. Information: 247-7800.

But a party before a show? John Reed, the renowned English actor who plays Bunthorne in the parody of Pre-Raphaelite litterateurs and poseurs called ''Patience,'' seemed unconcerned.\nMr. Reed reminisced about his 28 years with the D'Oyly Carte company in Britain and ruminated on rumors of the troupe's rebirth. ''I don't miss it,'' he said. ''There was a time for it, and that time isn't anymore.''\nJust as Mr. Reed was leaving the party at Hanratty's on Amsterdam Avenue for a brief respite before his performance, Jean Stapleton arrived an hour before her own Broadway curtain in ''Arsenic and Old Lace.'' Miss Stapleton made her G & S debut with Mr. Reed several years ago. Is there a new career waiting for Miss Stapleton? She said, ''I'd love to do Lady Jane in 'Patience,' who's always bemoaning how she's aging.'' THE Park Avenue Synagogue was abuzz the other night with the 53d Hanukkah party for hundreds of staff members, clients and friends of the Federation Employment and Guidance Service, the huge nonprofit agency that provides services to 70,000 New Yorkers.\nAfter Caroline K. Simon, a former state judge who is chairman of the federation's board, welcomed guests and children lighted a menorah, awards were presented to five employees, including Rakhil Cherfas, a Soviet emigre and a former client of the agency. Ms. Cherfas was beaming. ''It's wonderful to see Jewish people in yarmulkes celebrating,'' she said. ''We could never celebrate Hanukkah in Russia.''\nBut as the party ended, one thing reminded her son, David, of the Soviet Union - the long line snaking from the synagogue's catering room up the stairs to the coat-check room. ''WHAT more could I want than to be at the Waldorf-Astoria with a lot of pretty girls,'' said Tom Borowiec, an Air Force Academy cadet whose enviable assignment was to escort Princess Mandana Marian Hoveyda. He was one of the 106 military and civilian escorts for the 53 young women from 14 states and 12 countries who were making their debuts at the 32d International Debutante Ball. The ball, a benefit for the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Club and the Leukemia Society of America, was a carefully choreographed evening of good, clean, opulent fun.\nThe debutantes in their white dresses began the evening with hundreds of handshakes. ''It seems like I've been on this receiving line for years,'' Danielle Saladino of Lloyd Harbor, L.I., lamented with a smile.\nThe big moment came as the debutantes were announced, and each, flanked by one uniformed escort from one of the service academies and another in white tie, proceeded onto the great pink stage. For connoisseurs of curtsies, there were various styles, from dainty bows to the fabled Texas deep dips, performed to a chorus of ''yahoos.''\n''It makes me feel like time hasn't passed,'' said Anne Eisenhower, the mother of Adriana Echavarria-Eisenhower, a debutante who is a great-granddaughter of President Eisenhower. Mrs. Eisenhower, who was presented here a generation ago, said, ''Being in this same ballroom brings back lots of memories.'' AS fireworks transformed the night sky into a kaleidoscope, 4,000 runners, many in tuxedos, pink party hats or leotards, and hordes of spectators heralded the New Year in one of the city's most outrageous traditions, the eighth five-mile New Year's Eve race in Central Park.\nFor some runners, such as Doug and Melanie McPhee, this was but an interlude in a night of partying. For others the race was the party. ''Why go someplace and have three drinks when you can run in the park at midnight?'' Albert Moljo said.\nNear the canopy of balloons that marked the finish line at Tavern on the Green, the women's winner, Wendy Sly, said she didn't stop at the ''aid station'' where champagne was served. ''The night's young,'' declared the British Olympic runner.\nThe mood of many runners was summed up by Randy Velzen, who came from Grand Rapids, Mich., with Laurie Curtis: ''It's a real happening, and it's better than any New Year's Eve party.''

The Vatican has indicated it objects principally to the idea that the Cardinal was to hold the meetings in Jerusalem, which it does not recognize as Israel's capital. The Vatican, like almost all countries, does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\nLester Pollack, president of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, said, ''The 'unscheduling' of sessions with high-level Goverment officials in Jeruslaem, after going ahead with meetings with Jordan's King and other officials in Amman, signals a critical setback in the process of advancing understanding between the two faith groups.'' Relationship Called Sound\nOther Catholic and Jewish leaders echoed Mr. Pollack's statement, but preferred to emphasize that the relationship between American Catholics and Jews was a sound one that would survive this setback.\n''Our discussions can't stop and won't stop,'' said Eugene J. Fisher, executive secretary of the Secretariat for Catholic-Jewish Relations at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.\nThe Vatican's refusal to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel or to acknowledge its sovereignty over Jersusalem has been central to the interfaith talks. Other issues broached in Catholic-Jewish exchanges have been abortion, parochial school aid and educational matters, such as the setting up of Holocaust curriculums and joint education programs for seminarians.\nRussell Shaw, a spokesman for the national bishops group, which represents the 300 American prelates, said it was ''sometimes difficult for non-Jews to understand the significance'' of Israel to Jews. By the same token, he said, ''there is a lack of appreciation on the Jewish side for the essentially benevolent policy that the Vatican is trying to play'' in the Middle East.\nMr. Fisher said the O'Connor trip underlined the need for more discussion but he declined to call the incident a setback. ''It certainly is not a step forward,'' he added. A 'Blip' in the Progress\nMorris B. Abram, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, called the O'Connor incident a ''blip'' in what he said has been a growing understanding between Jews and Catholics, particularly in the United States.\nHe noted that last year Catholics and Jews celebrated the 20th anniversary of ''Nostra Aetate,'' the declaration of the Second Vatican Council, which deplored anti-Semitism and marked the beginning of a new openness between Catholics and Jews.\n''We never see progress without a blip,'' Mr. Abram said. ''And this is a blip. What is fundamental is that for the first time in 1,900 years a Pope visited a synagogue. What is fundamental is that the church says that the death of Jesus cannot be blamed on Jews in our times. What is fundamental is that Cardinal O'Connor joins us in New York in demonstrations to free Soviet Jewry.''\nThe Rev. Michael McGarry, the rector of Saint Paul's College in Washington, stressed that it was important that exchanges between American Catholics and Jews should continue because they could ultimately influence Vatican policy on Israel.\n''If there is any chance for change in the Vatican view regarding Israel, it is going to come from the United States,'' said Father McGarry, who recently spent a year at Hebrew University in Jersualem and favors full diplomatic relations between Israel and the Vatican. No Long-Term Effect Seen\nHe said that the case of Cardinal O'Connor, who is generally perceived as a conservative in the church, could be seen as another example of Rome's trying to assert control over American Catholic bishops in the manner that Archbishop Raymond G. Hunthausen of Seattle was disciplined last year for liberal policies.\n''I wonder if the Vatican feels that United States Catholics have been too aggressive in Catholic-Jewish relations,'' Father McGarry said. ''Maybe this would be one more example of them saying, 'Hey, slow down a minute, we have a wider view of this.' ''\nRabbi Alexander M. Schindler, president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, a Reform group that has emphasized discussions with Catholics, said he did not expect the O'Connor trip to have a long-term effect on Catholic-Jewish relations. He said the Jewish organizations were aware that there were ''elements'' in the Catholic world that were unfriendly to Israel. ''I think our good relations are strongest on the American scene,'' he said, adding that the American bishops ''are having their own problems with the Vatican.''\nRabbi Binyamin Walfish, the executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America, an Orthodox group that engages in talks with Catholics on social issues but not on theological matters, said the O'Connor trip was a lesson in the limits of Catholic-Jewish dialogue.\n''We have to be more realistic about our relations with the church and realize that they have theological and religious considerations that supercede their relationship with the Jewish community and Israel,'' he said.\nCardinal O'Connor has explained that he canceled appointments with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel and President Chaim Herzog at the direction of the Vatican. Several leading Catholics and Jews said they were baffled by the sudden change in plans, which came just before the Cardinal left for the Middle East on Saturday. Rabbi's Remarks Noted\nOne theory - given credence in recent days by Mayor Koch and by an article in The Jerusalem Post - was that Vatican officials were concerned about a report in The New York Times on Dec. 22 that quoted Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum on the Cardinal's plans. Rabbi Tanenbaum, the international relations director for the American Jewish Committee, said Cardinal O'Connor hoped to make peace in the Middle East ''a central concern of his ministry.''\nIn a statement Tuesday, Dr. David M. Gordis, executive vice president of the committee, denied charges that the disclosure of the Cardinal's plans touched off the Vatican action. ''The curtailment of Cardinal O'Connor's schedule originated in the Vatican and not in New York,'' Dr. Gordis said.\nWhile some are trying to use Rabbi Tanenbaum's comments as ''a pretext,'' Dr. Gordis said, ''the responsibility for transforming what might have been a contribution to reconciliation and friendship into an embarrassment and humiliation lies squarely with those in the Vatican who for their own reasons have chosen this course.''\nIn another development, Dr. M. T. Mehdi, secretary general of the National Council on Islamic Affairs, praised the Vatican for curtailing Cardinal O'Connor's schedule. ''As American Moslems we are grateful that there is the Vatican which opposes on moral grounds the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem and other Palestinian lands,'' he said.\nDr. Mehdi noted that several leading American Jews had called on Cardinal O'Connor not to go through with his trip if he could not meet with Israeli officials. Dr. Mehdi said that in part he concurred. ''We agree with the Jewish groups that possibly the Cardinal should cancel his visit to Israel. He will then be strengthening his moral opposition to that garrison state.''

265	MUSIC: VICTORIAN SONGS IN CARNEGIE HALL BENEFIT	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DB123EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: TASTEFULLY festooned with antique furniture and other vintage bric-a-brac, the stage of Carnegie Hall was transformed into a roomy Victorian parlor on Wednesday night. The occasion, a New Year's Eve gala benefit for the hall, celebrating the restoration of its late-19th-century physical splendor, brought together classical and pop musicians for an old-time musical soiree of Victorian song and music.\nTASTEFULLY festooned with antique furniture and other vintage bric-a-brac, the stage of Carnegie Hall was transformed into a roomy Victorian parlor on Wednesday night. The occasion, a New Year's Eve gala benefit for the hall, celebrating the restoration of its late-19th-century physical splendor, brought together classical and pop musicians for an old-time musical soiree of Victorian song and music. The concert proceeded with one crucial glitch. Robert Tear, the Welsh tenor who was to have sung a dozen of the 18 songs listed in the program, was ''out of voice'' and unable to perform.\nAlthough the vastly revised program whipped up at the last minute hardly made the seamless period musicale that had originally been planned, its relative success was a testament to the flexibility and professionalism of the participating musicians: the baritone Benjamin Luxon and the pianist Marvin Hamlisch, and cameo guests Isaac Stern (violinist), Yo-Yo Ma (cellist), Richard Stoltzman (clarinetist), Nancy Allen (harpist) and Patricia Zandor (pianist). Mr. Luxon became the hero of the evening, introducing all the music with charming anecdotes and singing several songs in addition to his designated repertory.\nGenerally speaking, Victorian parlor songs that have been passed down over the decades in songbooks are easy-to-sing offshoots of more elevated art song. Many were designed to be performed at informal at-home sing-alongs as well as on the concert stage. Melodies that are often drippingly sentimental carry lyrics that run to extremes of sentiment, fantasy and melodrama. As Mr. Luxon pointed out, wealthy empire-building Victorians reposing in their comfortable well-stuffed salons loved to romanticize faraway places.\nA prime example - and perhaps the loveliest song of the evening - was ''The Kashmiri Love Song'' (1903), Lawrence Hope and Amy Woodeforde-Finden's tale of an Englishwoman, married to a British general in India, who falls in love with the son of an Indian rajah. Mr. Luxon, who has a luscious quivering baritone, approached it with an affectionate warmth, neither hamming it up nor trying to squelch its sentimentality. Accompanied by Mr. Hamlisch, he brought a similar understanding to many well-known Victorian warhorses, including ''The Holy City,'' ''Home Sweet Home,'' and ''Love, Could I Only Tell You.''\nThe nonsingers skillfully filled in the program with instrumental tidbits that ranged from Fritz Kreisler's ''Liebeslied'' (played by Mr. Stern) to Mr. Hamlisch playing Scott Joplin's ''Entertainer.'' The evening's most beautiful single moment was Mr. Stoltzman and Ms. Allen's rendering of Saint-Saens's ''Swan.'' Its funniest was Mr. Stern and Mr. Hamlisch's humorously overblown treatment of ''If I Were a Rich Man,'' from ''Fiddler on the Roof.''

One might think that his chance of hunting down a large saurian in Manhattan would be about equal to the chances of the Australian star of the film, Paul Hogan, in his hometown of Sydney.\nAnother Australian visiting the United States recently discovered a crocodile in a place where one would expect to find an alligator: Miami Beach. South was Pauline Gumby of Sydney, and she and her Australian partner, Peter Fordham, were playing in the 1986 World Mixed Pair Championship.\nThe bidding ended with a hungry match-point double of four diamonds. This was an accurate assessment in a way, because nine tricks seems to be the theoretical limit for each partnership, playing in the appropriate red suit. But South was not without chances in four diamonds.\nSouth ruffed the second heart lead, drew trumps and led a club to the jack. East took the ace and shifted to the spade queen, which was won with the ace. South played clubs and ruffed the fourth round in his hand to reach this ending:\nWhen South led a spade, Miss Gumby opened her jaws wide, played her king and swallowed her partner's jack to defeat the contract and vindicate the double. Obviously East would have been fatally end-played if she had routinely played a low spade so the crocodile coup was essential.\nBut how did she know it was the right moment to look for a crocodile in a place of alligators? Her play would have been fatal if East had begun with a small spade instead of the jack.\nMiss Gumby placed her faith in her partner's expertise. If he had begun with Q-small in spades, he would have returned the small card, not the queen, at the sixth trick.

This weekend, he will offer what is billed as the first United States performances of Friedrich Nietzsche's choral cantata ''Hymn to Life.''\nLukas Foss, that indefatigable exhumer of symphonic rarities, has done it again. This weekend, he will offer what is billed as the first United States performances of Friedrich Nietzsche's choral cantata ''Hymn to Life.''\nYes, the Nietzsche, the late-19th-century German who is best (if inaccurately) known for his philosophy of the Superman. As Lincoln Kirstein argued eloquently in a recent New Yorker article, Nietzsche's brilliant insights were twisted by his sister after his death, creating a false image of bullying bravado that pointed toward Nazism.\nThe real Nietzsche was a philosopher of morals and esthetics. But he also played the piano and composed in his youth, he inspired later composers (Mahler, Strauss, Delius), and his complex relationship with Richard Wagner - first adoration, then fierce polemical opposition - helped set the stage for the post-Romantic reaction and the advent of Modernism.\n''Hymn to Life'' is a seven-minute setting for chorus and orchestra of a poem by Lou Salome, better known by her subsequent married name of Lou Andreas-Salome. This remarkable woman became the romantic ideal of Nietzsche, Rilke, Freud, Strindberg, Hauptmann and Wedekind, who made her the model for his Lulu character, subsequently translated into Louise Brooks's most famous film portrayal and Berg's opera. She was no mere temptress; Nietzsche called her ''by far the most intelligent person I have ever met.'' Romantic Ecstatic Rhetoric\nThe bulk of Nietzsche's compositional efforts were songs and other miniatures in his youth, between 1854 and 1874. He met the young Lou Salome in 1882, and shortly thereafter set her poem ''Hymnus an das Leben'' for chorus and wind ensemble; it was published in 1887 in a symphonic expansion by his friend Peter Gast, which is the version to be heard in Brooklyn.\nThe poem is pure late Romantic ecstatic rhetoric, in which the speaker's self-abnegating commitment to ''life'' is expressed in terms of overheated personal passion. When Gast read the poem, according to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in his book ''Wagner and Nietzsche,'' he assumed Nietzsche himself had written it.\nUnder Wagner's spell, Nietzsche could think of no other music, and his post-Wagnerian revulsion took the form of a clinging to all things light, balanced and Mediterranean, Bizet and ''Carmen'' being his favorites. His early compositions, however, reveal more of Schumann's influence than any other, and Mr. Foss said he feels the ''Hymn to Life'' falls between Schumann and early Wagner in style.\n''My father was a professor of philosophy,'' the conductor (himself a composer) recalled the other day. ''I heard about Nietzsche when I was a child over the breakfast table, and I remember how my father said that in his youth, Nietzsche couldn't decide between being a composer, a poet and a philosopher.\n''Later I learned he had sent an early composition called 'Nirvana' to Wagner, who told him it looked 'delightfully familiar,' which I thought wasn't very kind of Wagner. Maybe that discouraged Nietzsche from composing further. The Nietzsche archives had no record of 'Nirvana,' so we decided on 'Hymn to Life' instead.'' Other Rarities\nThe Nietzsche premiere, and the way it fits in with the rest of this weekend's program, is but another example of Mr. Foss's ingenuity as a program builder.\n''I realize I can't explore a lot of unfamiliar names in a subscription series, or we lose subscribers,'' he said ruefully. ''Subscription audiences want to see the great names. So my problem becomes, how can I still be adventurous and not be repetitive? So I just use my mind to find less familiar things by familiar names.''\nThis weekend's concerts, devoted to the general theme of German Romanticism, contain two other rarities. There will be the first New York performances of Anton Webern's early, Romantic ''Three Orchestral Studies on a Ground,'' which uses material heard in different form in the composer's Passacaglia (Op. 1). There will also be the conductor Felix Mottl's orchestral arrangement of a Beethoven song, ''Die Ehre Gottes aus der Natur.'' The more familiar items on the bill will be Schumann's Piano Concerto, with Bella Davidovich as soloist, and Beethoven's Symphony No. 7.\nThe Grace Choral Society of Brooklyn will sing in the Nietzsche cantata. The three performances of this program are at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 2 P.M. Tickets cost $20, $16 and $10, and are available at the academy box office or through Teletron, 947-5850. Information: (718) 636-4120.

Iraq Retook Four Islands\nAfter 36 hours of virtually incessant bombardment of the Iranians, the Iraqis were able to retake, with relatively light losses, four small islands in the Shatt al Arab waterway that had been briefly occupied by Iran.\nAlthough each side made wildly exaggerated claims about the casualties suffered by the enemy, the consensus among NATO experts is that the total casualties were between 8,000 and 10,000 killed, wounded or missing. More than 65 percent were Iranian, according to one European military official who has monitored the war since it began in 1980. It is estimated that Iran lost 3,000 dead.\n''The political and military leadership in Teheran seems unable to grasp the brutal fact that in war fanaticism and courage are not enough,'' this source said. ''They are attacking today exactly as they did in 1982, throwing thousands of half-trained boys against artillery, mortars and machine guns manned by steady troops. Until they begin to employ more subtle tactics, they will meet with little success.''\nIran's final major offensive, if it comes at all, is now expected in March. Western military analysts favor March, they say, because the ground will be too soft after seasonal rains during February for the rapid movement of Iraqi tanks and artillery. Iraq has numerical superiority in these weapons, the sources said. Iraqi Planes Had Minor Role\nThe Iraqi Air Force, which has established superiority over Persian Gulf and Iranian targets, played only a minor role in repulsing last week's offensive. Many air officers, while acknowledging the damage the air force has done to Iranian refineries and tankers, believe that from the strategic point of view it should shift to new targets.\nThey point out that the Iranians are still able to use the bridges across the Shatt al Arab, which runs from the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to the Gulf. They say these bridges should be bombed because they could be used in a major ground offensive against Basra, which is Iraq's second largest city and the southern terminus of the main highway from Baghdad, the capital.\nThe same is true, air officers said, of the causeways built by the Iranians across the marshes northeast and east of Basra. These could be used by ground troops in any major attack on Basra.\nIf, as maintained, Iran has received a substantial amount of defensive weapons from the United States and Israel, Western experts on the Middle East point out that thus far the weapons have not been used extensively. Iraq's French-built Super-Etendard bombers ranged the Gulf and flew over Iran in December but encountered only two interceptors, American-made F-14's, which were shot down. Nor did they meet surface-to-air missile fire. Electronic Jammers Cited\nOne British official believes that the absence of missile fire is a result of Iraq's deployment of advanced electronic jammers obtained from France. These allow the bombers to penetrate the elaborate Hawk missile defenses that surround Teheran and most of the ports on the Gulf.

The state of Maryland now offers a possible explanation. The National Assessment must not have given credit for neatness and punctuation.\nThat, at least, is how such problems are solved in Maryland. The state adopted its ''functional writing test'' in 1983, with a view to possibly making it a graduation requirement. But the test was roundly criticized because so many students failed, including some who regularly get high grades for writing.\nThe protests led to a study by a special task force, and the state board of education recently approved giving credit for punctuation and neatness, as well as to grammar, logical development of ideas and other substantive criteria.\nPreviously, student writers of ''pretty papers'' got no reward, the chairman of the task force was quoted as saying. ''Now we're saying that if a student can write good sentences that don't say anything, it may not be good writing, but it is competent writing.''\nGiving credit for appearance, as opposed to substance, certainly conveys a message about the way the world works. But is that really the sort of message a state's education system is supposed to teach?

Instead of perpetuating this deception, the Governor could act to end it.\nIn 1986, of the Legislature's 211 members, 184 held leadership titles carrying extra stipends known as ''lulus.'' The term once referred to payments ''in lieu'' of expense money. But today it refers to income supplements that range from $6,500 for the ranking minority members of various committees to $30,000 paid to the Senate Majority Leader and the Assembly Speaker.\nA bill passed during last week's special legislative session and signed by Governor Cuomo adds 11 new leadership posts. That leaves only 16 members lulu-less.\nThe extra stipends were originally intended to recognize a handful of legislative leaders' extraordinary time commitments. They have evolved into a system of backdoor compensation that breeds public cynicism. If the job of a legislator has become more demanding, the proper response is a pay increase, accompanied by strict limits on outside income.\nDefenders of the lulu system contend that it provides leaders flexibility to steer less-talented senior members away from top committee assignments by offering titles carrying handsome stipends but little substantive authority. That amounts to buying off incompetents - an unseemly argument for a public expenditure. The practice also produces a proliferation of lightweight committees.\nGovernor Cuomo could address the issue by appointing an independent salary commission, modeled on the one that recently recommended raises for Federal judges, Cabinet officers and other officials. It could explore the range of issues related to legislators' pay and provide insulation against the criticism that automatically accompanies even justifiable raises for public officials. With such a commission, the next legislative term could see the last of the lulu.

280	Don't Expand Preventive Detention	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DD133EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: At its best, representative government tempers the worst impulses of a democracy.

That's what may be happening now in New Jersey, where a proposal to expand the preventive detention of criminal suspects is wending its way through the Legislature.\nAt its best, representative government tempers the worst impulses of a democracy. At other times, representatives turn those impulses into laws. That's what may be happening now in New Jersey, where a proposal to expand the preventive detention of criminal suspects is wending its way through the Legislature.\nThe proposal has already passed the Republican Assembly and is now in committee in the Democratic Senate. Senate President John F. Russo opposes the measure, but says, quite properly, that he will not prevent the full body from voting on it if it is favorably reported out of committee. Governor Kean proposed the measure in his State of the State message last year.\nNew Jersey already allows preventive detention for defendants in capital cases. The new proposal would ask voters to broaden the practice to all serious criminal cases by amending the State Constitution. The idea, familiar because of debates over similar Federal legislation, is to let judges consider the dangerousness of accused people in making bail decisions. Judges could then deny bail to those they deem are likely to commit crimes. Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick observes that ''statistics show that more than 15 percent of violent crimes are committed by people who are out on bail.'' That means, of course, that 85 percent are committed by others who would be undeterred by preventive detention. It is no small thing that New Jerseyans are asked to trade to keep those 15 percent in jail until they can be tried; it is the basic presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Even then, there are no guarantees.\nThe success of such a system depends entirely on the wisdom, or luck, of individual judges in determining dangerousness. There are no guidelines for such judgments beyond the record of the accused and the best estimate of the judge. Some truly dangerous people might be let loose; some who are neither dangerous nor guilty might be jailed.\nAs of now, it looks like a close call in the Senate, with the forces favoring preventive detention having the advantage. That ought to worry New Jerseyans - at least as much as crime rates do. This is a dangerous proposal; may the state Senate have the courage to reject it.
281	The Year of the Ex-Prisoner	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DD133EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: What a year 1986 turned out to be for the most powerless of God's children, political prisoners. Tyrannies toppled, amnesties multiplied and once-powerful dictators were held to account for their crimes against human rights. There were some deplorable setbacks, especially in South Africa, and progress was uneven.\nWhat a year 1986 turned out to be for the most powerless of God's children, political prisoners. Tyrannies toppled, amnesties multiplied and once-powerful dictators were held to account for their crimes against human rights. There were some deplorable setbacks, especially in South Africa, and progress was uneven. But taken as a whole, it was the year of the ex-prisoner, a time when human rights seemed to come of age globally, conquering offenders left and right, encouraging agitators for decency.\nAn auspicious February saw the non-violent demolition of the Marcos tyranny in the Philippines. Jails were emptied and political rights restored, sending tremors across the Pacific to South Korea, Taiwan and mainland China.\nNearer home, President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier in Haiti was thrown out, and other prison gates were thrown open. And in Guatemala, an elected civilian President took some first steps to end a human rights nightmare. All the new regimes are coping with troubles, but for once the tide is with them.\nBooks by victims mattered in 1986. Armando Valladares's book, ''Against All Hope,'' a graphic account of Cuba's penal colony, was a devastating blow to that Communist regime's reputation. Adam Michnik's ''Letters from Prison'' did the same for the Polish version.\nA defensive Fidel Castro freed scores of long-term political prisoners (no dictatorship holds more than Cuba), and by year's end in Warsaw, the last of jailed Solidarity supporters were released. By contrast, Stalinist Czechoslovakia marched backwards, jailing devotees of jazz.\nUnder Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union joined in freeing its most celebrated captives: Anatoly Shcharansky, Yuri Orlov and Andrei Sakharov. Hundreds more waste in jail, and uncounted thousands are denied the rudimentary right to emigrate. But Mr. Gorbachev will now be judged by hopes he has loosed, especially after personally intervening to end the banishment of Dr. Sakharov and Yelena Bonner, the scientist's formidable wife.\nThe year saw important precedents for holding the powerful accountable for political crimes. In Argentina, a nation sat in judgment on itself just before the year began, trying and sentencing the generals responsible for a ''dirty war'' against terrorists. A parallel drama is underway in the Central African Republic, where the brutal former Emperor Bokassa returned from exile and is being tried for his offenses.\nSuch accountability is usually left to historians, not to courts. Prudence, hypocrisy and ideology conspire to save butchers in uniform or (as in Iran) clerical garb. Justice is a stranger in most of the world, where dictatorial regimes are the rule. And whatever the advances elsewhere, in South Africa a Government that professes Western values progresses toward totalitarianism. The year ends with Dr. Sakharov free but not Nelson Mandela. The task for 1987 is to keep the contagion alive.

But 1987 does offer a few possibilities for interesting action:\nNew years ordinarily are nothing to look forward to, since it doesn't take many of them to convince any observant soul that things usually get worse. But 1987 does offer a few possibilities for interesting action:\nPat Buchanan's Presidential Campaign:\nThe redoubtable White House communications chief has disavowed any thought of seeking the Presidency, but a number of conservative movers and shakers say they're going to put him up anyway. Would that they would, for at least three reasons.\nOne is that Pat Buchanan would enliven any campaign with outrageous views and outrageous remarks, spoken with candor and enthusiasm, however wrong-headedly. Among the usual pussy-footers and hair-splitters of Presidential politics, he would stand out like a fire truck coming down Pennsylvania Avenue with sirens wailing and red lights flashing. What's wrong with that? Second, a Buchanan candidacy would give blunt-headed conservatives, far more than Ronald Reagan ever has done, the unmistakable, black-and-white, uncompromising choice between the hard right and everybody else that these conservatives hunger for. What's wrong with that, everybody else?\nThird, Mr. Buchanan could explain why he insisted in a television debate last March 17 that among those aiding the Sandinistas in Nicaragua were ''Islamic extremists from Iran.'' Was that the same Iran the Reagan-Buchanan Administration was selling arms to at the time? Have those extremists now gone over to the anti-Sandinista contras to whom the arms sales proceeds were diverted? Does the right hand know what the right hand is doing?\nThe Rev. Pat Robertson's Presidential Campaign:\nThe widely known TV evangelist apparently is serious about seeking the Republican nomination. He has a following, lots of money and the potential to take conservative and fundamentalist delegates away from both George Bush, a born-again right-winger, and Jack Kemp, who claims he's an original. Whether Mr. Robertson has the potential to win is another matter.\nBut if both Pats enter the Iowa caucuses and that big Southern primary in March 1988, the right-wing di-lemma could be heart-rending. It could be so rending, in fact, that Bob Dole could wind up running and looking like a moderate - proving once again that in Presidential politics anything is possible.\nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential Campaign:\nThe Chicago spellbinder is already being bombarded with advice not to run again, to throw his support to someone who can win, to conduct himself so as to enhance Party unity - in short, to be a credit to his race rather than pushy and demanding.\nNo doubt that's good advice from people whose main interest is to put a Democrat in the White House - almost any Democrat except Mr. Jackson. But why should he heed that advice? He can hear Democratic leaders calling for their party to move to the right. He can look over the probable Democratic aspirants and see no one who looks like a traditional Democratic liberal - save possibly Mario Cuomo, who is only beginning to act like a Presidential candidate and may not be strong in the South and West anyway.\nBesides, Mr. Jackson is an American; he's got a right to run - at least as much right and probably more, by dues paid, than Mr. Robertson in the other party. Why should Mr. Jackson step aside in the interests of party unity, when George Wallace didn't in 1968 or 1972, or John Anderson or Edward Kennedy in 1980?\nAs for whether he can win, Jesse Jackson certainly can see the opportunity afforded a strong black candidate by that big Southern primary -an opportunity, at a minimum, to win a sizable delegate block that might keep Democrats mindful of the importance of black votes in November 1988 and thereafter.\nSenator Jesse Helms's Second-Thought Campaign:\n''Senator No'' of North Carolina promised that state, when it elected him to a third term in 1984, to keep the chair of the Agriculture Committee rather than shift to the top seat on Foreign Relations, as seniority would have entitled him. Now he says the Republican loss of the Senate negates that pledge; so he's claiming the Foreign Relations post of ''ranking Republican.'' Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, who chaired the committee for the last two years, understandably is resisting.\nI have no head count on this momentous struggle. But if the committee's Republicans allow Mr. Helms to renege on his pledge and get away with it, they'll deserve what they'll surely get. Happy New Year!\nIN THE NATION

New Year's Eve. A few other hospitals had already limited the types of emergency patients they would serve, and others announced curtailments late Wednesday.\nIn addition, seven hospitals said their services would be limited. Most said they could not accept people with head or chest wounds because thoracic and neurological surgeons were not available. 'Not a Crisis'\nBut Lynn Aspinall, a spokesman for the Metro-Dade Fire Department, said: ''There's close to 40 hospitals in Dade County. That does not a crisis make, when a couple of hospitals close their emergency rooms.''\nShe said the affected hospitals handled a fraction of the county's emergency cases.\nOfficials said that the protest was apparently not an organized effort and that the number of hospitals and doctors involved was constantly changing.\nThe doctors are protesting increases of 25 to 40 percent in insurance rates. They also oppose a law that sets new minimum amounts for insurance coverage.\nThe Florida Medical Association estimates neurosurgeons in Dade and Broward counties will pay a record of $143,000 to $176,366 a year for policies that pay a maximum of $1 million for each claim, up to $3 million a year.\nUnder the Malpractice Reform Act that took effect today, Florida's 29,600 licensed doctors must either carry malpractice insurance of $250,000 for those who treat hospital patients and $100,000 for those who do not or must inform patients of their decision to do without.\nUnder the new law, if an uninsured doctor loses a malpractice case and cannot pay the award, the physician could be prevented from practicing for up to five years.\nDade County legislators have scheduled hearings Jan. 12 on the insurance crisis.\nState Representative Art Simon, who recently sponsored malpractice legislation, said the doctors ''seem to feel that if they withhold their services the Legislature will wave a magic wand to solve the problem of rising insurance rates.''\nHe said that doctors had good reason to complain about skyrocketing malpractice insurance rates but added that the answer ''is not to withhold their services from people desperately in need of medical care.''

Then you don't have to feel guilty when they aren't kept. Here are some possibilities:\nPresident Reagan - I will stop dreaming of anything but Nancy and leave visions of a Star Wars perfect missile defense and of moderate mullahs to the script writers for films that I'll never make. Next time I see Mikhail Gorbachev, I will make sure there is a full transcript of our talks.\nAyatollah Khomeini - I will try to buy my weapons from Iraq's President. He is a greater enemy than the U.S. and Israel, and what do I care if he wants to use the profits for guerrillas in the Philippines or to fight drug dealers in Colombia?\nMikhail Gorbachev - Next time I'll insist on going to Palm Springs instead of Iceland, and I won't leave until Mr. Reagan signs on the dotted line. If he refuses, I'll invite him to Chernobyl.\nEugene Hasenfus - I will make sure to carry a calling card of Lieut. Col. Oliver North with me whenever I get in an airplane. That way if anything happens, he will be the hostage and I will be sent straight home.\nColonel North - I will never trust Swiss bankers, and I will never hand out another business card.\nDaniel Ortega Saavedra - If Iran insists on financing the contras against our Sandinstas, I will take Iranian hostages and sell them back to finance the Communists in Iran.\nSecretary of State George Shultz -I will not allow the President to tell me what the White House is doing. It could be embarrassing. Anyway, does Macy's tell its competitors? Government and the State Department don't mix.\nVice President George Bush -Now that I'm no longer the front-runner, maybe I'll just run for Vice President. There are a lot less headaches in this office.\nLee Iacocca - I'll keep saying that I do not choose to run until the budget is out of the red. There's no way Chrysler can bail out the Federal Government, and I've got my reputation to think of.\nDonald Regan - Obviously, the shovel brigade didn't have enough shovels to get the mess out of sight. We'll buy more and more, Gramm-Rudman be damned. If I lose my job, I can always sign on with Barnum & Bailey. I've proven qualifications.\nPresident Francois Mitterrand -How can I get some of Donald Regan's shovels into Jacques Chirac's hands? Or should I make him student leader of the year?\nPremier Jacques Chirac - I won't send Mr. Mitterrand any more decrees. That way he can't upstage me by refusing to sign them. And every time I buy back a hostage, I'll make sure Washington does it first and pays more, so everyone will see that I got a bargain.\nPresident Hafez al-Assad - I'll have nothing more to do with Lebanon until all the factions there make up their minds once and for all which side they're on. Maybe I should send for the Nicaraguan contras to unite everybody else.\nKurt Waldheim - I'll write a new autobiography before I run for president of Austria again.\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher - I'll get a punk hair-do and a mini-skirt and run as the new Maggie. They might not like it in the shires, but it will bring flocks of tourists and do wonders for the pound.\nPresident Botha - I'll abolish the television, the press, the courts and the unions. It's the only way to save freedom and democracy in South Africa. Any American congressmen who voted for sanctions will be welcome to come and stay. We'll make sure they don't vote again.\nPresident Mobutu Sese Seko - As a gesture of good will, I'll offer Washington lessons in how to divert billions, not paltry millions, to Switzerland and keep it out of the press. It's time for Zaire to show its gratitude for aid past.\nPresident Corazon Aquino - I'll go right on the way I'm going, they haven't got me down yet. Imelda Marcos can have all her shoes back if she wants, she and Ferdinand aren't going anywhere any longer.\nGeneral Juan Ponce Enrile - I'll nver join another revolt against a sitting president. It's the running one I have to worry about catching up with.\nDeng Xiaoping - I will make sure that students have plenty of ink and paper for posters. It will keep them off the streets and brighten up city walls. And I will arrange for a lot of Big Mac franchises. Students with their mouths stuffed can't shout.\nAndrei Sakharov - Now that I'm back home and can speak my mind, I'll wish everyone a happy and peaceful New Year.

The crowds surged back and forth along the beaches.\nAn estimated 20,000 people were on the black beach, and the Indian beaches were packed as temperatures in the 80's brought out huge holiday crowds. Swarms of bluebottle flies added to the tension, and 300 people were reported treated for stings. Lifeguards Escorted Out\nOne witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said lifeguards at the black beach locked themselves in their offices to escape attack until they were escorted out by police officers.\nA police helicopter was used to spot trouble on Durban's beaches as about 500 soldiers, city police officers and South African Police, a nationwide group, patrolled the area in armored vehicles and on foot.\nThere were no reports of whites taking part in the fighting.\nMeanwhile, the South African Police said in a statement that at Winklespruit, 18 miles south of Durban, ''an Indian youth was stabbed to death when commuters on board a train became angry when it stopped too long at a signal.'' 'Crowd Stoned Train'\n''The crowd stoned the train, smashing several windows and then rushed through a caravan park where the youth was stabbed,'' said the police statement. ''Several parked vehicles at the railway station were also damaged.''\nThe police statement did not mention the race of the people in the crowd, but witnesses said they were black.\nThe police statement on the Durban disturbance said the police ''were forced to use birdshot to disperse a mob which had repeatedly robbed an ice cream kiosk at a Durban beach.'' Witnesses said the birdshot was fired at Clover Leaf Beach.\nFour robberies or attempted lootings occurred at the kiosk during the day, the statement said. ''Police first used tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowds who then began stoning the police.'' Snack Stands Looted\nOther sources who spoke on condition of anonymity reported at least three snack stands at the black and the Indian beaches were looted during the day and one was demolished.\nPreliminary, unconfirmed reports indicated six to nine people were treated at Addington Hospital, a white facility, and there was a report an Indian woman was stabbed near Clover Leaf.\nAlthough the violence was not connected with unrest under the state of emergency, the police referred calls to the Government's Bureau for Information, which referred them back to the police. Officers refused to give information throughout the day when reached by telephone.\nOne report suggested the trouble began when blacks carrying banners arrived at Sunkist, an Indian beach, but there was no confirmation of that.\nBy law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which South Africa's 24 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.\nEditor's Note:\nSouth African press restrictions now prohibit journalists from transmitting dispatches on any security actions, protests, detentions or ''subversive statements'' without clearance by Government censors.

290	LAW ON EMIGRATION IN EFFECT IN SOVIET	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D7133EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: American officials remain concerned that recent steps by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to liberalize some elements of Soviet society may not touch restrictions on emigration, a major obstacle in relations between the two countries.\nAmerican officials remain concerned that recent steps by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to liberalize some elements of Soviet society may not touch restrictions on emigration, a major obstacle in relations between the two countries.\nEmigration from the Soviet Union in general is heavily restricted, and the State Department estimates that only 30,000 to 40,000 people would be eligible to leave under a new emigration law that took effect today, according to Richard Schifter, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs.\n''I have heard disparaging remarks from Soviet officials about the migration policies of the Brezhnev era, that they were disorganized and 'What did we get for it?' '' Mr. Schifter said.\nHe was alluding to the former Soviet leader, Leonid I. Brezhnev, who, as an exception to the general curbs on emigration, allowed 260,000 Jews to leave from 1969 through 1979. Soviet officials have said that ''they are not going back - no large-scale emigration,'' Mr. Schifter reported. Previous Official Hints Recalled\nLast fall, before the text of the new law became known in the West, there was a hint from a Soviet official that a rise in emigration was possible, Mr. Schifter said in an interview.\n''It was not a clear statement; it was a vague hint,'' he recalled.\nAnother Administration specialist speculated that there could be a onetime surge in emigration under the new law until the reservoir of those eligible was empty.\nThe Soviet Union's continuing barriers on free emigration and foreign travel in general have been a counterpoint to the relaxation that has occurred under Mr. Gorbachev, represented most recently by his ending the exile of Andrei D. Sakharov, the physicist and human rights advocate.\nOther political prisoners have been freed. The Soviet press has been given increased latitude to debate public issues, and there has been some loosening of restrictions on film and theater, including some frank productions about the Stalin era. New Chapter in De-Stalinization\nStephen F. Cohen, a professor of Soviet politics at Princeton, sees this as a second chapter in de-Stalinization, the first of which was written by Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1956 when he denounced Stalin's repressive policies.\n''Gorbachev is trying to rally the intelligentsia that share his values and his views to his side,'' Professor Cohen said. ''I saw with my own eyes people in Moscow. Established reform intelligentsia were just elated.''\nIf no steps are taken by Mr. Gorbachev to relax movement across the Soviet border, the domestic changes may not affect the political dynamics between Washington and Moscow, for the emigration issue occupies an important place among the irritants in Soviet-American relations.\nUnder American law, relaxation of emigration restrictions is a prerequisite for easing trade barriers with the Soviet Union.\nAnd when it comes to the emigration of Jews, no other human rights question has such a well-organized American constituency. U.S. Jewish Groups Active\nGroups such as the National Conference on Soviet Jewry and the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews conduct intensive information and lobbying campaigns with the Administration, Congress, the public and news organizations, and they have threatened to stage demonstrations if Mr. Gorbachev ever visits the United States.\nAmong the exceptions to the curbs on Soviet emigration have been not only Jews, but other minorities such as Armenians and ethnic Germans. The flow of Jews, in particular, reached a peak of more than 51,000 in 1979, but dropped to 914 in 1986, according to the National Conference on Soviet Jewry.\nThe exceptions have usually been allowed on the ground of ''family reunification,'' with Soviet citizens permitted to join relatives abroad, often distant or even fictitious kin. What has made the new law more restrictive is that the definition of family has now been narrowed to close relatives, such as a parent, sibling, child or spouse.\nThe law contains a section barring discrimination on racial, ethnic, religious or other grounds. This has been interpreted abroad as ending the preference given to Jews in the past.\nNow, Mr. Schifter said, the 30,000 to 40,000 people estimated to have close relatives abroad include Jews, Armenians, ethnic Germans, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians and Ukrainians. It is not known how many of them would want to emigrate. Fewer Jews Are Being Held\nIn the midst of Mr. Gorbachev's liberalization, Jewish campaigners in the emigration movement have had mixed experiences, according to Jerry Goodman, executive director of the National Conference. No Jewish activist has been arrested, tried and imprisoned since last summer, Mr. Goodman said, although some have been locked up for 15 days on charges of hooliganism.\nThe number of Jewish campaigners in prison is down to 14, ''the lowest in many years,'' he said. The usual level has been about two dozen. At least four of the prisoners have been beaten, according to information reaching here.\nIn addition, ''There has been a lot of harassment of Jews in the religious sphere,'' Mr. Goodman noted. Those attending study sessions after services in synagogues have been threatened with arrest, he said, as have Hebrew teachers.

293	SENEGAL HAILS VENDOR HOME FROM 5TH AVE.	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DE103EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Up and down the twisting alleys and crowded stalls of Dakar's Sandaga market, Cheikh Ndiaye is known as ''the man who came back from New York.''\nUp and down the twisting alleys and crowded stalls of Dakar's Sandaga market, Cheikh Ndiaye is known as ''the man who came back from New York.''\nResplendent in his gold bracelets, gold-rimmed sunglasses and freshly embroidered tunic, Mr. Ndiaye is treated with respect. He returned home from New York this month after working for two years selling scarves, purses and sunglasses on ''Cinquieme Avenue,'' (''Fifth Avenue.'') ''They always ask about the cold,'' Mr. Ndiaye said of other vendors who eagerly inquire about peddling conditions in New York. ''I say you buy three pairs of socks, two pullovers and a coat, and you'll be O.K.''\nMr. Ndiaye is part of a wave of Senagalese vendors who have spread in recent years, first through West Africa, then to Europe and now to New York. Drought Among the Causes\nIn Dakar, the phenomenon is attributed to a combination of causes: the ending of exit visa requirements for Senegalese citizens in 1981, a severe drought that devastated peanut farmers from 1973 to 1985, and a knack among people of this West African nation for trading.\n''The caravans that used to cross the Sahara with salt are now being reinvented on the jumbo jet,'' said Abdou Rahmane Cisse, information director for the Sengalese Government.\nNew York is an increasingly popular destination. For $600, a Senegalese can fly round trip from here to New York, only slightly more than for the round trip flight to Paris.\n''The number of visa applications has gone right off the scale,'' Betsy L. Anderson, United States Consul here, said. In two years, the number of applicants for nonresident visas has jumped from 300 to 800 a month, she said.\nAbout 75 percent of the applications are denied, the Consul said.\nMr. Cisse, who directs several researchers studying the vendors, said he became intrigued by the phenomenon when he was asked by about 10 passengers on an Air Afrique flight from Dakar to New York to fill out their landing cards. The passengers could speak only Wolof, Senegal's principal language. Day of Shopping in New York\nThe traders told him they planned to spend the day in New York shops, mostly buying electronic goods and cosmetics for black people, and then return to Dakar in the evening.\n''New York has become a commercial suburb of Dakar,'' the information director said. ''You cross the big lake, make your purchases, and then come home the same day.''\nThe second type of vendor, more familiar to New Yorkers, is Dakar's ''bana-bana,'' or street peddler.\nThese vendors, Mr. Cisse said, are often illiterate men from Diourbel, Senegal's peanut farming region. Many are ''mourids,'' followers of a Moslem sect that stresses hard work. Brother Sells Women's Shoes\nAt Sandaga market, Mr. Ndiaye, 36 years old, was found on a recent afternoon minding his brother's stall, which was lined from floor to ceiling with women's shoes. To attract customers, a tape deck blared the electrified Wolof rhythms of a Senegalese pop singer, Youssou Ndour.\nMr. Ndiaye said he was a mourid from a family of peanut growers in Diourbel.\n''I went to New York to have some money,'' the lanky vendor said over a Sprite, a taste acquired during his years in Manhattan. ''With the drought, Senegal wasn't working out.''\nThe solution for Mr. Ndiaye's family was to pool their money and buy him a ticket to New York. Arriving in August 1984, he started selling sunglasses on Fifth Avenue. At night, he shared a room with two other Senegalese vendors in the Bryant Hotel at 54th Street and Broadway for $12 a head a night.\nBy charging a 25 percent markup on the sunglasses, scarves, belts and purses he bought wholesale, he said, he was able to put aside $35 to $45 every month to send home. Four Depended on Him\n''They were very pleased,'' he said of his mother, wife, daughter and younger brother who live in Dakar and depended on his remittances for survival.\nMr. Ndiaye, who hopes to return to New York in January on another family-financed ticket, said other vendors at Sandaga often asked him for tips on New York market conditions.\n''Scarves are good in December, but by January, they all have them,'' he said. ''Tourists are best. Most New Yorkers are used to the merchandise.''\n''The best spots are on Fifth Avenue across from that Saks store and near the big church,'' he recounted.\nMr. Ndiaye, a Moslem, said that in the two years spent working on Fifth Avenue he never ventured into St. Patrick's Cathedral.

One source said the Senator was weighing the formation of an exploratory committee and would make his plans known as early as\nReports are circulating in Washington that Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas will become an active candidate for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination within the next few months. One source said the Senator was weighing the formation of an exploratory committee and would make his plans known as early as March.\nThe Senator's press secretary, D. Matt James, said in response to questions: ''Senator Bumpers has been approached by a number of people about running. He has made absolutely no decision on an exploratory committee at this point. Senator Bumpers has not approached anyone about a candidacy or forming a committee.''\nIn the 1984 Democratic competition, which was ultimately won by Vice President Walter F. Mondale, Mr. Bumpers considered running for several months but announced in April of 1983 that he would not become a candidate. He said he was afraid he would be unable to raise enough money for a credible campaign, particularly in the heavy concentration of early primaries.\nThat concentration will be even heavier in 1988, but it will also include, for the first time, a substantial cluster of Southern primaries. The single cluster of primaries on what politicians call Super Tuesday could on a single day provide a dominant candidate with a quarter of the delegates needed for nomination.\nSenator Bumpers, who is 61 years old, has something of a record of political upsets. In 1970, as a relatively unknown country lawyer with no experience in politics or government, he was elected Governor of Arkansas, defeating two men who had both held that office before. In 1974 he defeated a 30-year veteran, Senator J. W. Fulbright, in the Arkansas Democratic Senate primary and went on to win 85 percent of the general election vote.\nWASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING

That is a lesson that Herbert Ingber says he learned after a six-year stint in Muttontown, L.I., where he and his son-in-law, Ronald Stromfeld, built custom homes priced as high as $1 million.\nIN the building profession, glamour does not always pay off. That is a lesson that Herbert Ingber says he learned after a six-year stint in Muttontown, L.I., where he and his son-in-law, Ronald Stromfeld, built custom homes priced as high as $1 million.\n''What with the decorators, consulting architects and engineers, it would take us over two years from the time we signed the contract to the time we delivered the house,'' Mr. Ingber said.\nNow he has moved back to Queens - where he developed housing for 15 years before going to Nassau County - and he is spot-building mostly low-rise residences on speculation. ''The people here aren't so demanding,'' he said. ''They appreciate what they see and don't care about custom colors.''\nHis current focus is the Corona section, an area in the north of the borough that has not seen much new construction in recent years. Mr. Ingber has owned a real estate company there since 1945, giving him early opportunity to buy vacant or underdeveloped lots as soon as they become available.\nNow under construction are three attached, three-family homes in a boxy building, made of a roughly textured red brick, on Nicolls Avenue near 102d Street. Each house has two three-bedroom apartments and one two-bedroom unit, with 1,100 square feet in each apartment. The houses will have an asking price of $450,000 to $500,000 when they go on sale in March. Ordinarily, Mr. Ingber said, a buyer occupies one apartment and rents out the others for about $1,000 a month each.\nIngber Development bought the 8,500-square-foot tract, which came with a house on the extreme western edge, for $350,000. It then resold the house and a smaller yard for $230,000, keeping the remaining land, which now measures 60 by 100 feet. ''By spinning off the house, we were able to reduce the cost of the three lots,'' he said.\nMr. Ingber started building in Corona in the mid-1960's. But since then property prices have risen tremendously. Mr. Ingber remembers selling a house through his real estate concern, Veterans Realty, for $58,000. He recently bought the same house for $285,000. In addition, his land costs generally run about $150,000. ''Fifteen years ago,'' he said, ''we used to buy plots for $2,500.''\nMr. Ingber and Mr. Stromfeld are also doing a rental building in Corona, at 40-50 Junction Boulevard, a block from Roosevelt Avenue. It will have eight commercial apartments, for use as medical or legal offices, and eight one-bedroom apartments. The commercial units will rent for $2,000 a month, while the residential apartments are expected to command $750.\n''Here, we are more interested in doing something from a design point of view,'' said Leo D. Fakler of Fakler/Eliason Architects & Planners of Queens, who handles Ingber Development's buildings. ''This will have an art-deco facade, and we're going to use a great deal of stucco.'' The building, on a 5,000-square-foot parcel, is scheduled for a fall opening.\nIngber Development is now assembling land on 97th Street near Junction Boulevard. It has bought three one-family houses, to be demolished in April to create six lots for a complex of six attached, three-family homes.\nPart of his success in Corona has to do with the proximity to the Corona Plaza-103d Street subway station, which is within close walking distance of all of his developments there. Barring delays, a ride into Manhattan on the No. 7 train takes about 25 minutes.\nHis Corona endeavors have caused fewer headaches, too. ''In Nassau County, we would have already started buiding the house when an interior decorator would come in and tell us to move the walls around,'' he said. ''In Queens, what they see is what they get.''
296	WHERE TO SAVOR A CROISSANT OR SIP A CAPPUCCINO	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DE103EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: UPPER midtown, with its abundance of shops and art galleries, is an ever-changing terrain for a stroll-and-stop type of peregrination. Yet, there may be moments when a walker feels unable to go one more block without some nourishment. Not a full-fledged meal, but merely a warm drink or a light snack to refuel the spirits.\nUPPER midtown, with its abundance of shops and art galleries, is an ever-changing terrain for a stroll-and-stop type of peregrination. Yet, there may be moments when a walker feels unable to go one more block without some nourishment. Not a full-fledged meal, but merely a warm drink or a light snack to refuel the spirits. And not at an unwelcoming spot, with minimums and disapproving glances, but rather at a comfortable place to cool the heels - or these days, warm the toes.\nThe following is a select list of weekend possibilities, arranged in a more-or-less geographic order running from south to north:\nChez Laurence, Madison Avenue at 38th Street (683-0284). This small cafe-cum-pastry shop takes on a decided French air from its black-frocked, white-aproned waitresses. A wonderfully flaky warm croissant, served with the shop's own fruit preserves ($1.25), would go well with a frothy cappuccino ($1.75). Standouts in the pastry department are a lampion (a dense brioche-shaped cake with almond paste) at $2.25, and a mally tranche (an almond-flavored slice of brioche that leaves a shower of powdered sugar in the lap) at $1.75. A bran brioche studded with raisins ($1.50) is a recent experiment. A densely populated spot at breakfast and lunch hours, the cafe takes on a more relaxed pace midmorning or midafternoon. Fridays, 7 A.M. to 6:30 P.M.\nGrand Central Oyster Bar, lower level of Grand Central Terminal (490-6650). The takeout window, situated to the right of the main entrance of the Oyster Bar restaurant, is a convenient stand-up way station for a choice of some 14 oysters (95 cents to $1.85 apiece). Even more appealing on a cold day is a restorative bowl of New England or Manhattan clam chowder ($2.45). Beer, wine by the glass and mineral water are served. Fridays, 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 4 to 6:30 P.M.\nMuseum of Modern Art Garden Cafe, 11 West 53d Street (708-9400). This refreshingly spartan and capacious cafe is a welcome relief from the crush of the city streets, and from its expanse of wide windows, one may contemplate Picasso's ''She-Goat,'' Rodin's ''Monument to Balzac,'' Henry Moore's ''Ani-mal Form,'' Claes Oldenburg's ''Geometric Mouse,'' and others. There are various possibilities for a light snack: for example, fruit yogurts ($1.25) with a Perrier ($1.25), hot chocolate ($1) with a pumpkin muffin ($1.30), or a cheese-and-fruit basket ($3.75) with a glass of red wine ($2.85). Fridays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.\nThe Market, Citicorp Center, Lexington Avenue at 53d Street. Early morning or midafternoon, the center plaza of the Market resembles a peaceful, clean-swept little city square, where people relax with the daily newspaper at cafe tables under a filigree of green foliage. Various takeout shops in the mall provide light fare. At Cafe Buon Giorno (355-1914), there's hot cider (92 cents), egg cream ($1.25) or espresso ($1.34), but for an accompanying pastry, segue to Au Bon Pain (838-6996) for an enormous, swirling pancake-flat cinnamon or pecan roll ($1); Fridays, 6:30 A.M. to 8:30 P.M., Saturdays, 9 A.M. to 8:30 P.M. and Sundays, 9 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. At Healthworks! (838-6221), there's frozen yogurt ($1.85), and at Nyborg & Nelson, a light gravelax sandwich ($4.95). Hours at Healthworks!: Fridays, 7 A.M. to 8 P.M.: Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. and Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Hours at Nyborg & Nelson: Fridays, 7 to 10 A.M. and 11:30 A.M. to 9 P.M. and Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 7 P.M.\nThe Casual Quilted Giraffe, 15 East 55th Street, at the A.T.&T. Arcade (593-1221). This double-tier diner, with gray leather banquettes and black granite tables, gives on to the cathedral-like arcade of Philip Johnson's Chippendale-topped skyscraper. Designed as an alternative space to the sumptuous Quilted Giraffe restaurant, the Casual Quilted Giraffe offers grazing food at more manageable prices. As a midafternoon booster, there are addictive little puffy pizzas combining ricotta cheese laced with Japanese wasabi mustard ($12), a root-beer float ($6) or one of the best malted milks in town ($6). Next door is the Casual Quilted Giraffe's just-opened companion with the very British-sounding name of the Lunchbox Clubbe and Kerryout. This offers cut-above-the-deli box lunches for midtown workers, yet if you want something appropriate to savor as you gaze in Tiffany's windows around the corner, there's a takeout of three caviar beggar's purses, a signature appetizer at the Quilted Giraffe, for $25. Fridays and Saturdays, 11:30 A.M. to 11:30 P.M.\nI.B.M. Arcade, Madison Avenue at 56th Street (407-3500). This spacious plaza, with spruce-green park benches and tall bamboo trees, has the atmosphere of a rather Dickensian town square this time of year, with its old-fashioned lamplights decked out with spiraling holiday wreaths. After a perusal of ''Tokyo: Form and Spirit,'' the exhibition of objects and images from the 19th century through the present, on view at the I.B.M. Gallery of Science and Art just off the arcade, a stroller might seek the form and spirit of refreshment. At the circular snack bar, why not a warm croissant and mulled cider or a cranberry muffin and herbal tea ($1.25 and $1, respectively)? Fridays and Saturdays, 8:30 A.M. to 4 P.M.\nTrump Tower, Fifth Avenue at 57th Street (832-2929). A little hideaway amid the hustle and bustle of Trump Tower is the vestpocket cafe tucked into a corner of Level 5. With a skylight overhead, it perches above the gushing marble waterfall and the lower levels' brass glitter. Adding to the benign setting is the unhurried service - sandwiches are prepared only when ordered, for example. The food arrives direct from the kitchen of the excellent Terrace Five restaurant across the way. A bracing choice would be the chef's soup of the day, which might turn out to be a cream of pumpkin or split pea ($4). Terrace Five itself - a minimal and sparkling setting - has recently introduced an afternoon tea, which rivals the Old-World classics to be found in the neighborhood (at the Palm Court at the Plaza, Fifth Avenue at 59th Street; the Rotunda at the Pierre, Fifth Avenue at 61st Street; the Pembroke Room at the Lowell, 28 East 63d Street; Le Regence, 37 East 64th Street; the Mayfair Lounge at the Mayfair Regent, Park Avenue at 65th Street). The Terrace Five's assorted tea sandwiches cost $8.50, but there are other temptations, such as a glass of champagne and one of the delicious homemade cakes ($5). A hot buttered rum ($6.50) is a real pick-me-up. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 3 P.M. Terrace Five tea, from 3 to 5:30 P.M. Tasting Bar, Bloomingdale's, Lexington Avenue at 59th Street (705-2992). This clublike nook on the ground level of Bloomingdale's has a small holly-green bar surrounding a center island where you can watch your order assembled. Midafternoon, the Tasting Bar is a haven for a sprightly dish of minted fresh pineapple ($2) and one of the SoHo Sodas ($1.50). If you're still in a celebratory holiday mood, and price is no object, there's a Petrossian platter ($18) of smoked salmon and two caviars, served with toast and creme fraiche and a glass of champagne. Fridays and Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.\nL'Omnibus, 21 East 61st Street (980-6988). If a sophisticated, pampering atmosphere is called for, this elegant Art Deco bistro might fill the bill. Sharing the kitchen with Maxim's, L'Omnibus offers alternative light fare at lightweight prices. During the low-key hours of 3 to 6 P.M., one could curl up in a plump cushioned booth for a gratinee des Halles (cheese-topped onion soup) for $3.95, or a gateau de fromage aux fraises (a cheesecake with strawberries) at ($4.50) and espresso ($2.50). Fridays through Sundays, noon to 10:30 P.M.\nNirvana, 30 Central Park South (486-5700). Push the elevator button for the 15th floor at this address, and you will find yourself in an aerie with an incomparable view running to the tip of Central Park and beyond. While this Indian restaurant with its spangly, fussy decor would be more appealing when the lights were low, it's the view - particularly on a sunny, crisp winter afternoon - and the fact that the menu offers unusual light treats that make it worth a detour. Notably, there is a choice of seven breads ($2.95 to $4.95) - including the awesome balloon-shaped whole-wheat poori made to order - which might go well with a beer. Or, if it's nothing more than a health drink you're after, try aam lassi, a blend of mangoes and homemade yogurt ($2.95). Fridays through Sundays, noon to 1 A.M.\nRumpelmayer's, in the St. Moritz Hotel, 50 Central Park South (755-5800). The bonus for a flagging shopper-stroller at this landmark establishment is to step in the door, plunk down on one of the dozen counter stools, and order a lemon ice cream soda ($3.95), chocolate marshmallow sundae ($4.70) or banana split ($5.70). Fridays through Sundays, 7 A.M. to 1A.M.\nFinally, for an Irish coffee pick-me-up, there's the Quiet Man, 40 West 45th Street (354-1432); Charley O's Bar and Grill, 33 West 48th Street (582-7141), and the Irish Pavilion, 130 East 57th Street (759-9040).

''Quality should remain the principal selling feature of products serving specialty health care markets, so most companies probably will enjoy healthy margins. And a lower corporate tax rate will give profits an extra lift.''\nLong-range prospects are also considered favorable. ''Changes in the health care markets over the next few years will probably offer new opportunities for innovative products,'' Value Line said. ''Notably, the burgeoning home health care market will require equipment that will enable patients to be treated under limited supervision.''\nWithin the medical supplies category, the advisory service has selected 11 stocks that are expected to outperform the market over the coming year.\nCarrying the highest ''timeliness'' rating are five issues: C. R. Bard, Biomet, Intermedics, Medtronic and Puritan-Bennett. In addition, stocks regarded as having ''a better-than-even chance'' of beating the market during 1987 are Abbott Laboratories, Bausch & Lomb, Johnson & Johnson, R. P. Scherer, Stryker and United States Surgical.\nIn discussing specialty product niches, the report noted that ''growing acceptance of angioplasty for treating obstructed blood vessels of heart attack patients is helping C. R. Bard to post record earnings.''\nMedtronic and Intermedics are benefiting from increasing sales of cardiac pacemakers, the survey said. Scherer is counting on a nutritional approach to the cardiovascular field, offering fish oil supplements that are said to reduce blood cholesterol levels.\nPuritan-Bennett is seen extending its home health care product line, ''while it launches a computer-based data collection system that should improve the efficiency of respiratory therapy departments in hospitals.'' Tobacco Stocks Favored\nTobacco stocks have consistently been one of the equity market's most profitable groups during the 1980's and Salomon Brothers expects this pattern to continue in 1987.\nFor the five years ending in 1985, for example, the tobacco industry showed the highest return on equity of all groups in Standard & Poor's 400-stock industrial index. During this period, the industry's return on equity averaged 20.3 percent. The drug industry ranked second with a return on equity of 19.2 percent, followed by the publishing group with 18.6 percent.\nThe average showing for 29 industries was a return on equity of 12.1 percent for the five years.\n''We believe that the tobacco industry will continue to be one of the leaders in profitability, based on projected earnings growth of 16 percent in 1986 and 26 percent in 1987,'' said Diana K. Temple, who follows tobacco issues for Salomon Brothers. ''This would compare with the flat earnings we expect for the S.& P. 400 in 1986 and the 22 percent expansion - before write-offs - we look for in 1987.''\nAccording to the firm's investment coding, stocks of four tobacco companies are expected to outperform the general equity market during the next 6 to 12 months. These are the Loews Corporation, Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco and U.S. Tobacco. Two other issues - American Brands and Universal Leaf Tobacco - are expected to match the market's overall performance. Merrill Turns Cautious\nMerrill Lynch suggests a cautious approach to investing as the new year begins.\n''We sense that 1987 will be a year of change and greater risk but not the end of the bull market for financial assets,'' said Robert J. Farrell, Merrill Lynch's chief market analyst, in assessing prospects last week. ''We think it makes sense to move cautiously at the outset and hold reserves, even though we think a good rally to start the year, as stocks rebound from tax selling, could be appealing to traders.''\nMr. Farrell has an extensive list of stock groups that he favors for the new year. The sectors include electrical equipment, airlines, auto accessory, chemical, paper and forest products, containers, pollution control, computer software and services, tires, mobile homes, office supplies, telephone, natural gas and selected drugs.\nRecently, Merrill Lynch market analysts have cited the likelihood that the Dow Jones industrial average could decline to as low as 1,700 or 1,750 -possibly in the first quarter of 1987 - before the bull market moves to new highs.\nMARKET PLACE
298	European Anger At 'Ramboism'	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DD103EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: WILL the new year bring a trade war?\nWILL the new year bring a trade war?\nThat danger has come closer with the announcement by the Reagan Administration that it will impose, by the end of this month, 200 percent tariffs on a broad variety of European goods, including French wine, British gin and Danish cheese.\nThe Europeans have reacted angrily; the French trade minister accused the United States of ''choosing the Rambo method.'' The European Community has vowed to retaliate by imposing counter-tariffs on American imports.\nBut the United States seems ready to take that risk rather than let stalled negotiations over a tariff dispute resulting from Spain's entry into the Community drag on much longer. To join the Community, Spain was required to impose tariffs on imported grains, which, according to the United States, will cost American farmers at least $400 million in lost sales. The Europeans say the United States estimate is too high.\nIs the American move just a bargaining ploy? Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States Trade Representative, said he ''wouldn't give odds'' on whether the proposed American tariffs would actually come into effect. He expects a counteroffer from the Europeans before the tariffs are imposed Jan. 30. But he denies that the United States is bluffing.\nObviously, no poker player but a lunatic ever announces that he is bluffing. Nevertheless, there is no reason to think the United States is merely bluffing - and many reasons to believe it has decided to adopt a tougher position toward the Europeans and also toward the Japanese, the Koreans, the Canadians, or any other country, to gain what it considers fairer treatment and greater market access for American exports. If this is Ramboism, so be it; but its objective is still to open markets, not to seal them off.\nConfidence that the trade deficit is improving may be running out. The Commerce Department announced this week that the United States deficit on merchandise trade climbed to a record $19.2 billion; imports were $37.8 billion, twice as much as United States exports of $18.6 billion. This report has shaken the Government and private economists who hoped the apparent improvement in the preceding three months marked a turn for the better in the trade deficit.\nDespite the fall in the dollar, the trade deficit in 1986 is estimated to have hit an all-time high of more than $170 billion, up from $148.5 billion in 1985. That translates into hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, lost income and threats to the survival of American farmers and industries.\nJust to achieve the modest growth forecast by the Administration for 1987 - 3.2 percent for real gross national product and 2 percent for the manufacturing sector - the Government is counting on a $30 billion to $40 billion improvement in the trade deficit. If that does not materialize, there would be a greater risk of recession, higher unemployment and a deeper budget deficit. The Administration's strategy of trying to reduce the trade deficit by depreciating the dollar and trying to preserve open trade would be blown out of the water.\nPolitically, the Administration does not have much time to get out in front on the trade issue. The loss of control of the Senate to the Democrats will make it harder for President Reagan to block protectionist legislation in the coming year. That is one reason that the Administration, without waiting for Congress to act, has confronted the Europeans with what amounts to an ultimatum on imposing the 200 percent tariffs by the end of this month.\nWhether this ultimatum leads to a trade war will depend on how seriously the Europeans take the American threat, how they see their interests ultimately affected and how committed they really are to preserving the essentially, if imperfectly, open trading system that has contributed so much to world economic development in the postwar period.\nWest Germany and the other European countries and Japan and the newly industrialized countries of East Asia, which have relied on an export-oriented strategy, have experienced the greatest growth in their history.\nBut that export strategy for growth depended, more and more, on the willingness and capacity of importing countries to increase their debts. The threatened world debt debacle, the slowdown of economic growth and the emergence of gluts throughout the world in industry and agriculture are intensifying strains on the open trading system.\nRecognizing the dangers of another breakdown in that system, such as the one that shattered the world economy in the 1930's, the United States, the Europeans and the Japanese unquestionably do not want an all-out trade war.\nThe present pulling and tugging between America and Europe could turn out to be a ''phony war,'' aimed at protecting particular economic interests and appeasing political pressures, but without inflicting too much damage on other countries.\nHowever, what may begin as a ''phony war,'' the term used to describe the seeming stalemate on the Western front in Europe during the early months of World War II, could erupt into an all-out trade war. Nations go all out when they feel their most important interests threatened.\nECONOMIC SCENE

Announcement Applauded\nDressed in glittering gold vestments, John Paul concluded his homily today by saying, ''May 1987 be a year in which humanity finally puts aside the divisions of the past, a year in which, in development and solidarity, each heart seeks peace.''\nSpontaneous applause from the congregation in St. Peter's greeted the announcement of the special Marian year. Before the year begins, the Pope said he would issue an encyclical, a special pastoral letter addressed to the world's more than 800 million Catholics, that will be dedicated to the Virgin.\nThe proclamation of a Marian year in 1953-54 was to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. The church teaches that Mary was born free of original sin, that she conceived Christ by an act of divine intervention and that she was assumed bodily into heaven.\nThe Polish-born Pope has shown a special devotion to the Virgin, often traveling long distances to visit important Marian shrines like Lourdes in France or Fatima in Portugal, where the Virgin is believed to have performed miracles. Bishops Have Been Informed\nA statement issued by the Vatican today said Catholic bishops around the world had been informed of the Pope's plan for the Marian year.\nRather than requesting pilgrimages to Rome, the statement said each diocese would be organizing seminars, charitable projects and religious events centered on Marian shrines during the year.\n''O Mary, we want you to shine on the horizon of our age as we prepare for the third millennium of the Christian age,'' the Pope said today.\nJohn Paul issued a 20-page message on Dec. 11 in honor of the World Day of Peace, in which he begged terrorists to cease using violence to further their political aims even if their goals were just. The message, delivered to governments around the world, also cited the arms race, closed frontiers, third world debt problems and technological advances as threatening world peace.

But they are more than just dolls to Mrs. Hoyte, the owner and curator of Aunt Len's Doll and Toy Museum in Harlem. They are a livelihood.\nLenon Holder Hoyte's ''babies,'' as she refers to them, are made of bisque and china, rather than sugar and spice. But they are more than just dolls to Mrs. Hoyte, the owner and curator of Aunt Len's Doll and Toy Museum in Harlem. They are a livelihood.\nWhat began as a hobby for Mrs. Hoyte has become a museum of more than 5,000 rare and antique dolls, displayed in glass cases in the living room, the dining room and the basement of her home at 6 Hamilton Terrace. The museum is open to visitors by appointment only.\nMrs. Hoyte, 81 years old, began her collection in 1962, after displaying dolls at a charity show for Harlem Hospital. Today, Mrs. Hoyte, a Manhattan native who taught in New York City public schools for 41 years, is the manager and tour guide of her museum, which officially opened in 1974.\nWhat determines a doll's worth varies, depending upon its age, condition, manufacturer and the popularity of its genre. ''The value of a doll is determined by the quality of the bisque and whether it is wearing its original clothing,'' said Dana Hawkes, head of the collectibles department at Sotheby's in Manhattan. In the early 19th century, dolls were primarily made of bisque (unglazed ceramic ware), according to Ms. Hawkes, and before that, they were crafted from wood.\nIn the past decade antique dolls have gained in popularity as collectibles. ''When dolls started fetching more than $1,000, beginning in the 1970's, it was fairly significant,'' Ms. Hawkes said. ''People can be pretty nostalgic.''\nMrs. Hoyte owns more than 100 dolls that have won prizes at annual shows by the United Federation of Doll Clubs. She was one of the first blacks to join the federation, which has its headquarters in Parkville, Mo. In December, Mrs. Hoyte was presented with an Ethnic New Yorker Award by Mayor Koch. The awards are given in recognition of outstanding efforts at improving the quality of life in the city. Well Known by Collectors\nAccording to Krystyna Goddu, editor of Dolls: The Collector's Magazine, Mrs. Hoyte's name is legendary in the collectors' world for her extensive display of early French bisque dolls and rare black dolls.\nMost valuable collections include Queen Anne dolls (wooden dolls made in the late 18th century), papier-mache dolls and early French Jumeau and Bru dolls (named for their manufacturers), Mrs. Goddu said. And Mrs. Hoyte's collection contains all of these.\nMrs. Hoyte's black dolls are probably her most valuable. Most were made in Europe in the 19th century for the American market, and many typify the stereotypes of the day -for example, the exaggerated features of the Aunt Jemima dolls on display. Current Editions\nIn contrast, the current editions of black dolls such as the Huggy Bean, made in 1985 by a Manhattan manufacturer specializing in black dolls, are attractive representations of real people. This doll is on display as well.\nOne of Mrs. Hoyte's favorites - a baby doll in a dress with wide eyes and long eyelashes - was crafted in mahogany in 1977 by a California artist, Patty Hale. Mrs. Hoyte bought the doll last August at a doll convention in Chicago, but most of the items in her collection were purchased at flea markets and art shows in New York City.\nThe history of a doll can increase its value. Mrs. Hoyte owns two papier-mache dolls, Lillian and Leo, made by Leo Moss, a black handyman who lived in Atlanta during the late 19th century.\nAs the story goes, after Mr. Moss and his wife and children parted, he was so grief-stricken that he would only make dolls with tears - Lillian and Leo are two examples. Crying dolls of this type are now exceedingly rare, Mrs. Goddu said.\nJulie Collier, head of the collectibles department at Christie's in Manhattan, said early French dolls are currently the most in demand. Christie's began selling dolls on a regular basis in the mid-1960's and now holds doll sales four times a year. ''A French Bru doll 20 years ago would have sold for about $200,'' Ms. Collier said. ''Now, the same doll would run for about $8,000 to $12,000.'' But the average price for an antique doll in good condition is $300, she said. By this yardstick, Mrs. Hoyte's collection is quite valuable, but the museum owner would not estimate its worth.\nWhat one pays for dolls does not guarantee value, said Shirley Buchholz, a past president of United Federation of Doll Clubs. ''Lots of very fine dolls, dolls that have been well maintained and have retained their original clothing, are not necessarily the most expensive dolls,'' she said.\nAccording to Mrs. Hoyte, all a doll needs to make it a collectors' item is a past. ''Dolls are special because they have a history,'' she said. ''You can see it in their clothing and the blush of their faces.''\nFor an appointment to visit Aunt Len's museum, call 212-926-4172.

Lehman Jr. put them into his budget only recently.\nNot that he made any attempt to hide them. Senator John W. Warner, a former Navy Secretary himself and a Republican representing Virginia, where such ships are built at Newport News, had hinted that the Federal budget to be unveiled on Monday would include funds for carrier construction. And just before Christmas, the Pentagon spokesman, Robert Sims, breaking the Defense Department's official embargo on premature release of information about the military spending budget, announced spontaneously at a news briefing that funds for the carriers would be included in the budget.\nImmediately, people in Washington who follow military affairs began to speculate about why the carriers, which will cost about $6.9 billion to build and billions more to equip and operate, appeared from nowhere. A Kind of Fiscal Decoy? The most popular explanations had nothing to do with the Navy's maritime strategy, which is based largely on the power of action groups centered upon nuclear carriers. Rather, the speculation was that either the Pentagon was doing its bit, however small, to distract attention from the Iran arms affair or the Navy was floating out these two ships as a kind of fiscal decoy. Knowing they would be cut by a stingy Congress, why not ask for two? If both were eliminated, other programs might be untouched; if only one was sunk, all the better.\nWhether such motives were involved or the Navy simply wanted to speed the arrival of the two new carriers, modeled after the Nimitz, one thing appears certain: The new ships will dominate the debate over the Navy's budget this winter and spring.\nFor two years the Navy, which has been building up its fleet of carriers so as to have 15 of them on station in the 1990's, has put off construction of the new ships.\n''There are no aircraft carriers in the 1986 budget, or the five-year projection, and no new construction carriers are needed until the early 1990's,'' the service's presentation to Congress said two years ago. Last year, it said: ''Looking ahead, the Navy will have to order replacements for some of its carriers in the early 1990's if it is to sustain a force of 15 into the next century.'' At some point, the carrier Midway would need to be replaced, according to the plan.\nAccording to those who oppose the new carriers, now is not the time to seek a big increase in naval spending. Already the Pentagon's anticipated request for $312 billion to be spent in the fiscal year 1988 is expected to be reduced to about the same level as the 1987 budget plus an allowance for inflation. By this arithmetic, the entire military will be lucky to achieve a budget of $300 billion.\nSome say it would seem unfair to be generous to the Navy while other military forces suffer the effects of a continuing freeze on spending.\n''I cannot comprehend any rational reason for buying two new aircraft carriers at the expense of Army programs across the board,'' Representative William L. Dickinson, ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said in a letter to Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger this week. He predicted that if room has to be made for more ships and strategic weapons, the Army's share of the military budget would shrink below one fourth of the funds available.\n''Funds do not exist to fully equip the current fleet of carriers with the proper numbers of aircraft,'' said Mr. Dickinson, an Alabamian. ''And the costs of aircraft, support forces, and operations for two additional ships would be staggering.''\nThe Navy says that buying two ships for $6.9 billion would be $3 billion cheaper than buying them one by one. And only a tenth of the price would be due in 1987, for parts that would have to be ordered far in advance of launching the ships.\nBut spending that money is likely to become an occasion for another debate over the maritime strategy itself, a strategy that calls, in Mr. Lehman's favorite phrase, for sailing the big ships into harm's way.\nThat strategy is one of the favorite targets of military reformers. 'Plausible? No'\n''Is it plausible that a 15-carrier fleet would succeed in conducting offensive operations in high threat areas, notably Murmansk and Petropavlovsk, as contemplated in the maritime strategy? No,'' said Joshua M. Epstein, military budget analyst at the Brookings Institution, at a recent forum where he squared off against the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Carlisle A. H. Trost.\nTo do the job, Mr. Epstein says, would require at least 26 aircraft carriers, at a cost of $275 billion over a decade. He says it would be more appropriate to cut the number of carriers to 12, obviating the need for the two new ships and saving $30 billion in total costs over 10 years, including expenses for aircraft, escorts, sailors and supplies.\nWASHINGTON TALK: PENTAGON

But startled and irate viewers bombarded the stations with phone calls asking why Mr. Kohl was wearing different suits on each channel.\nA spokesman for the opposition Social Democratic party, Gunter Verheugen, sought to play down the mix-up, noting that Mr. Kohl in his 1987 address had ''talked past people's problems just the way he did last year.''

'No Intentional Mix-up'\n''There are no indications of an intentional mix-up,'' the station's executives said.\nBut they said a further investigation was needed to determine why last year's tape had been taken from archives and brought to the studio just in time for this year's broadcast.\nThe station broadcast Mr. Kohl's address for 1987 tonight.

Fifty years ago today, though, this was the scene of bravado, determination and tense confrontation as a struggle between capital and labor took place that would change the way industrial America was operated.\nControl of the two plants was seized by a small band of organizers for the then tiny United Automobile Workers and a portion of the work forces in a sitdown strike that began on Dec. 30, 1936. Instead of walking off their jobs, the workers shut down their machines and stayed in the plant, defying the giant General Motors Corporation to oust them.\nAlthough plants in other cities were involved in the effort to gain recognition for the union from G.M., Flint was the manufacturing heart of the company, and the two Fisher Body plants quickly became the focus of the battle. Battles Possible This Year\nFisher 1, quiet now for a vacation shutdown, could figure in labor battles in 1987, too. General Motors has said the 65-year-old plant will be permanently closed by next December, displacing the 3,000 people working there. It is a measure of what the union has won for workers that local officials say all but 600 will be eligible for other jobs, retirement or pay until retirement.\nBut the current top leaders of the union say they do not plan to stand idly by as the company closes plants in the United States while making arrangements to import cars and components from overseas. They say job security and the transfer of work to outside suppliers will be among the main issues on the table when negotiations for a new contract start this summer.\nIn 1937 the union's victory in Flint marked a major turning point in labor's effort to organize masses of semiskilled assembly line workers, according to Sidney Fine, a professor of history at the University of Michigan who is the author of a book on the Flint sitdowns. ''There's no question that this is what made the U.A.W. and the C.I.O.,'' he said. ''All the other C.I.O. unions were holding their breath as this little union brought a huge corporation to terms.'' It Is a Company Town\nFlint, then and now, is a company town and the company is General Motors. It is still the home of the Buick Motor Division, which was the cornerstone on which William C. Durant built the company into what would become the world's largest manufacturing corporation. In the mid-1930's it was estimated that 80 percent of the city's families were dependent in some way on the G.M. payroll.\nWorking conditions in the plants at the time were difficult, by all contemporary accounts, with abusive foremen common and speed-ups in the assembly line's pace frequent. There was widespread unrest among workers, but the company's vast network of spies, its ability to dismiss organizers and its total control of the city's political structure had foiled previous attempts at unionization.\n''We were glad somebody was finally getting around to doing something'' when the sitdown started, Howard Washburn, who was a 22-year-old stamping press operator in Fisher 1, recalled recently. ''Thing's were pretty bad in that shop.''\nSince walkouts were often ineffective in the Depression, because employers could quickly hire new workers from the ample ranks of the unemployed, the union resorted to sitdowns to interrupt production and put economic pressure on the company to go to the bargaining table. They Were Ahead of the Union\nThe Flint sitdowns seem to have caught both sides by surprise, according to later reports. ''It all happened before the union anticipated it would and before we were fully prepared,'' said Victor Reuther, who was an organizer for the auto workers in Flint at the time. Nevertheless, he said the union feared that General Motors was preparing to break sitdowns at plants in Cleveland and Atlanta and tht the union wanted to strike at the company's core before that could happen. ''We had a feeling they wanted to nip us in the bud,'' he said.\nUnion organizers quickly spread the word that the company was secretly moving key tools out of Fisher 1 to pre-empt a labor action, and the test was on.\nMr. Reuther is the only survivor of three brothers who were instrumental in the development of the union. Roy Reuther was heavily involved in the Flint sitdown, but Walter, who would later become a long-term president of the union, was based on the west side of Detroit at the time and had only limited participation.\nAngered by what executives and civic leaders considered an illegal seizure of company property, General Motors struck back with legal actions, and Flint's establishment used harassment and violence. The city police attacked the workers in Fisher 2 on Jan. 11 with tear gas and bullets in what has become known in union annals as the ''battle of the running bulls.'' The strikers fought back with fire hoses and heavy hinges fired from slingshots made of inner tubes stretched between steel columns. Thirteen strikers and sympathizers were wounded by police bullets that evening, but the workers kept control of the factory. Governor Sends in Guard\nAlarmed, Gov. Frank Murphy sent in the National Guard. Mr. Washburn said the strikers were alarmed at first by the presence of armed troops. ''We thought they would throw us out,'' he said. But after a short while it became clear that the troops were there mainly to protect the strikers and the numbers of workers staying in the plant gradually dwindled. ''I stayed in all 44 days, but not many did,'' Mr. Washburn said. ''After the first month it became pretty boring.''\nMr. Murphy's action was critical to the outcome, Mr. Fine said. ''The Guard acted as pickets and G.M. had no way to dislodge the workers.''\nWith its production crippled by the inactivity of the two Fisher plants and the later occupation of a key engine plant, the company gave in Feb. 11 and agreed to recognize the union in some of its plants. The union did not win much else in the way of wages an benefits; Mr. Washburn recalls the the first contract was on one sheet of paper. The current contract book runs to 487 pages.\nThe union leadership is taking a distinctly low-key approach to this critical event in its history. No events marking the start of the strike were held and the union's regional office in Flint will alone handle ceremonies commorating the settlement on Feb. 11, 1987.\nAt least part of the explanation can be found in the gains the union made in subsequent bargaining with General Motors. Union workers are now entitled a continuous vacation from Christmas Eve until the Monday after New Year's Day. The union's offices are closed along with the factories; top officials of both organizations are usually away on vacation.

In the process, apparently, he also came to harbor the AIDS virus. He tested positive at the County Health Department last March, he said.\nStill, he put on a skirt and went out at night, and the man the police arrested him with two weeks ago, Mr. McIntyre said, was married, white, gray-haired and overweight.\nHe was a well-known businessman here in the state capital, Police Chief L. C. Smith said, and when the police officer told him that he was with a man, not a woman, and that the man carried the AIDS virus, ''he like to went into shock.'' To Jail or the Street\nNow, aaccused of ''unnatural intercourse,'' a sodomy charge, Mr. McIntyre, 28, passes his days in an isolated cell while officials of Jackson and Mississippi debate how to resolve the danger they fear he poses.\n''The only things we can do with him is hold him, or put him back on the street,'' Chief Smith said. The authorities are also loath to keep him in the all-male environment of jail or prison, for fear of spreading the the AIDS virus there.\nConviction on the sodomy charge, a felony, could result in as much as 10 years in prison. But the District Attorney's office, which has to make the decision whether to prosecute, is undecided. ''I don't know what the hell direction we intend to take,'' Assistant District Attorney Tommy Mayfield said. ''We're sort of damned if we do and damned if we don't.''\nMr. Mayfield, shaking his head, said: ''I think anything anybody does is going to be passing the buck. The guy is obviously not going to quit doing what he does. And nobody, either in or out of this office, has come up with a workable plan.'' Quarantine Law Is Cited\nLooking to state health statutes for help, Mr. Mayfield cited Mississippi's quarantine law.\nIt reads, in short: ''The State Department of Health shall have the authority to investigate and control the causes of epidemic, infectious and other diseases affecting the public health, including the authority to establish, maintain and enforce isolation and quarantine, and in pursuance thereof, to exercise such physical control over property and individuals as the department may find necessary for the protection of the public health.''\nMississippi, with a largely rural and small-town population of 2.5 million, now has 48 people suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Dr. Ed Thompson, the state epidemiologist, said today. He said that the state's quarantine law wa one of the nation's strongest and that he would use it against Mr. McIntyre if prosecution failed.\nBut Dr. Thompson added that the quarantine process was cumbersome so that it assured protection of civil rights and that it was not intended to regulate adult sexual activity. ''We could proscribe this individual from having sexual activity with other individuals,'' he said, ''but how do you enforce that?'' A Death and a Surrender\nIn Houston earlier this year, Dr. Thompson said, the problem of an infected male prostitute who vowed to continue his trade was resolved when he died of AIDS. In Minneapolis this year a former male prostitute voluntarily identified himself as a carrier of AIDS and the owner of the male escort agency he had worked for agreed to begin giving the police the names of hundreds of former clients so they could be warned.\nIn the case here, Dr. Thompson said that if Mr. McIntyre hadbroken the law he should be prosecuted under it and imprisoned. ''He can be confined so that he doesn't spread it,'' he said. He said the larger problem was one of public awareness.\n''Having sex with any prostitute, especially a male prostitute, is taking your life in your hands,'' Dr. Thompson said.\nMr. McIntyre, a slight, soft-spoken man, denies committing the act he is charged him with. ''They said I gave him oral sex,'' Mr. McIntyre said. But he does not seem to understand the implications of the virus he carries or the need to avoid sexual contact with others. ''I've been told that I have the AIDS virus, but not AIDS,'' he said. ''But I don't feel like I have anything. I don't feel bad.''\nIn light of what is known about AIDS, Mr. McIntyre could be expected to carry the virus for the rest of his life, perhaps never getting the disease himself.\nMr. McIntyre said quietly: ''There's no way you can get rid of the virus? It just carries on? I always use condoms, so I couldn't transmit the virus, could I?'' A Bus Ticket Out of Town\nHe said he told his jailers in March that he carried the AIDS virus, but that it was a story he made up to to get out of jail. Then the jailers had him tested for the presence of antibodies and the test was posiitive.\nAfter that result, he said, some city vice detectives ''very quickly'' took him to the Jackson bus station and bought him a transcontinental bus ticket. ''It was to San Diego,'' the city from which his mother brought him here 10 years or so ago, he said. But two months ago, Mr. McIntyre said, he returned because his mother here was ill.\nAnd he returned to the streets, to the satisfaction he finds in skirts and heels and wigs, and men. ''I never thought about it,'' he said softly. ''I just always did it. It was just something that came natural to me to do.'' 'He's Selling Death'\nNow the natural inclination has become a practical and philosophic problem for heterosexuals and homosexuals alike. ''He's selling death, if you want to put it that way,'' says Eddie Sandifer, executive director of the Mississippi Gay Alliance.\nMr. Sandifer and Dr. Thompson agree that Mr. McIntyre is only a tiny part of the enormous medical and ethical problem of AIDS. The sad thing, Mr. Sandifer said, is that what Mr. McIntyre is alleged to have done is not much different from what many homosexual men who know they have tested positive for AIDS are still doing.\nFrequently, he said, they have their test results sent to the Gay Alliance office rather than to their homes. Sometimes they confide in Mr. Sandifer. ''We know who they are,'' Mr. Sandider said. Yet still, he said, he and other alliance members see ''these people going to the bars and the bookstores every night and picking up tricks.''\n''I don't think that what this guy in jail was doing is any worse than what a lot of other people are doing,'' he said. ''The only difference is that he is getting paid for it.''

The 63-year-old composer, who had had a heart condition, collapsed shortly after noon in a restaurant on Broadway and was dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital.\nLester Trimble, a composer, critic and music teacher, died Wednesday afternoon of heart failure. The 63-year-old composer, who had had a heart condition, collapsed shortly after noon in a restaurant on Broadway and was dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital.\nMr. Trimble composed symphonies, chamber works, operas and songs. He received honors and commissions from symphony orchestras, foundations and music societies.\nMr. Trimble's Symphony No. 3, ''The Tricentennial,'' commissioned for the City of Albany's 300th year, was given its premier performance last September by the Albany Symphony Orchestra. Last January he received an honorary doctorate from St. John's University at its commencement, for which he composed the processional music.\nAmong his best-known compositions are his Second Symphony (1968), which is based entirely on elements from a single lyrical theme, and a series of works he called ''panels,'' which are for diverse instrumental ensembles. Trained at Carnegie Tech\nBorn in Bangor, Wis., on Aug. 29, 1923, Mr. Trimble's musical training was acquired largely at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. After service in the United States Army, he studied at Tanglewood, where he met Darius Milhaud, with whom he subsequently studied in Paris. 'A Richer Melodic Gift'\nSettling in New York after returning from Paris in 1952, he was the music critic of The Nation, a music reviewer for The New York Herald-Tribune, managing editor of Musical America and executive director of the American Music Center.\nHe was professor of composition at the University of Maryland from 1963-68 and composer in residence with the New York Philharmonic from 1967-68, and he joined the Juilliard School faculty in 1971. In 1973 he became the first composer in residence at Wolf Trap Farm Park. He taught privately the past two years.\nWriting of the composer's String Quartet No. 1 in 1955, a New York Times critic wrote, ''He has a richer melodic gift than most, a delight in complex and vigorous rhythms, the ability to invent new sonorities without striving for far-fetched effects and considerable emotional intensity.''\nAfter a program at Town Hall in 1962 that covered a dozen years of Mr. Trimble's music, another Times critics wrote that all the works revealed some major virtues in common: ''a wide-ranging, seemingly inexhaustible melodic invention; intricate rhythmic patterns; an imaginative feeling for instrumental and vocal color.''\nMr. Trimble is survived by his wife, Constance Wilhelm, of Manhattan, and a brother, John R., of Massapequa.\nFuneral services are private, and a memorial service will be announced.

The police said they expected to continue searching through the night until they had accounted for the 30 occupants of the building, Raglin House on Sandymount Avenue in the fashionable Ballsbridge district.\n''It has not been possible to determine how many people were in the building at the time of the explosions, so we will continue to search until every item of debris is cleared,'' said Sgt. Bill Kelly of the police. Firefighter Is Injured\nA firefighter hit by a piece of falling masonry after the explosions was slightly injured.\nPrime Minister Garret FitzGerald, whose home is less than a mile away, went to the scene, where friends and relatives of the occupants had gathered. ''Everything possible is being done,'' he told reporters.\nThe police said the cause of the explosions, which took place at about 9:30 A.M., was not definitely known, but a gas leak was considered the most likely possibility. A smell of gas hung over the neighborhood, and the Dublin Gas Company confirmed it had investigated a reported leak in the area over the Christmas holiday. Son With Baby Sitter\nThe dead couple were identified by police as Michael Murphy, an employee of the Irish broadcasting network, RTE, and his wife, Noelle, a radiologist. Their 4-year-old son had been feared to be among the victims, but he was later found safe at the home of a babysitter.\nThe police were trying to locate the occupants of the building. The authorities issued nationwide radio appeals for residents of the building to contact them.\nWithin minutes of the explosions the police called in all available ambulances and fire equipment and put Dublin's biggest hospital, St. Vincent's, on alert.
310	LOAN COST SHIFT TO STUDENTS IS SOUGHT	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DB113EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Education Department officials say President Reagan will propose a major increase in an experimental student loan program in an effort to shift the costs of such loans from the Federal Government to the students.\nEducation Department officials say President Reagan will propose a major increase in an experimental student loan program in an effort to shift the costs of such loans from the Federal Government to the students.\nThat proposal is one of several ways in which groups representing colleges and universities expect the Reagan Administration to try to cut overall student aid in its budget for the fiscal year 1988, which Mr. Reagan will submit to Congress on Monday.\nBruce M. Carnes, the Deputy Under Secretary of Education in charge of budget, said the Administration would seek $600 million to expand the pilot program, which does not rely on Federal subsidies. Unlike existing plans, the new program requires students to pay full interest charges but offers more flexible repayment terms. The program was recently established on a pilot basis and financed at $5 million.\nAt a briefing Wednesday, Mr. Carnes outlined hopes for greatly expanding the new program, the Income Contingent Loan plan, but he declined to specify what cuts in student aid the department would be seeking.\n''The overall budget will look more like the $15.2 billion we requested for fiscal 1987 than the $19.5 billion level appropriated by Congress,'' Mr. Carnes said of the overall education budget, without going into detail. ''There will be reductions. No one is disputing that.'' 'There Is No Free Lunch'\n''Anyone now eligible for student aid will remain eligible for the same amount,'' he added. ''But the terms of getting it may be more onerous for them. There could be more loans than grants and more unsubsidized loans than subsidized. There is no free lunch. Someone has to pay the bill.'' Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, an organization representing all colleges and universities, said he expected the Administration to propose ''massive cuts comparable to what we've seen in the past several years.''\n''The substitution of loans for grants and the resulting increase in student indebtedness ought to concern us as a society,'' he said. ''Before we move any further toward loans, we must examine what we're doing. It's bad public policy to have a major shift in that direction.''\nMr. Atwell noted that Congress had consistently rejected proposals by the Administration for deep cuts in student aid.\nThe Administration's current effort to reduce Federal subsidies for student aid comes in the aftermath of a report on student debt released earlier this week by the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress.\nThe report warned that student borrowing under Federal programs had nearly tripled in the last 10 years, raising concern that debt would overburden a generation. In the same period, it said, Federal grants and scholarships declined by 62 percent.\nEducation Secretary William J. Bennett, however, has contended that the student loan program must be overhauled and that expensive Federal subsidies should be eliminated.\n''Switching the interest burden from the Government to the recipient would make it possible to offer large loans with longer repayment periods,'' he said in a recent speech. ''The college graduate will earn $640,000 more than the high school graduate over his lifetime. It is only sensible and fair that that beneficiary pay the cost, rather than the taxpayer.''\nThe Income Contingent Loan plan will require just that, by charging students interest from the time they begin to receive their loans, at the Treasury Bill rate plus 3 percent, which would currently amount to about 8.6 percent. It would set no fixed term of repayment but would link repayment to the student's later income with payments not to exceed 15 percent of income. Financial Impact on Students\nEligibility would depend on student financial needs, officials say. The program would be more expensive for students and their parents because the Government would not be paying any of the interest charges as it does in other programs. But, according to Mr. Carnes, it would prove helpful to them after graduation by taking their income into account in setting annual payments.\nThe Administration had at first sought $90 million a year for the program, but Congress adopted it in 1986 only on a limited, experimental basis involving $5 million a year for five years. It will enable eligible undergraduates at 10 schools to borrow a maximum of $17,500 over four years. Applications to select the 10 participating schools have not yet been sent out by the department.\nThe proposal in the Administration's budget calls for broadening the plan to 1,500 schools and including graduate students as well as undergraduates. The maximum total loan could run as high as $50,000.\nUnder the proposal, participating schools could offer no new loans under an existing loan plan, the National Direct Student Loan program, which the Administration hopes eventually to eliminate gradually. The direct loan program, which is entirely financed by the Government, benefits the most needy students. The plan charges no interest while students are in school and 5 percent for the 10-year repayment term after graduation. Its loan limit is $9,000.\nMr. Carnes said the Administration's budget would again seek no new money for that plan, as it has for several years. But the Administration will not try to eliminate the largest loan plan, the Guaranteed Student Loan program, or change the method of determining eligibility, he said.\nThat program, which entitles eligible undergraduates to borrow a maximum of $17,250 from private lenders under Federal guarantees, requires the student to pay no interest while in school. The borrower's interest rate goes from 8 percent to 10 percent over the 10-year repayment term after graduation. The Government pays the lender interest at the Treasury Bill rate plus 3.25 percent while the student is in school and pays the difference between the student's interest rate and the lender's charge until the loan is repaid. Cost of $3 Billion a Year\nAccording to Mr. Carnes, the guaranteed loan program costs the Government $2 billion a year in interest subsidies and $1 billion a year as a result of defaults. He suggested that the Income Contingent Loan program would help reduce defaults that result when the fixed repayment rate under the guaranteed loan program proves too burdensome for recent graduates' incomes.\nMr. Atwell of the American Council on Education and Richard Rossner, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, both said they objected to extending the experimental program before any results of the pilot program could be assessed.\n''I don't think we should prejudge the experiment and move to massive increases in something we don't understand very well,'' Mr. Atwell said.\nAnd Mr. Rossner said he feared the proposal was aimed at replacing both the direct loan program and the guaranteed loan program with one that would lead to higher debt for students and ''scare many students away from college.''\nAccording to Mr. Carnes, the other proposed increases in the department's budget are a $200 million increase in financing for remedial education for poor children, which would amount to a 5 percent rise, and a $24 million increase in financing for adult education, which would be 23 percent above the current level.

This week Gregory Ulas Powell, who was sentenced to life in prison for the Campbell murder, won a court order that may result in his freedom.\nThe California Supreme Court ruled that the State Board of Prison Terms erred four years ago by rescinding his scheduled 1983 parole date.\nMr. Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith, his co-defendant, were convicted of killing Officer Campbell on March 9, 1963, after disarming him and his partner, Karl Hettinger, in an onion field in Bakersfield. Mr. Hettinger survived.\nThe defendants were sentenced to death, but the verdicts were overturned by the California Supreme Court in 1969. Joseph Wambaugh's novel and subsequent movie, ''The Onion Field,'' were based on the crime and trial.\nOn Monday the Supreme Court voted 4 to 3 in favor of Mr. Powell's contention that the State Board of Prison Terms improperly relied on unproved evidence of sexual misconduct when it rescinded his 1983 parole date. #3 Justices Leaving Office The court, the state's highest, ruled in the final week of office for Chief Justice Rose Bird and Associate Justices Cruz Reynoso and Joseph Grodin, who suffered a resounding defeat in last month's confirmation election and will leave office Sunday.\nThe three were joined by Justice Allen Broussard in voting for freeing Mr. Powell.\nMr. Smith was paroled in 1982 but was jailed two years later for a parole violation. He was paroled again last month and is now reported living in the Los Angeles area.\nThe ruling brought immediate criticism from the police and prosecutors. John Van de Kamp, the State Attorney General, said he would press the court to rescind its decision. Mr. Van de Kamp, who as Los Angeles District Attorney personally campaigned to keep Mr. Powell in prison in 1982, said he would file a petition for a rehearing in the case within a week. Reactions Are Bitter\n''He doesn't belong on the street,'' said District Attorney Ira Reiner of Los Angeles. ''He belongs where he is right now, and that's behind bars for the rest of his life.''\nPolice Chief Daryl F. Gates of Los Angeles said he was ''absolutely shocked,'' noting that Mr. Powell had been ''twice sentenced to the gas chamber for the cold-blooded killing of a police officer.''\nOfficer Campbell's partner, Mr. Hettiner, who is now retired, said of the two defendants: '' They should have been executed. They executed my friend and my partner.'' Deukmejian Filling Court\nThis week Gov. George Deukmejian announced six choices for the Supreme Court. Three of the nominees will fill the vacancies created in the November election. Mr. Van de Kamp has said he hopes one of the replacements could side with the three dissenters in the Powell case to force a rehearing.\nIf the court agrees to rehear the case, Mr. Powell's release will be stayed, but if not he will be freed.\nThe Supreme Court first overturned his death sentence in 1969. After a new trial he was sentenced to death again, but that sentence was overturned in 1972 and his sentence was reduced to life in prison. That meant he was eligible for parole.\nDennis Riordan, Mr. Powell's attorney, had appealed the board's decision to a Superior Court judge who found the board had overstepped its authority. The Supreme Court's action affirmed the Superior Court order.

Already, Ivan F. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine, two highly successful and flamboyant speculators, were toppled by an investigation that revealed they had reaped tens of millions in profits by trading on privileged information.\nIn addition, five others pleaded guilty to crimes in connection with a loose network that swapped confidential information about mergers, takeovers and corporate restructurings to beat the market in executing trades.\nThe scheme began to unravel in May 1985, when an anonymous letter was sent from Caracas, Venezuela, to the New York headquarters of Merrill Lynch & Company. It alleged that two of the firm's salesmen had engaged in insider trading.\nThe letter triggered an investigation that led eventually to Mr. Levine, the investment banker at the center of the insider ring. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Levine used confidential information about transactions involving dozens of companies in trades that reaped profits of more than $12 million on an original investment of $170,000.\nMr. Levine, 34 years old, pleaded guilty in June to four felony counts. He surrendered more than $11 million in assets, but was allowed to keep his luxury apartment on Park Avenue. Facing a possible prison term of up to 20 years, he agreed to cooperate with authorities while awaiting sentencing.\nHe implicated Mr. Boesky, 49, who agreed to plead guilty to one criminal count and pay $100 million in restitution and fines - by far the largest penalty ever imposed for insider trading.\nThe S.E.C. has alleged that Mr. Levine supplied Mr. Boesky with tips that resulted in profits for Mr. Boesky of more than $50 million. Mr. Boesky's personal wealth was estimated at more than $200 million.\nBut critics of the S.E.C. have charged that after his illegal dealings were detected, Mr. Boesky made much more money on inside information of a different type. Because it was expected that a public announcement of the scandal would send the market into disarray, Mr. Boesky was permitted to continue to trade - and to pay off $1.4 billion worth of debt largely through the sale of equities. The S.E.C. maintained that it allowed Mr. Boesky to continue his trading to avert a market panic.\nBUSINESS PEOPLE: 1986'S NEWSMAKERS IN FINANCE

His ouster in October as Saudi Arabia's oil minister resulted in a new strategy by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and could bring higher prices and broader changes to the world oil industry.\nSheik Yamani was the most prominent and influential official in the world of Arab oil. Although he was instrumental in quadrupling OPEC's prices in the 1970's, he had been a moderating force in recent years. He had, for instance, engineered OPEC's policy of unrestrained production - which forced oil prices down - in an attempt to win a bigger share of the market.\nThe price decline led to his undoing. The Saudi royal family, under pressure from Iran, replaced him with Hisham Nazer, who has encouraged a closer relationship between the two countries.\nNow OPEC, aiming for an average price of $18 a barrel, has embarked on production cuts. Analysts, however, are skeptical that the target price can be maintained.\nSheik Yamani, 56 years old, had been the oil minister since 1962. Whatever his successes, he was always eloquent and colorful. As befitting a sheik, he dressed well and owned homes in Europe.\nNow Sheik Yamani is traveling with less fanfare. He showed up in Hong Kong in mid-December under an assumed name; he was said to be there for acupuncture treatments for an undisclosed ailment.\nBUSINESS PEOPLE: 1986'S NEWSMAKERS IN FINANCE

A hero of the emergency operation was a Republican Senator from Oregon, Bob Packwood, the 54-year-old chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986 will drastically alter how Americans pay their taxes, and much of the credit for its passage belongs to Mr. Packwood, a 19-year Senate veteran. A moderate who has often been at odds with the White House - he was removed as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 1982 after publicly criticizing President Reagan - Mr. Packwood became one of Mr. Reagan's staunchest allies on taxes.\nGetting the bill through committee hearings meant dodging hundreds of lobbyists - Mr. Packwood once called them ''assassins'' - who dogged his path for two months.\nIt also meant dealing with bickering Senators on the committee. When it looked as if the bill would be killed by special interests, Mr. Packwood ordered members behind closed doors. The panel finally voted 20-0 for the measure and gave the chairman a standing ovation.\nAnother obstacle lay in ironing out differences between the Senate and House versions. Mr. Packwood and his House counterpart, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, wrestled out a compromise. While the rest of Congress was on vacation, they presented the bill to the conferees, who adopted it. It passed the full House and Senate, and the President signed it into law Oct. 22.\nThe tax battle over, Mr. Packwood won re-election in November, but lost his chairmanship when Senate control went to the Democrats. He begins the new term, his fourth, as the committee's ranking minority member.\nBUSINESS PEOPLE: 1986'S NEWSMAKERS IN FINANCE

At times, Coach Bill Walsh had to cup his hands around his mouth and scream directions.\nBut the idea was to simulate the noise and distractions that sometimes confront the visiting team. Clamor at the End Zones\n''A lot of players have a hard time hearing, close near the end zones,'' Joe Montana said later. ''We have to get used to it.''\nFor some of them, the musical dimension was little more than a carryover from the night before, New Year's Eve, when they had attended a concert in the Oakland Coliseum featuring Huey Lewis and the News, a Bay Area band that burst into national prominence several years ago.\nOften, Huey and the News sing the national anthem before 49er home games and perform their own work at halftime. Huey has became friends with many of the 49ers and such good friends with four of them - Montana, Dwight Clark, Ronnie Lott and Riki Ellison - that he invited them to join the group as backup singers for two songs on their latest album, ''Hip to Be Square'' and ''I Know What I Like.''\nNot that all of them are necessarily great singers.\n''Dwight's the singer,'' said Montana. ''I think they turned my mike off.''\n''It must have taken us 1,000 takes to get it right,'' said Ellison, an inside linebacker. ''We had to do it until they liked it. Dwight's the singer. Joe's shy. I was just yelling.''\nBy Wednesday night somebody apparently thought they were ready for their concert debut. For the same two numbers they had recorded in the studio, Montana, Clark, Lott and Ellison joined the group on stage, singing their lines and dancing in unison as backup groups are supposed to do.\nOf course, that's not exactly the way it came out, even after they had spent about an hour trying to learn their steps. 'A Bull in a China Shop'\n''We didn't know what we were doing,'' Montana said. ''Riki was like a bull in a china shop.''\nBy practice today, any damage inflicted by Ellison was negligible, at most. Montana ran the offense with typical aplomb; the defense seemed to know how to react properly when the 49ers were simulating the Giants' offense.\nThe music aside, the practice was still serious, for this is no trivial matter. The Giants beat the 49ers the last two times they played, 17-3 in the National Conference wild-card game last season and 21-17 five weeks ago in Candlestick Park.\nThe most recent loss was especially disconcerting in that the 49ers played a near-perfect first half to lead by 17-0 and achieved what they intended on defense, stopping Joe Morris. But an 11-minute stretch in the third quarter cost them three touchdowns, and they never recovered.\nEven now, despite gaining just 14 yards on 13 carries in the last game, Morris remains the defense's biggest worry. ''He's one of the hardest guys in the league to tackle,'' said Ellison.\nEllison doesn't imagine the Giants will do much different this time. They built a 14-2 season on Morris's running, 1,516 yards worth, and timely passing by Phil Simms. ''So why would they change now?'' he said. Giants' Offense Respected\n''They have a good running game,'' Ellison said. ''But I'm sure they will try to keep us off-balance by mixing it up. That's why they're different than a team like the Rams. If you can stop Dickerson, you can win the game. With the Giants, you can't. They have a lot better passing game, better offensive linemen and a better defense.''\nAs for singers, well, that's another story.\n''I wouldn't mind catching them on their next tour,'' Ellison said of Huey and the group. ''I traveled to Arizona with them once two years ago. They let me come on stage and beat up a couple of a drums.'' N.F.L. PLAYOFFS

Most Were on Probation\nOf those under any form of supervision, 64.4 percent were on probation, 17.3 percent were in prison, 8.7 percent were in jail and 9.6 percent were on parole, the report said.\nThis means that about three-fourths of the adults under supervision at the end of 1985 were in the community, with the 26 percent remaining incarcerated, according to the report.\nThe report noted that in the last two years the number of adults placed on probation rose faster than the number who were imprisoned. The probation population rose 18 percent, to reach a record of 1.9 million adults, while the number of people incarcerated rose 15 percent, to 750,000 adults.\nStu Smith, a spokesman, said the bureau could not determine whether the disparity between the incarceration and probation figures meant that more people were committing minor crimes or that judges were less likely than in the past to sentence defendants to prison. He said that available prison space had decreased in recent years.\nStatistics were compiled by state, with 43 states reporting increased probation populations in 1985.\nThe report also noted that of the 2.9 million adults under correctional supervision, nearly 87 percent were male; 65 percent were white, 34 percent were black, and 1 percent were of other races.

That is about the same as the increase expected for 1986.\nIn all, the department predicted that 70 percent of manufacturing industries would see their shipments rise in 1987, the second-highest such figure since 1978.

Shipments of manufactured goods last declined during the recession year of 1982, when they fell 4.5 percent.\nMr. Brown said the gap between the fastest-growing industries and the slowest performers is expected to narrow to the smallest spread in 15 years.\nThe gap in growth rates was 29 percent in 1983 but is expected to be only 9 percent in 1987 between the manufacturing industries in the top 10 percent of growth and those in the bottom 10 percent. Broader Participation Seen\n''A broader range of industries will participate in the overall moderate growth,'' Mr. Brown said.\nThe department said the semiconductor industry would enjoy the fastest growth in manufacturing, an expected 26.5 percent rise in shipments. At the other end of the spectrum, shipments of turbine generators are projected to decline by 62.4 percent this year.\nIn the services category, mutual funds are expected to top the list, with a growth in assets of 28 percent.\nThe estimates are based on an economic forecast that calls for the nation's trade deficit to shrink by between $30 billion and $40 billion next year, providing relief for American manufacturers that have lost ground to imports.\nFollowing semiconductors, the top manufacturing growth industries in 1987 should be in electronic capacitors, with an 11.5 percent increase in shipments, and optical devices and lenses, with an 11 percent projected growth rate.\nManufacturers of X-ray devices are expected to see growth in shipments of 10.9 percent, while producers of electrical measuring devices will see 10 percent growth. Others in Top 10\nOther companies in the top 10 were manufacturers of automotive stampings, with projected growth of 9.4 percent; surgical appliances, 8.8 percent; adhesives and sealants, 8.3 percent; particle board, 8.2 percent, and missiles and space vehicles, with a rise of 8 percent.\nIn the services category, mutual funds will be followed by management, consulting and public relations firms, with an expected 18 percent rise in revenues. Property and casualty insurance companies will be next with a 14 percent rise, followed by a 12.8 percent increase in revenues of data processing companies.\nNext on the services list were life insurance, savings and loan associations and medical service providers, all with expected increases of 10 percent; franchise sales operations, with an 8.6 percent increase; advertising, up 7.8 percent, and commercial banking, up 7 percent in asset growth.\nIn addition to the big decline expected for turbine makers, other manufacturing companies in the expected bottom 10 of performers for 1987 are metal-cutting machines, with an expected decline in shipments of 13.2 percent, followed by paperboard mills, structural metal fabricators, special die and tool makers, and manufacturers of photoengraving equipment, car bodies, games and toys, metal-forming machines and shoes, all with declines in shipments of 6 percent or more.
318	A Busy Year for Bankers, Regulators	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DD1E3EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In banking and finance, 1986 brought changes that will not end with the turning of the calendar. As more states ease their banking laws, more banks are crossing state lines, a trend that is expected to grow this year. And even as the Reagan Administration continues its relaxed posture on business regulation, the regulators themselves are making news.\nIn banking and finance, 1986 brought changes that will not end with the turning of the calendar. As more states ease their banking laws, more banks are crossing state lines, a trend that is expected to grow this year. And even as the Reagan Administration continues its relaxed posture on business regulation, the regulators themselves are making news.\nAmong last year's newsmakers in finance was Walter V. Shipley, chairman of the Chemical New York Corporation, who took a $1.1 billion gamble on buying a bank in the heart of the depressed oil and real estate markets of Texas. Chemical plans to buy the Houston-based Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc., whose chairman, Ben Love, has been seeking a new source of funding.\nMeanwhile, Gerald W. Fronterhouse, chairman of the Republicbank Corporation, had expressed similar faith in Texas's long-range health. Republic plans to buy its weaker Dallas rival, the Interfirst Corporation, headed by Robert H. Stewart 3d.\nRegulators came to the fore nearly as much as those they regulated. Gary Lynch, director of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, sent chills through Wall Street with his attack on insider trading. His boss, John S. R. Shad, the chairman of the S.E.C., used the scandals to bolster his plea for more funding for the enforcement agency.\nAt the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, L. William Seidman battled the growing problem of bank failures with ways to make it easier for healthy banks to acquire failing ones. And at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the chairman, Edwin J. Gray, had another kind of problem. He apologized to Congress for allowing some of his personal expenses to be picked up by the thrift-industry institutions his agency regulates.\nRobert E. Brennan of First Jersey Securities, who has been fighting Federal fraud charges, decided to sell the firm's retail branch system to the Sherwood Capital Group. Frederic W. Rittereiser, First Jersey's chairman, planned to join Sherwood.\nMr. Rittereiser's brother, Robert P. Rittereiser, took on the added title of chief executive at E. F. Hutton and proceeded to cut costs and employees to help the firm's performance.\nThe Japanese pressed their attention on Wall Street. John L. Weinberg, chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, sold a 12.5 percent interest in the firm to the Sumitomo Bank. And Peter Rona, chief executive of the J. Henry Schroder Bank, agreed to buy Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a big American bond company. The Japanese connection is that Schroder is a unit of the Industrial Bank of Japan.\nTreasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d continued United States efforts to revive the world economy by trying to pursuade Japan and West Germany to adopt growth policies.\nOverseas, Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, had his hands full as the ''Big Bang'' ushered in a deregulated and more competitive era. Meanwhile, in Brazil, President Jose Sarney provoked antigovernment demonstrations as he lifted popular price freezes that had triggered a flurry of consumer spending.\nA ROUNDUP OF OTHER HEADLINERS IN FINANCE
319	THE FUTURE IS NOW FOR FIESTA COMMITTEE	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDD1E3EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: College football fans are interested in Friday night's Fiesta Bowl between Penn State and Miami because it will decide which team will finish No. 1 in the country this season. The game, however, will serve another purpose as well. It is an experiment, an opportunity to test the concept of a football playoff to determine a true national champion, rather than one chosen by a panel of sports reporters and coaches in the news-agency polls.\nCollege football fans are interested in Friday night's Fiesta Bowl between Penn State and Miami because it will decide which team will finish No. 1 in the country this season. The game, however, will serve another purpose as well. It is an experiment, an opportunity to test the concept of a football playoff to determine a true national champion, rather than one chosen by a panel of sports reporters and coaches in the news-agency polls.\nA playoff would be popular with the fans and television networks. Some college administrators and coaches, Joe Paterno of Penn State, most notably, favor it, too. Others, for example, Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach, oppose a playoff for various reasons.\n''The Fiesta Bowl is not really a bowl game for us,'' Johnson said. ''There is no way we can enjoy the festivities like a regular bowl game. The pressure has made this a difficult situation.'' Weighing the Burden\nEven Paterno said he is monitoring this week's events to determine whether a national championship game is worth the added burden it places on the respective coaching staffs and players. ''This is the closest we've come to a game like that,'' he said. ''Maybe, it is too big. Maybe, it's not worth it. But I think it can be a fun situation, a once in a lifetime thing.''\nThe Fiesta Bowl committee is proceeding under the assumption the game will receive rave notices all around. Don Meyers, a local attorney and chairman of the team selection committee, said that sometime before next April he would formally request the Post-Season Committee of the National Collegiate Athletic Association to amend its bylaws to allow a team more than one post-season football game.\nThe plan, Meyers said, was for the Fiesta Bowl to be held on or about Jan. 15 next year, two weeks after the New Year's Day bowl games. The two teams would be selected from among the winners of those games.\n''I think this will go a long way toward determining a national championship, to meet the objectives of the fans,'' he said. Problems With Playoff\nMeyers does not think there is enough support among college administrators and coaches for a post-season playoff. Football seasons are considered to be too long already. And a playoff would necessitate a small post-season tournament field with teams chosen arbitrarily, perhaps using the news-agency rankings as a reference point. Ultimately, good teams, even conference winners, would be excluded.\nThere is also a reluctance to upset the traditional New Year's bowl games, which have been a lucrative reward for the schools, as well as a means of determining the final rankings. In order to gain the support of those bowls - the Rose, Sugar, Cotton and Orange - for his plan, Meyers is proposing that a rotation system be implemented so that each of those bowls would take turns serving as host for the so-called national championship game in mid-January.\n''We could have a representative of each bowl, one from the N.C.A.A., and perhaps a representative from each of the wire services, choose the two teams that would be invited to the game,'' Meyers said. ''We would pay each team $2.5 million, give $3 million to the N.C.A.A. and still have enough left over to cover costs.''\nBecause it does not have a contractual agreement with any conference, the Fiesta Bowl was able to raise the ante and lure No. 1 Miami and No. 2 Penn State - independent teams -to Tempe, Ariz., this year. The Fiesta Bowl is a relative newcomer - this is the 16th game - but it has risen quickly in prestige because of its Sunbelt setting and financial clout. Backed by Sunkist, the Fiesta Bowl, which paid Arizona State and Florida State $168,237 in the inaugural game in 1971, is rewarding Miami and Penn State with $2.4 million each this year.\nThe game was moved to New Year's Day in 1982. To take advantage of this year's matchup for No. 1, the Fiesta Bowl was moved to Jan. 2 and given a prime-time kickoff in the East by NBC.\n''We think we've been right on merit on all the moves we've made,'' Meyers said. ''From the start, our goal has been to do something innovative. We feel this is what the N.C.A.A. should be doing. We're urging them to get into the 20th century. But if they remain as inflexible as they have in the past, then our plan will not be approved.''

Wilson Goode and the Olde Citie Fife and Drum Corps, marched from Independence Hall, where the Constitution was signed on Sept. 17, 1787, to Penn's Landing, along the Delaware River and next to the Ben Franklin Bridge.
321	A Philippine Issue Tops Winners List	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DA1E3EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Winning issues on the American Stock Exchange consisted of a potpourri of industries, ranging from a fake-fingernail manufacturer, a film distributor and a home-furnishings company to a politically propelled issue, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company.\nWinning issues on the American Stock Exchange consisted of a potpourri of industries, ranging from a fake-fingernail manufacturer, a film distributor and a home-furnishings company to a politically propelled issue, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company.\nOn the other hand, the list of big Amex losers was dominated by energy companies squeezed in the vise of oil-price weakness.\nThe Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, the principal supplier of local and long distance telephone service in the Philippines, was by far the Amex's biggest percentage gainer as it nearly sextupled in price in the year, to close at $12.75. San Carlos Milling, another Philippine issue, also carved out a substantial percentage gain while ending in the 21st spot. Effect of U.S. Backing Cited\n''The spectacular rise in these two stocks was unquestionably due to the strong political support in the United States for the new Aquino Government,'' said Thomas H. Dinsmore, president of the Bancroft Convertible Fund, a closed-end, Amex mutual fund that has closely tracked Philippine-rooted equities. He said these stocks had lanquished under the regime of President Ferdinand Marcos.\nThe other leading gainers on the Amex winners' list benefited from factors as varied as their businesses, including higher earnings, acquisition activity and new shopping trends.\nAnalysts said the precipitous collapse of oil and gas prices in the first half of the year adversely affected many smaller exploration, production and service companies.\n''Highly leveraged balance sheets continued to make matters even worse,'' said Barry Sahgal, oil analyst at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. ''The recent flurry in petroleum prices will most likely be a painfully deceptive mirage for many players in this industry.'' 'Financial Darwinism' Expected\nHe said the future of the oil industry will probably be ''an exercise in financial Darwinism, with survival of the fittest being assured.''\nHardest hit from an equity-depreciation standpoint was Houston-based Convest Energy Partners, a limited partnership stemming from the mid-1985 exchange offer for interests in oil and gas drilling and income and limited partnerships previously set up by the Convest Energy Corporation.\nIn July of last year, Convest Energy suspended quarterly cash dividends in the wake of the sharp decline in oil and gas prices.\nThe second-biggest Amex loser was the Dallas-based NRM Energy Company, sole general partner of the Natural Resources Management Corporation. The partnership recently agreed to acquire $83.5 million of oil and gas assets from Mesa Limited Partnership for 35 to 40 percent of NRM's outstanding depository units. #1986 Expansions Last year saw the Amex name Kenneth R. Leibler as its 22d president, offer a new institutional index option, open a European office and begin expanding its trading floor.\nFor the year the Amex market value index rose 17.14 points, or 6.96 percent, to 263.27, from 246.13 on Dec. 31, 1985.\nAs a financial marketplace, the American Stock Exchange said it had accomplished the following in 1986:\n* Registered its highest yearly share volume in history by Sept. 4, surpassing the annual record of 2.1 billion set in 1985.\n* Set a record in total options volume for the the 11th straight year.\n* Recorded the highest number of new listings since 1972.\nIt also posted its highest net income in history, with profitability of $8.5 billion in the first 10 months.\nWALL STREET IN 1986

The 7.4 percent gain was far outdistanced by the 22.6 percent rise for the year posted by the Dow Jones industrial average, an indicator based on 30 blue-chip stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe gain measured by the over-the-counter index also failed to approach the 13.98 percent increase in the broad-based New York Stock Exchange composite index during 1986. More Issues Traded\nAt year-end, the aggregate market value of the Nasdaq common stocks stood at a record $343 billion, up from $285 billion at the end of 1985 -thanks in part to the addition of nearly 400 stocks, bringing the total of issues traded to 5,071.\nGordon S. Macklin, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, said that the Nasdaq index's gains came from strong performances in such sectors as pharmaceuticals, utilities and finance, and from the services sector, which benefited from lower interest rates and low inflation.\nAnalysts depicted the general over-the-counter market as being in a lull. ''Over-the-counter stocks haven't done anything to speak of since last summer,'' said William M. LeFevre, senior vice president at Advest Group Inc. ''I don't see this market topping out without a rally in the Nasdaq.''\nAmong all Nasdaq stock groups, the biggest gainer was the 102-company pharmaceutical and biotechnology group, which was up 55 percent. It was followed closely by apparel companies, which rose 51 percent. Gold and silver issues gained 31 percent for the year.\nRounding out the top five groups were electric, gas and sanitary services - which were up 23 percent -and trucking and transportation companies, with an 18 percent rise. Banks Fare Poorly\nCommercial banks, particularly in the Southwest, posted the biggest decline with a 28 percent drop. They were followed by electronic components, which fell 24 percent. Oil and gas companies dropped 23 percent, and communications equipment companies and construction concerns declined 17 percent and 11 percent, respectively.\nAmong the top gaining Nasdaq issues, there seemed to be little in common. They included a mining company, a slot machine maker and a producer of lawn-care equipment.\nThe top gainer was Digitech Inc., an electronic equipment manufacturer in St. Louis. The company has been reporting improved earnings and had a gain on the sale of discontinued operations. For the year, its stock jumped 776 percent, to $5.75.\nThe biggest loser was the Spectran Corporation of Sturbridge, Mass., which makes flexible glass fibers for the communications industry. The company posted a loss because of a $2.1 million inventory write-down. Spectran's stock fell 90.1 percent for the year, to $2.125.\nThe list of the top 10 losers included financial institutions that suffered from huge loan losses. Among them were banks in Alaska and Oklahoma, where declining crude oil prices have severely damaged local economies.

The woman, who was not identified by the police, was said to be uninjured.\nThe police said the man was later stopped from entering by employees who reported that he was carrying a pistol. He left the bar, then came back minutes later with a .233-caliber rifle and shot through the front doors, Officer John Bacot said.

Season of Controversy\nAt the end of another season of nationwide controversy involving accusations of academic abuses, outcries for reforms, the introduction of drug-testing for bowl-game participants and instances of misconduct by players, the Canes and Lions will meet in the desert dusk, surrounded by a sellout crowd at 70,021-seat Sun Devil Stadium in nearby Tempe.\nA prime-time audience for the national telecast on NBC, with the kickoff scheduled for 8:15 P.M. Eastern standard time, could grow as large as 70 million. And that audience will expect to see the determination of a championship of the nation's major colleges, and presumably - with the introduction of testing for 84 banned or restricted substances - of the drug-free football world.\nBeneath the emotional frenzy, which has contributed to name-calling, charges and denials this week, can be found the essence of this Fiesta Bowl, a 16-year-old event that did not exist when the outstanding Penn State teams of the late 1960's were omitted from the top of the news-agency polls. Bad Memories\nThe matchup of two unbeaten independents, who could come together because they were not bound by agreements that send conference champions to specific games, provides a rare opportunity for two experienced, balanced and extraordinarily talented teams to erase the memory of humiliations they suffered simultaneously last New Year's night.\nPenn State, which was ranked No. 1 going into the Orange Bowl, committed uncharacteristic breakdowns in a 25-10 loss to Oklahoma. John Shaffer, the unspectacular but nearly always efficient quarterback, threw three interceptions that contributed to the undoing of a defensive effort that had created serious problems for the Sooners.\n''We walked off that field feeling we were better physically than Oklahoma,'' said Joe Paterno, the Penn State coach. ''We didn't play well. We kicked the ball around. We felt there were a couple of points when we had Oklahoma hanging on. I think that game has had a tremendous bearing on the attitude of this squad.''\nThe nature of the loss turned the 1986 season into a continuation of the process. And while Miami's experience at the Sugar Bowl was more shocking, the 35-7 loss to Tennessee that ended any Miami hope of a top ranking last year led to a determined approach to the season that ends Friday evening.

Most of all, I think, I feel gratitude to Matilda, my partner, my friend and my wife, to all of our children, to our family, especially our parents. I feel gratitude to all of you here whose faces I recognize so well, who have supported us and encouraged us. Especially those of you who were with us in the very early days when my obvious limitations and imperfections made it so unlikely that I would ever succeed in public life.\nI feel gratitude to the hard-working men and women on my staff and in my cabinet and in all of the agencies of state government, and in the Legislature, because it was all of them who, working together in the past four years, created a record of achievement that helped earn us what is, I think it's fair to say, an extraordinary electoral victory.\nI feel especially grateful to a wonderful public servant who we're going to miss a great deal, Stanley Fink, who came into government to make life better for the people he served and in his extraordinary career, he elevated the politics of New York. We will miss him, Stanley Fink.\nI'm grateful to a kind providence that bestows blessings with a generosity that goes far beyond anything we could earn.\nAnd in a very special way, I feel gratitude to the Empire State and to this amazing place of miracles called America. Miracle is, I think, not too grand a word for the magnificent idea of democracy and its blueprint, the United States Constitution, whose 200th birthday we'll be celebrating this year. Circle of Opportunity Opening Ever Wider We began with 13 diverse and often quarrelsome colonies, native peoples with their own separate and powerful cultures, a vast land, most of it wilderness. And from these things we created a country that now reaches from ocean to great ocean and beyond, the freest, the most powerful nation in the entire world. For 200 years this nation has met challenge after challenge. For 200 years it has grown and prospered, realizing more and more of the daring promises of the Declaration of Independence, whose promise is embodied by our Statue of Liberty. Opening ever wider the circle of opportunity, first to the colonists, then to the pioneers and then to the immigrants from all over the world.\nNo, miracle is not too grand a word for America's success in providing sustenance and opportunity for the people of 10 generations, many of whom, were it not for this place, would have lived whole lives without any hope at all.\nAnd my administration has been built on that belief, that the miracle is not over, built on the belief that New York is still a place of hope and opportunity for those who are willing to join the unique American experiment in democracy.\nNow I talked about that belief four years ago when I stood on this platform for the first time. I talked about progressive pragmatism and the idea of family. I talked about the dangers of Social Darwinism, about Rabbi Hillel and Pope John XXIII and Mama and Papa and Ellis Island. I said then all of the things that were on my mind and in my heart. And some approved of the words that I used but said that four years of actual governance would show them to be unrealistic, perhaps just poetry. Improving Lives In Tangible Ways But now, four years later, having applied those ideas to the task of serving this wonderful state of nearly 18 million people, I believe it all, even more assuredly and passionately than I did then. For nearly 1,500 days, we struggled to make our inaugural rhetoric everyday reality. And now we can look back and see how our beliefs have worked to improve the lives of the people of this state in tangible ways.\nIn 1983, we promised jobs. Now over 900,000 more New Yorkers are at work. In 1983, we reminded people that part of what makes this miracle work is our reverence for the rule of law, which gives us the order and stability that in parts of this world are imposed with tanks and bayonets and secret police. And since then we have restored and strengthened every part of our criminal-justice system. In 1983, we committed ourselves in a special way to the middle class and the working people of this state - those people who were struggling to pay their taxes, meet their mortgage or their rent payments, educate their children.\nWe've kept that commitment. We enacted the largest tax cut in our history, removed from the rolls altogether 500,000 New Yorkers who work but are still poor. We provided thousands of hard-working families, families not poor enough to be on welfare, but not rich enough to be worry-free, we provided them with an opportunity they would not have had without this government's help, the chance to own their own homes.\nWe made massive new investments in the public schools that have given opportunities to our children for nearly 200 years. And still, we balanced our budget more rigorously than ever before. And in the process, we did not forget the most vulnerable of us. A Government With Heart and Head I said four years ago from this platform that a society as blessed as this one should be able to find room for all at the table: shelter for the homeless, care for the elderly and infirm and hope for the destitute. And those words became laws. We adopted strong nutrition programs and the most ambitious program for the homeless in the United States. We helped relieve the burdens of families who were caring for retarded children. We increased shelter allowances and gave new opportunities for work to New Yorkers who were on welfare.\nI could go on with this list of accomplishment, but this list is no personal boast. These are not my achievements. They were produced by a government led by Democrats and Republicans, by upstaters and downstaters, by men and women, by blacks and whites from every part of this state. People of every color, people of every creed, representing all of us together. And we proved - together - that the New York idea works, that government can have both a heart and a head, that it can have both common sense and compassion.\nWe proved that we can balance our books without ignoring the reasonable needs of the struggling middle class and poor. Most of all, I think, by our performance we made one point over and over again. We have shown that we are at our very best as a people when we recognize one single basic truth, and it is not always easy to live with. And the truth is that we are all of us connected one to another. We are all of us truly brothers and sisters in one family. That no man is an island, that no woman, no neighborhood, no village, no state, no nation either. That we touch one another, that we need one another. And so we should work together and hope together and love together for the good of all of us. That's the essence of the New York idea. Still Much More To Do in State Now I believe it is right and good to remind ourselves of our achievements at this moment, if only to remind ourselves what we are capable of as a society if we do indeed work together. And we need to be reminded because it would be wrong to let this moment's rejoicing obscure the fact that we still have much to do in this state. We have more people at work than ever before, but still too many of our people are denied the chance to earn their own bread.\nThere are single parents desperate for the day care that will allow them to work in order to provide for their families. There are families and individuals who live in dread of a hospital bill that will deny them the little security they've managed to put aside with a whole lifetime's sweat. There are families anguished by their inability to take care of aging loved ones who are no longer able to take care of themselves.\nAnd there appear to be more homeless than ever before, despite all of our efforts. There are thousands of children having children. Thousands more ravished by drugs. Some so desperate that they take their own lives.\nFaced with these hard facts, we as a people have a number of choices. Those of us who are comfortable can choose to pretend that the problems do not exist. We can look around at the unemployed steelworkers and the other thousands denied the chance to work. At the hard-pressed middle class. Daring to Be Bolder and Wiser We can look at the homeless huddled in doorways, at children barely in their teens who turn to drugs or parenthood as an antidote to despair. We can see more and more elderly living in fear of destitution and abandonment. We can hear the eloquent cries of America's religious leaders, including the Catholic bishops most recently, on behalf of the voiceless poor. And we can dismiss it all on the assumption that the price of comfort for most of us is that government must ignore the rest of us.\nOr we can say, as we're being urged to by some in Washington, that we have stretched our minds and our wills and our resources as far as they will go. That for all government has tried to do over the last several decades we have only been losing ground, that we now have to settle for less than we once believed we were capable of, less than was done by our forebears who lifted an entire generation from poverty, defeated Fascism and built this country into the strongest nation in the world.\nAnd we have another choice. We can aim higher. We can try to do more with this wonderful opportunity. We can dare to be bolder and wiser. We can recall that since Franklin Roosevelt lifted himself from his wheelchair to lift this nation from its knees, until just a few years ago, America found the strength and the intelligence to help millions of people rise from poverty to the middle class and far beyond. Your grandparents, perhaps your parents, certainly mine.\nAnd in a more modest way we can be encouraged by our own last four years of progress together, all of us working together. Producing a record of balanced budgets without forgetting that the first purpose of government in New York is to improve the conditions of people's lives. The Future Is Not Beyond Our Control Ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe that our future is beyond our control. I do not believe that this great state, or this great land, has been exhausted in the process of helping earlier generations or that we must resign ourselves to a future of lower expectations. I do not believe that the miracle is over and that the circle of opportunity has closed.\nNow, make no mistake about it -the path I would suggest is a hard one, actually the hardest. It would be easier to surrender to lower expectations or to give in to the temptation of reckless expenditure as others have. Both of those paths are relatively easy to take. Making the miracle work requires our greatest skill and courage. It requires that we continue the economic resurgence that provides our state with the wealth we need to prepare for our future and to cope with our present.\nAnd to do that we must contain our expenditures and the taxes that support those expenditures. We'll have to have the intelligence to continue to avoid the kind of foolish mismanagement of resources and profligate spending that has left the Federal Government with a punishing $200 billion budget deficit and debtor status in the world of international trade.\nHere in New York, to pursue the path I suggest, we'll have to have the will to say no to some of the things we want so that we will have the capacity to say yes to the things we really need.\nAnd all the time that we do these things we must keep in mind that nicely balanced budgets which ignore the need to educate our children or to care for the mentally ill or to keep strong our criminal-justice system would be the emblem of failure and hypocrisy. Immense Satisfaction And Encouragement Now this is a hard challenge indeed. Doing it all at the same time with balance and fairness will require the very best of all of us. And we'll not do it perfectly in any event. There will be failures. There will be disappointments along the way.\nBut in the four years that ended yesterday, we proved that working together over time we can meet that challenge. And that should be a matter, I think, of immense satisfaction for us and great encouragement. It certainly is to me. I am not afraid of the days ahead.\nI believe, from what I have seen and learned about this state and its people and its governance, that we're strong enough and wise enough to reach higher ground than ever before. And I believe that we will. I see our economy growing, not shrinking. Spurred by lower taxes and our state's vast capacity for high technology, improved by fiber optics in ways that will link our computers and our communications systems and our businesses, our growth assisted by the new opportunity zones, new forms of collaboration between management and labor, new forms of worker participation, billions of dollars in pension funds to be used for capital.\nI see more jobs. Good jobs for all the people who can work. I see less need for welfare in our future. I see a future where our children - the children of this state - and our young people will get a better start in life than anywhere on this planet. I see our air and water cleaner and safer, our natural beauty preserved with the help of the Superfund and the bond issue we were fortunate enough to have passed last year.\nI see a new emphasis on the basic values that over the years made sweet and strong the soul of the American people at their very best. Values like honesty, courage, responsibility, dignity, a concern for one another, tolerance and understanding and love and, yes, a sense of family. I see leaders of all political persuasions who have the wisdom and courage to compromise when compromise is in order, and the strength to stand up when principle demands it.\nI see a new era of accountability ushering in a new era of opportunity. I see a future with all the government we need, but only the government we need. A Vision as Real As the Statue of Liberty I saw it four years ago. And today, as I've said, I see it even more clearly. Together, you and I and all of us in New York have the ability to make the Constitution's third century -and Lady Liberty's second - our greatest ever, with a better, freer, more prosperous, more just society. Now that vision is as real to me as the sight of Liberty Island and our magnificent Lady Liberty.\nAnd that fight has been real to me for half a century. I remember it from my childhood in South Jamaica, Queens. I remember having visited the statue and I remember, later, on hot afternoons after supper my friends and I would go up to the tar roofs of the tenements and the apartments where we lived on 150th Street. And we'd stand on the tar roof, still hot from the summer sun, lean against the low walls and look west toward the horizon and the faraway towers of Manhattan. And if we turned our eyes just a little toward the great harbor, we could imagine Lady Liberty holding up her lamp like an evening star.\nNew York State, a place of miracles; the Lady Liberty, beckoning us to opportunity. Together, New York and the Lady allowed us to dream all that might be. Even now, if I try, I can remember. I can see the torch, the star in the distance. I can feel the aching to belong. I can see my father, again weary from another long day's labor, his arms folded, his shirt stained with sweat, watching us as we looked out to where the Lady stood. His tired, hopeful eyes telling us, go on, make your wish. Offering his silent prayer for his children. I can bring it all back. A Lamp Lifted For the Millions And then I have my own silent plea. Lift your lamp, Lady. Lift it to those you've always welcomed. To the lonely and the friendless, to all the members of the human family the world so often finds it convenient to ignore, to despise, even to persecute. Lift it for our brothers and sisters in this country, for the farm families and factory workers who are fighting to hold on to their farms and their jobs and their dignity. For the parents struggling to give their children more than they had - more education, more opportunity, more hope. For the children, the children especially. The children everywhere who are lost and confused, adrift, without values, without guidance. Lift your lamp, Lady, for the millions among us who are without work or enough to eat or even a roof overhead.\nAnd lift your lamp, as well, for the fortunate among us. For the well fed, for the well educated, for the satisfied. Don't let us forget who we are and where we came from and what your promise has pledged us to. Remind us always, as you lift your lamp beside the golden door. Make us remember the beauty, the wonder of this place of miracles made for sharing. Write it in our hearts, Lady.\nNo, ladies and gentlemen, the miracle is not over.
327	AFGHANISTAN TO OBSERVE A CEASE-FIRE	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D71E3EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Afghanistan's Soviet-backed Government announced today that starting Jan. 15 its forces would observe a cease-fire in their battle with Moslem guerrillas.\nAfghanistan's Soviet-backed Government announced today that starting Jan. 15 its forces would observe a cease-fire in their battle with Moslem guerrillas.\nNajibullah, the Afghan leader, described the move as a step toward national reconciliation in the seven-year-old war, the Kabul radio reported.\nBut the first reaction from guerrilla leaders appeared to be negative.\nAccording to Reuters, a spokesman in Islamabad, Pakistan, for the seven guerrilla groups known as the Mujahedeen said they had rejected Mr. Najibullah's move.\nAccording to reports today by the Kabul radio and the Soviet press agency Tass, Mr. Najibullah disclosed the cease-fire on Tuesday in a speech to the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party of Afghanistan. He was reported to have said the cease-fire would be temporary but could be extended if rebel groups honored it and reconciliation began. Warns Against Attacks\n''National reconciliation begins with a cease-fire,'' the radio quoted Mr. Najibullah as having said. ''At the national level, the cease-fire will be effective from Jan. 15.''\nHe warned, however, that ''if someone continues to fire, he will get the response that will be satisfactory.''\nThe cease-fire would be followed, he said, by a discussion with the opposition groups, including exiled leaders of the former monarchy.\n''We don't want to exclude different political groups, moderates, monarchists and heads of armed anti-Government bands active abroad, from national reconciliation,'' Mr. Najibullah said. ''I have spoken before about the creation of a coalition government of national unity.''\nNo further details on the cease-fire were provided by the Kabul radio or by the Tass report. The Kabul broadcast was monitored by United States Government listening posts, translated and transmitted to Washington. State Department Doubtful\nState Department officials said that as far as they knew, the announcement had not been preceded by any discussions between the Afghan Government and the guerrilla groups. Because of this, they said they doubted the cease-fire would win guerrilla backing. There was no official comment in Washington pending the return of senior officials from the New Year's holiday.\nThe analysts said the cease-fire was consistent with the Soviet effort over the last year to widen the political base of the Afghan leadership and to put the onus on the guerrillas for the continued fighting. About 120,000 Soviet troops are stationed in Afghanistan.\nIn December 1985, Pravda, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper, called for including genuine opposition figures in a national reconciliation government. This theme has been repeated by Soviet and Afghan spokesmen since then.\nIn addition, the Soviet side has given signs of being concerned about the negative effect of the drawn-out guerrilla war on its own population and on Soviet standing in Moslem countries. A token withdrawal of about 8,000 troops was undertaken last October and was given wide publicity in the Soviet Union to suggest that Moscow was eager to end its involvement once the proper conditions were met. Took Over in May\nMr. Najibullah, a former secret police chief, took over control in May after the Soviet Union forced Babrak Karmal to step down as party leader. He has repeatedly called for a reconciliation government.\nIn November Mr. Karmal was forced to give up his remaining Government and party posts, increasing Mr. Najibullah's power, although experts contend that there remain serious differences within the Kabul leadership.\nLast month Mr. Najibullah and almost all the key members of his leadership spent several days in Moscow meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, and other high officials, apparently to plot strategy for coming months. The Soviet leaders were believed by American political analysts to have called for an end to divisions in the leadership and for a more credible effort to persuade some opposition figures to join the Government.\nNegotiations to try to end the war have been held under United Nations auspices between Pakistan and the Afghan Government. Those talks will resume in Geneva on Feb. 11, with the main unresolved issue being a timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet forces. The Soviet Union has offered in the past to leave within four years, but the Pakistanis and Americans want a withdrawal in three to four months.
328	The Bonz Is Ticking	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD61E3EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The folks out here at the Fiesta Bowl thought they were smart, moving back their game from New Year's Day to tonight, so they could put on the Miami-Penn State game and decide the unofficial national championship during prime time.\nThe folks out here at the Fiesta Bowl thought they were smart, moving back their game from New Year's Day to tonight, so they could put on the Miami-Penn State game and decide the unofficial national championship during prime time.\nBut action begets reaction, and at the last minute, the Tumbleweed Bowl between Sunbelt State and Rustbelt Tech was shifted to next Monday night.\nThe Tumbleweed Bowl followed the trend and sought corporate sponsorship, but the marketplace was a little slow, so they had to divide the shares.\nFor this year only, the game is officially known as the Convenient Mart/Roach Ridder/Bicarbonate of Soda Tumbleweed Bowl. But on the theory that sports events should not become animated sandwich boards (What's next - the Piggly Wiggly Super Bowl?), we'll stick with pure, simple Tumbleweed Bowl.\nThe shift gave the Tumbleweed Bowl the temporary title of latest bowl game ever, and opened up an audience of all the numb souls who go looking for Monday Night Football, not knowing the regular professional season is over.\nEarly yesterday morning, I got a tip there was trouble at the Tumbleweed Bowl involving the star attraction, Bonzo Sweeney, the fullback from Rustbelt Tech.\nBonzo had become popular not just because he could carry the football with four or five tacklers hanging all over him, but because he stuck pink safety pins in his ears, dyed his hair chartreuse and pushed grapefruits into the lenses of hand-held mini-cameras.\nA production company had made a video of Bonzo singing, ''The Best of Sid Vicious,'' with proceeds going to Bonzo's favorite charity, Fund for the Friends of Boy George.\nIf Bonzo was out of the game, the Tumbleweed Bowl would be in deep trouble. I put in a call to the sports information director at Sunbelt State, an old newspaper buddy of mine. ''What's doing?'' I asked. ''The Feds have locked up Bonzo,'' my man said. ''Look, I know I should be happy that big lug is out of their lineup, but he was our best shot at a high rating. And that's what these bowl games are all about.'' ''I understand that,'' I said, ''but why in the world is a star fullback being held by the Feds?''\n''It's a long story,'' my friend said. ''But let me tell you, this college sports business is so complicated, I almost wish I was back as a news reporter, covering car wrecks and bank robberies and simple stuff like that. Remember when those strip miners pulled pistols on us back in eastern Kentucky?''\n''Those were the good old days,'' I agreed. ''But getting back to college sports, what's happening with Bonzo?'' ''Y ou can't quote me on any of this,'' my pal said.\n''But let me give you a little background. It all started when the Fiesta Bowl moved into the New Year's picture a few years back. Nothing wrong with that, is there?''\n''Free enterprise system,'' I said, remembering my high-school civics.\n''Darn right. Then this year it just happened that the two best records in the country belonged to two independent teams who were not tied down to any other bowl game. The Fiesta Bowl people, the NBC people and the Miami and Penn State people moved the game to Friday night in prime time.''\n''It meant nobody had any excuse to watch a single minute of football on New Year's Day,'' I said. ''We could all start the year getting healthy out of doors, and wait for the Fiesta Bowl.''\n''But why stop there?'' my friend asked. ''The Tumbleweed Bowl folks wanted to know why they couldn't hold a bowl game next Monday night?''\n''But who would care?'' I asked. ''That game would have no meaning after the Fiesta Bowl.''\n''But suppose something, uh, happened?'' my friend asked. ''Happened?'' ''Look, this year the N.C.A.A. put in drug testing for every bowl game. A few players who tested positive all had logical explanations that they had taken medicine for a virus, or had taken steroids after an injury, all on the advice of personal physicians. Given the side-effects from steroids, I can't imagine most physicians prescribing them. They had to sit out the game just the same.''\n''But those bowl games didn't mean anything,'' I said. ''And all the Fiesta Bowl players have tested clean.''\n''That was the chance we were taking,'' my friend said. ''But suppose enough players were disqualified that Sunbelt State and Rustbelt Tech looked like better teams by Monday night? Or supposing Penn State and Miami got into a brawl during a steak fry and couldn't take the field?''\n''Oh, that was just some gamesmanship on the part of Miami,'' I said.\n''We were willing to take the chance,'' my friend said. ''And in the meantime, we had Bonzo, the punk-rock rocker himself, on prime time.''\n''What happened to Bonzo?'' I asked. ''B onzo passed the drug test and the steroid test, no problem,'' my friend said. ''He figured he was home free, and decided to bulk himself up a little more for the professional draft. So he started taking iron pills.'' ''Iron pills?'' ''Hundreds of them,'' my friend said gloomily. ''The clod couldn't wait till he got to the Tumbleweed Bowl. He gulped 'em down before getting on the team bus to the airport. When Bonzo tried to walk through the electronic screening device, every siren in the airport went off. The guards ordered him into a side room to be frisked.'' ''That shouldn't have been a problem,'' I said. ''Bonzo is ticklish,'' my friend groaned. ''Anything less physical than a forearm to his frontal lobe makes him crazy. When the guards frisked him, he started laughing and throwing himself around on the floor. He injured three inspectors and destroyed the room before they could get a straitjacket on him. The Feds charged him with resisting arrest and the judge won't even grant him bail until Tuesday.'' ''Why Tuesday?'' ''The judge is a Notre Dame graduate,'' my friend said. ''He doesn't follow college sports any more, and he thinks the Irish still have a shot at being number one.''

329	LANDETA DOWNPLAYS PUNT THAT MISSED	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED61E3EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Sean Landeta reflected today on his unusual year.\nSean Landeta reflected today on his unusual year.\n''I think it's been the best year of my life,'' said the Giants' punter. ''It started out as the worst.''\nThe bad started on last New Year's Day when the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs said it was investigating a complaint by a fan who accused Landeta of scalping playoff tickets. The investigators subsequently found Landeta innocent.\nOn Jan. 5 came an incident that Landeta refers to sarcastically as ''my good luck in the playoffs.'' When he punted from the end zone in a heavy wind, he barely ticked the ball. Shaun Gayle of the Chicago Bears picked it up and ran 5 yards for the touchdown that started the Bears toward a 21-0 victory. Two games later, the Bears won Super Bowl XX.\n''The next day,'' said Landeta, ''was my 24th birthday. I woke up and saw my picture in every newspaper in America screwing up. It was a nice birthday present. Then I got reminded of it 10 times a day for the next three months. So the year didn't start nice.'' Punting Figures Impressive\nIt certainly became nicer. In his second National Football League regular season, which ended two weeks ago, Landeta finished second in gross punting yardage (44.8-yard average to 45.2 for Rohn Stark of the Indianapolis Colts). He finished third in net yardage (37.1 yards to 37.4 for Reggie Roby of the Miami Dolphins and 37.2 for Stark). His steady punting has won him a trip to the Pro Bowl.\nFirst, however, there is more work to do for the Giants. They play the San Francisco 49ers here Sunday in a divisional playoff game. If they win, they play here the following Sunday for the conference championship. If they win that, it's on to Pasadena, Calif., for Super Bowl XXI.\nIf all that happens, said Landeta, maybe people will forget the punt that never, or hardly, was. Maybe they will accept him for the good things he has done.\nProbably not. Landeta said punters usually attracted attention only when something went wrong, ''as I unfortunately found out.'' So he said he had gone through endless conversations like this:\nQ. ''What happened on that punt?'' A. ''What everybody saw.'' Q. ''You missed the punt.''\nA. ''Did you watch the game? What did you see.''\nQ. ''It looked like the wind took the ball out of your hands.'' A. ''You answered your question.'' Got Part of the Ball ''When I punted,'' said Landeta, ''I didn't see the ball come off the foot and go up. I didn't feel any explosion. So I knew I didn't get it. Unfortunately, I got a little of it. If I missed it completely, maybe it would have fallen in front of me and maybe I could have fallen on it on the 2- or 3-yard line. And maybe we could have held them to 3 points.\n''But I was still in my follow through and the guy on the Bears was picking it up. I thought, 'This is unreal. How could this happen?' ''\nBut it did happen. When Landeta went to the sideline, Bill Parcells, the Giants' coach, asked what happened. Landeta said the wind had taken the ball and he had barely touched it.\n''He didn't say a word,'' said Landeta. ''He didn't frown. Nothing. Nobody on the bench said anything except, 'What happened?' Nobody told me not to worry. Nobody consoled me. I didn't feel anything.\n''I thought about it for 30 seconds and then forgot it because I knew I had to get back in the game. I punted eight times after that.\n''It was a crazy thing that happened. People still ask about it. I'm sure if I did something as good as that was bad, I wouldn't get half the publicity.'' Strictly Negative\nEvery negative story usually has a positive side. Landeta said this one did not.\n''There's nothing good about messing up,'' he said. ''It ended up being a good year. And it's not over yet.''\nNeither is the memory of the punt that wasn't. The memory comes up at strange times. For example, four months after that Bears game, there was a golfing foursome of Parcells; Ron Erhardt, the Giants' offensive coordinator; Mike Pope, the tight-end coach, and Mickey Corcoran, Parcells's high school basketball coach and mentor.\nThey were on the 16th tee, and all day there had been no talk of football, only golf. Erhardt addressed his ball. He started his backswing. Suddenly, he stopped. Then he turned to the others. He mentioned no names, no teams, no dates. He had just one question.\n''How the hell did he miss that punt?'' said Erhardt.

Kosar is ready for that event, just as he is for Friday night's Sunkist Fiesta Bowl game between Miami - his school - and Penn State.\n''I'll be rooting for the old alma mater,'' said Kosar, who could have been playing in that game rather than in a National Football League playoff except for circumstances that he brought about.\nBy the time the Hurricanes or the Nittany Lions kick off, Kosar will have concluded a week-long film study of ''five or six'' Jet games involving about 12 hours of concentration. Jets Called Versatile\n''When you play a team that does a lot of different things, like they do, you have to put in a lot more time,'' he said in an interview here, where the Browns worked out this week.\nThe Jets will not get in the way of the Fiesta Bowl game, however. ''If you don't know it by Friday, you'll never know it,'' said Kosar.\nKosar turned 23 years old on Nov. 25. He passed up two remaining seasons of college eligibility to join the Browns in 1985. If he had remained in college, he would have been Miami's quarterback rather than Vinny Testaverde.\n''I've never regretted the decision to be here,'' said Kosar as he stuffed shoes into an equipment bag. ''Not for a minute.''\nBy taking up to 20 course-hours a semester plus summer classes, he earned a degree in finance and economics in two and one-half years, thereby becoming eligible for an N.F.L. supplemental draft in June 1985.\n''You go to college to get an education, to get a degree,'' he said. ''You can't play football for very long.''\nKosar and the Browns' offense matured together this season. ''There wasn't much there to begin with,'' according to Gary Danielson, the team's veteran backup quarterback. Started From Scratch\nLindy Infante was the new offensive coordinator and the often-injured Danielson was to be the starter, with Kosar having another incubation season. The offensive unit was young and only Mike Baab, a center, Ozzie Newsome, a tight end, and Cody Risien, a tackle, had been regulars for more than one season.\n''For this team to be where it's at now, to have won 12 games,'' said Danielson, ''everything had to come together. And it did, week by week.\n''They gave Bernie more and more, and now he can make every kind of play there is. The last few games this is the best offense I've seen, and I've been around awhile.''\nDanielson, an N.F.L. quarterback since 1976, compares Kosar's qualities to those of San Diego's Dan Fouts. ''Both are fiesty and tough,'' he said.\nHow much better was he in December than in September? ''I don't think of myself individually,'' he said. ''I think of the whole offense, and it's 100 percent better.'' Statistics Are Good\nKosar, 6 feet 5 inches and 210 pounds, ranked seventh among N.F.L. passers according to the ratings formula. But the ratio most coaches value, touchdowns to interceptions, was a good 17 to 10 and his percentage of interceptions, 1.9, was the league's lowest, a tribute to a quarterback in his first full season as a regular.\nLike many good passers, Kosar can throw the football in any motion, overhand to underhand or by snap of the wrist. He appreciates this. ''I have the ability to get rid of the ball in a crowd, in a jam,'' he said.\nIn the opinion of his coach, Marty Schottenheimer, Kosar has arrived. ''Bernie is able to run the offense,'' he said, ''to utilize the various things we have in trying to capitalize on what the defense may present. And there is a mental toughness about him that has helped him so much in his development.'' KOSAR AND GASTINEAU POISED FOR CLASH IN BROWNS-JETS GAME
333	RUGGED TASK AFTER INJURIES	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DE1F3EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In his most disappointing season, Mark Gastineau suddenly looms again as the Jet who must make the big play on defense.\nIn his most disappointing season, Mark Gastineau suddenly looms again as the Jet who must make the big play on defense.\nBud Carson, the defensive coordinator, explained today that he is relying on his line -not blitzing tactics - to pressure Bernie Kosar when the Jets face the Browns in Cleveland Saturday in a divisional playoff game.\nBecause Kosar is so good at finding the uncovered receiver quickly, the Jets probably cannot afford to send linebackers or defensive backs charging after him.\nThe last time the teams met in Cleveland, two years ago, Gastineau helped preserve a 24-20 victory with two sacks of Paul McDonald on the final Cleveland drive.\nLast year, facing Kosar for the first time, Gastineau was the American Football Conference player of the week in a playoff-clinching victory with a sack, six pressures, seven tackles and a forced fumble. Hobbled by Injuries\nIt has been some time since Gastineau was a force in a game. In an injury-plagued 1986 season, he produced only two sacks in 10 games. He was first troubled with a strained abdominal muscle, and then he missed the five final regular-season games because of arthroscopic knee surgery.\nIn Kosar, the Jets are facing a quarterback who has been dumped only seven times in his last five games, who has the best record in the league for avoiding interceptions, and who, simply, can get rid of the ball so quickly that defenders can't afford to blitz him.\nThat leaves the potential pressure up to the Jets' defensive line - especially Gastineau. No one else on the team is consistently dangerous in providing quarterback sacks or pressure.\nIn fact, Gastineau takes a ribbing from teammates over the fact that the leading sacker on the Jets right now happens to be Bobby Humphery, a defensive back converted from wide receiver. He had four during the season - 18 fewer than the record Gastineau established in 1984.\n''It's only my second game back, it's going to take me one more game,'' Gastineau said today, obviously expecting to get past the Browns and into the American Conference championship game.\nGastineau says he is over the abdominal-muscle strain that hindered his pass rush this year, and he said that the fact he is 20 pounds lighter has brought back his old quickness. Achieved Sack Against Chiefs\nHe returned from the surgery for last Sunday's wild-card game against the Chiefs and quickly produced a sack after Tom Baldwin helped collapse the protective quarterback pocket.\nDoes that one sack indicate that Gastineau can again pressure the quarterback?\n''The best thing for me is to keep my mouth shut, and after the Cleveland game we'll see,'' said Gastineau. ''I'm a firm believer in this team, and this could be the biggest letdown of my life if we don't win right now.''\nGastineau said he might change his rushing technique to overcome problems he had against the Chiefs.\nKansas City's left tackle, Irv Eatman, several times leveled the rushing Gastineau with blocks at knee level.\n''It's something he wouldn't have done unless he knew I was hurt,'' said Gastineau. ''They're going to go for my legs.'' To counter that, Gastineau said, ''you jump over him. I was a little bit hesitant because it was my first week back. Maybe this week I'll do it. It's normal to be hesitant after you've been in the hospital.'' KOSAR AND GASTINEAU POISED FOR CLASH IN BROWNS-JETS GAME
334	They Who 'Delivered' Boesky Are Perplexed	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DC1F3EF931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: One day late last summer, Gary G. Lynch, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division, snapped his fingers, turned briskly from the elevator bank on the fourth-floor of the commission's main building and strode down the hall with a distinct bounce in his step.\nOne day late last summer, Gary G. Lynch, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division, snapped his fingers, turned briskly from the elevator bank on the fourth-floor of the commission's main building and strode down the hall with a distinct bounce in his step.\n''We've got some big cases coming,'' the young, lanky lawyer said with a smile. ''We're going to look really good in a couple of months.''\nMr. Lynch's optimism was justified. His division had just broken the Dennis B. Levine $12.6 million insider trading case. Mr. Levine, a merger specialist now awaiting sentencing on four counts of illegal trading, was telling what he knew about other Wall Street operators. And those confessions had led the S.E.C. directly to Ivan F. Boesky, one of most flambuoyant and notoriously prescient stock speculators, who would be charged Nov. 14 with the largest insider trading scheme on record.\nIn settlement of the case against him, Mr. Boesky agreed to pay $100 million in fines and illegal profits for trading on confidential information on planned corporate mergers. In return, the Government agreed to bring only one felony charge against him.\nNow, six weeks after the Boesky case became public knowledge, Mr. Lynch's mood, and that of the enforcement division, is less than buouant. Emotions range from bitter to confused. The case that was expected to bring the highest accolades has brought with it a raw edge. Bittersweet Fruit\n''I don't understand,'' Mr. Lynch lamented recently. ''After the first week or two, everything began to turn negative. The press reports, the reactions from Congress. And here we had given them the most important insider trading case in our history. We had delivered Ivan Boesky.''\nMr. Lynch, who is in his 30's, was obviously tasting the bittersweet fruit of public service.\nThe Boesky case has indeed brought high praise to the S.E.C. from some of its most persistent critics, like John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Wall Streeters admit to being at least temporarily shellshocked and intimidated by the dozens of subpoenas issued by the commission's staff.\nTraders say rumor-mongering about possible takeover stocks has almost dried up. And, depending on how many other lawsuits against investment bankers, takeover lawyers and stock speculators come out of the Boesky investigation, the S.E.C. could exercise this new-found leverage over Wall Street for months to come.\nBut despite what many see as positive results, aspects of the Government's handling of the case remain a question mark in the minds of members of Congress, Wall Street lawyers and especially traders, who say they suffered huge losses when the stock market plunged in the wake of the Boesky disclosures.\nWhy, some ask, did the commission permit Mr. Boesky to sell stocks and close out other transactions totaling $1.4 billion to pay off large levels of debt before the settlement? Did the S.E.C. leave Mr. Boesky with some large store of hidden wealth? Was the agreement to charge him with only one felony count too lenient?\nSome are raising even larger questions about the ability of the commission to deter other similar illegal schemes over the long run. They cite concern that the commission's modest budgetary resources over the last few years (not much more than $100 million in the current fiscal year) have lagged far behind the growth in the markets, and they say that has sent a subtle signal to would-be lawbreakers that the chances of getting caught are very small.\nWilliam J. Anderson of the General Accounting Office testified before Congress last month that based on a preliminary analysis of surveillance systems at the S.E.C. and the New York Stock Exchange used to detect insider trading, ''if I wanted to devise a way to trade on insider information and not get detected, I could do it without too much trouble.''\nAnd, in a dramatic reversal, the commission chairman, John S. R. Shad, has agreed to ask for a substantial budget increase, in part to deal with the scope of the Boesky case.\n''These are all very valid questions to ask,'' said one prominent securities attorney. ''But the public won't be able to answer them until we see how many other cases come out of Boesky and know more facts.''\nCommission officials acknowledge that the continuing criticism is partly justified, because it has released far from enough information for the public to judge the wisdom of certain disputed elememts of the case.\n''We have basically come public with only a fraction of the story, and that leads to all kinds of speculation by the public,'' one top commission official said. ''But we're trapped - a Catch-22. If we reveal too much, we will definitely jeopardize future investigations related to the Boesky case. So we have to be big boys and take the heat.''\nPerhaps most responsible for the clamp-down on information is Mr. Lynch, who has repeatedly refused in interviews and before Congress to divulge more than what the commission included in its court papers. He has even declined to say how many commission lawyers are working on the case, when the Boesky investigation started or how many subpoenas the commission has issued for more information. ''We don't want to give anyone a sense of the dimension of the case,'' he said.\nThe cautious approach has surprised even his colleagues on occasion. Another top commission official was recently explaining the trading that Mr. Boesky was permitted before the announcement of his $100 million settlement with the commission. Interjecting himself into the conversation, Mr. Lynch told his colleague, ''I don't think we want to talk about any of that,'' and the colleague quickly closed his notebook.\nIn fact, Mr. Lynch was so concerned word of the Boesky investigation would leak out that, according to Congressional sources, he limited the number of commission officials with knowledge of the investigation's existence to 20 and limited the number of enforcement division lawyers on the case to only six.\n''I still think Gary might be playing this a little too close to his vest,'' said one commission official. ''The lack of information has permitted some big misrepresentations to get out to the public.''\nSome say these reputed misrepresentations (for example, the report, which the S.E.C. denies, that Mr. Boesky videotaped conversations with other investors) may have been deliberately floated by possible objects of S.E.C. investigations in an effort to force premature disclosures that might aid in their own defense.\n''I think there definitely are people out there in whose interest it is to make Mr. Boesky seem as bad as possible,'' said Harvey Pitt, one of Mr. Boesky's two lead lawyers. Compared to Hutton Case\nThe criticism over the Boesky case reminds some of that leveled against the Justice Department in 1985 for not indicting any individuals in its celebrated check-kiting case against E. F. Hutton.\nAlthough the Government got Hutton to plead guilty to 2,000 counts of mail and wire fraud, its unwillingness to indict any Hutton officials produced howls from Congress. Lawmakers said that by not naming individuals, the Government greatly reduced the deterrent effect of the case. Likewise, some argue that permitting Mr. Boesky to continue trading while under investigation or leaving him with substantial assets might not deter other violators.\n''I think this could be a case where a settlement between the Government and the defendant that seemed good for both sides turns out to be much costlier for both,'' one securities attorney said.\nAccording to some experts on S.E.C. operations, the commission simply may not have anticipated the public scrutiny the Boesky case would engender. ''There's no way they could have predicted the outcry from arbitrageurs who lost billions of dollars,'' said one trader.\nMary M. McCue, the commission's director of public affiars, says her office received hundreds of inquiries the first two weeks after the Boesky disclosures. After the initial flurry died down, she had buttons printed up for her modest staff that read ''We survived Boesky.'' WASHINGTON TALK: SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

''The danger of protectionism is greater now than at any time since the 1930's,'' Richard R. Burt, the United States Ambassador to West Germany, told an interviewer there recently. Precedence for Settlement\nIn the past, the European Community and Washington demonstrated an admirable record in defusing trade disputes, including recent conflicts over steel and steel products and foodstuffs such as wheat products and pasta.\nThe latest disputes, however, come about at a time when export markets for European goods are shrinking in the oil-producing countries of the Middle East and in debt-strapped developing areas. Meanwhile, a growing flow of Japanese goods has been deflected from North America to Europe.\nAll in all, the United States and Western Europe face an uphill struggle to avoid a major trade conflict this year.\nThe United States has threatened retaliatory duties on British gin, French brandy and white wines and Dutch cheeses, among other products. The duties will go into effect no later than Jan. 30, if Washington and the European Community cannot agree on compensation. GATT Talks Jeopardized\nThe trade issues are significant because they add to a logjam of unresolved questions that are delaying the start of a fresh round of international negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to liberalize and expand world trade.\nEuropean officials appear to believe that at least some of the Reagan Administration's sudden burst of activity is designed to blunt the edge of an aggressive Democratic-controlled Congress, which, Europeans fear, could restrict imports.\nThe United States duties announced this week came only days after West Germany and Switzerland were caught off guard by a United States measure to limit imports of machine tools. Though the restriction was aimed primarily at Japan and Taiwan, there was a symbolic significance to it that frightened the Germans and Swiss, who have been among the staunchest proponents of open trade. But the list of grievances is longer. Last month, the Reagan Administration said it would hold separate talks with France, West Germany and Britain om a complaint that they are pledging excessive subsidies to new versions of the Airbus, the jointly built European civilian aircraft that competes increasingly with American aircraft of the Boeing and McDonnell Douglas companies.\nAnd there is a smoldering conflict over telecommunications equipment, one of the largest areas of trans-Atlantic trade. The Federal Communications Commission said last month that it would begin an inquiry into how to operate a blockade of foreign suppliers. The move stems from charges that the United States has moved more quickly to deregulate its telecommunications markets, opening them to foreign suppliers, than the Europeans have.

This is $57 billion less than the spending level Mr. Reagan envisioned for 1988 just two years ago.\nNevertheless, the overall military budget would increase by about $20 billion a year for each of the next five years, to $312 billion in 1988, $332.4 billion in 1989 and $396.9 billion in 1992.\nProposed cuts in commodity price supports and other farm aid would be even bigger than Administration officials indicated last week. Federal spending for these programs would drop from $25.3 billion this year to $21.3 billion in 1988, then to $10.4 billion in 1992.\nCongress has considered major changes in farm programs. But it seems unlikely to approve all the proposed cuts, having rejected similar ideas when it passed a five-year farm bill in 1985.\nMedicare and Medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor, would continue growing. But to slow the growth, Mr. Reagan proposes cutbacks that would save a total of $6.5 billion in 1988, and $58.4 billion over five years, from the amount that would spent under current law.\nThe proposed cutbacks, according to the budget documents, include changes in the Medicare law to trim $3.5 billionfrom Federal payments to hospitals and $1.2 billion from payments to physicians and other medical suppliers in the next fiscal year. The Administration is also proposing legislation to raise premiums and other charges to beneficiaries, so as to increase collections by $570 million in 1988 and $15.7 billion over five years. Some Increases Are Planned\nIn the Medicaid program, Mr. Reagan proposes legislative changes that would save the Federal Government $1.3 billion next year and $19.5 billion over five years, according to the budget documents.\nEven with the proposed changes, the cost of Medicaid would rise, from $26.7 billion this year to $32.5 billion in 1992, an increase of 22 percent. And the Administration sees a 46 percent increase in Medicare spending, from $71.6 billion this year to $104.3 billion in 1992.\nMr. Reagan proposes to increase spending for Federal law enforcement, tax collections, space flight and the National Science Foundation, according to the documents. He seeks to reduce spending for food stamps, child nutrition programs, welfare and support of the Tennessee Valley Authority.\nRepresentative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat who serves on the Appropriations Committee, said, ''The President and other officials discredit the budget process by not sending us serious proposals.'' In past years, he said, ''they sent us proposals they knew their own party wouldn't even buy.''\nThe budget shows deficits declining steadily until 1992, when the President projects a surplus of $12.3 billion. Under a law enacted a year ago, the budget is supposed to be balanced by 1991. Surplus Termed 'Pot of Gold'\nGary D. Bass, executive director of O.M.B. Watch, a research and advocacy group that monitors the Office of Management and Budget, said the projected surplus was no more genuine than ''the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.'' He said that ''Congress will have to start writing a budget from scratch'' because the Administration's proposals appeared to contain ''a lot of gimmicks.''\nMr. Reagan anticipates a deficit of $173.2 billion in the current fiscal year, down from the record $220.7 billion in 1986.\nThese are some highlights of the President's budget, as reflected in the documents:\n* Spending for the space shuttle and other space flight programs, $4.3 billion this year, would rise to $5.6 billion next year and $6.9 billion in 1989. For each of the following three years, it would be around $6.6 billion.\n* Funds for urban parks and historic preservation would be reduced from $29 million this year to $14 million next year, then eliminated.\n* No new loans would be made to build housing for the elderly and handicapped. The Administration proposes to eliminate the loan program in favor of housing vouchers, a kind of scrip that could be used by low-income tenants.\n* Federal aid to college students would be reduced from $7.3 billion this year to $5.5 billion in 1988. Spending on vocational and adult education would be slashed to $524 million, from $1 billion. Spending for elementary and secondary education would rise by $659 million, to $7.2 billion in 1988.\n* Pay raises for the Government's civilian employees would cost $678 million next year and $1.6 billion in 1989. The budget assumes a 2 percent raise that would take effect in January 1988 and another raise later.\n* The Government would get $3.3 billion in the next two years from the sale of the naval petroleum reserves at Elk Hills, Calif., and Teapot Dome, Wyo. In addition, the Government would get $14 billion if Congress approved the President's proposal to sell regional power marketing agencies over the next five years.\n* Federal aid for urban mass transit systems would be cut from $3.5 billion this year to $1.6 billion in 1988 and stay at that level through 1990. But the budget for air traffic control, aircraft inspections and airport improvement, carried out by the Federal Aviation Administration, would rise from $4.8 billion this year to $5.8 billion in 1988.\n* Urban development action grants, which are used to stimulate economic development, and the Legal Services Corporation, which finances legal aid for poor people, would be eliminated. Congress has repeatedly rejected Mr. Reagan's efforts to end these programs.\n* The Government would get $600 million next year by auctioning radio frequencies used for paging devices, cellular telephones and some satellite communications. The proposal is subject to approval by Congress, which has been indifferent to the idea.\n* Federal spending on food stamps would decline from $12.7 billion this year to $12.5 billion next year. The budget for child nutrition and related programs would be reduced to $6.1 billion, from $6.6 billion.\n* The budget for ''family support payments,'' including Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main welfare program, would be reduced from $10.6 billion this year to $9.8 billion in 1988. Mr. Reagan proposes again to eliminate the work incentive program, which provides job training to welfare recipients.\n* The budget for Federal law enforcement, including the work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, would rise from $4.6 billion this year to $5.2 billion next year. The Internal Revenue Service would get $5 billion for collecting taxes in 1988, an increase of $600 million from this year.\nThe President proposes to increas spending for international affairs, including foreign aid, from $14.6 billion this year to $15.2 billion next year and $18.1 billion in 1989.\nThe budget for electricity-producing programs of the Tennessee Valley Authority would decline to $318 million in 1988, from $806 million this year.

344	Economic Crisis Burdened Nakasone	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB1631F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Trying to make workers work less and savers spend more has put Yasuhiro Nakasone, the Japanese Prime Minister, in an unenviable position. He has proposed measures to those effects in a move to revive Japan's economy, which has been battered by a 40 percent rise in the value of the yen, and to appease the United States, which blames its ally for its staggering trade deficit.\nTrying to make workers work less and savers spend more has put Yasuhiro Nakasone, the Japanese Prime Minister, in an unenviable position. He has proposed measures to those effects in a move to revive Japan's economy, which has been battered by a 40 percent rise in the value of the yen, and to appease the United States, which blames its ally for its staggering trade deficit.\nJapanese manufacturers face the worst slump in more than a decade. Layoffs - almost unheard-of in Japan - have begun, and corporate profits are sagging. Meanwhile, United States officials spent much of 1986 pleading with Mr. Nakasone to encourage domestic growth, with the hope of transforming the Japanese from exporters into importers.\nBy using the problems to his advantage, Mr. Nakasone won re-election in July, and in another shrewd move he named his chief party rival, Kiichi Miyazawi, finance minister.\nMr. Nakasone has forged a bilateral agreement with the United States, pushed for a cut in the discount rate and pressed companies to give workers wage increases, two-day weekends and longer vacations. His tax plan, moreover, ended tax-free savings accounts.\nBut while some observers view his policies as extreme steps, others describe them as window dressing aimed at forestalling protectionist legislation in the United States. This latter view gained credence when Japan recently announced its budget, which provided for the smallest spending increase in three decades.\nBUSINESS PEOPLE: 1986'S NEWSMAKERS IN FINANCE

But a dispute may yet surface if the families of three other crew members press their cases. If so, it would probably center on one question: Who was more responsible for the Challenger disaster, the manufacturer of the space shuttle's solid booster rockets or the Federal agency that was supposed to be overseeing its work?\nThat question would probably have come to the fore if Federal officials had simply settled the families' claims against the Government, and left Morton Thiokol, the manufacturer of the rockets, to deal separately with the families. All Claims Dropped\nInstead, the Justice Department included the rocket maker in the settlement, and the families agreed to drop all further claims against any of the space shuttle contractors. Neither Government officials nor Thiokol would discuss the reasons such an accord was reached.\nOfficials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who were not directly involved in the negotiations, say privately that Thiokol's inclusion probably saved the Chicago-based company millions of dollars in legal fees and potential jury judgments.\n''Letting Morton Thiokol fight these cases alone wasn't a viable choice,'' said Mark A. Dombroff, formerly the director of the torts branch of the Justice Department's civil division, which handled air crash litigation for the Government. Noting that NASA officials would inevitably be drawn into suits between Thiokol and the families, he added: ''The Government wouldn't be buying any peace.'' Unsettled Claims\nJustice Department officials declined to discuss the settlements or their legal strategy, noting that the claims of three families - including one that has a suit pending against Thiokol - are unresolved. Nor would they provide details of the settlement. The amount to be paid to the families, a cost being shared by Thiokol and the government, has not been released.\n''It's not something we are interested in talking about,'' said Philip Wyna, director of corporate development at Thiokol. ''The only thing we are saying is that we are making a substantial payment toward the settlements.''\nAt the Justice Department, Amy Brown, a spokesman, said that ''the settlement should not be construed as an admission of liability or negligence by Morton Thiokol.'' 4 Families Involved The settlements involved the families of Francis R. Scobee, the mission commander, and Air Force Lieut. Col. Ellison S. Onizuko. They also included two non-Government employees: Gregory B. Jarvis, who worked for the Hughes Aircraft Corporation, and Christa McAuliffe, the New Hampshire schoolteacher who was to have been the first ''teacher in space.''\nNo settlements have been reached with the families of Judith A. Resnick, Michael J. Smith or Ronald E. McNair. Mr. McNair's survivors have filed suit against Thiokol.\nIn recent months, legal experts have said that should Thiokol go to court, it would probably assert two primary defenses. First, they speculated, the company would contend that it was immune from liability because it was acting in behalf of the Government.\nIn May, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting in Richmond, overturned awards against three contractors made to the families of four men killed in military air crashes. It ruled that the Government's sovereign immunity extends to its contractors.\nThiokol's second defense would probably be that officials at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, which was overseeing the booster rocket project, were ultimately responsible for the accident. Such a contention could lead to presentations of the same witnesses and documents that dominated the hearings of the Presidential commission that investigated the accident.\n''It would be a very ugly scene,'' one senior NASA official said recently. Noting that the commission, chaired by former Secretary of State William P. Rogers, had carefully avoided placing blame on individuals, the official added: ''All of a sudden, everyone would be pointing fingers.'' Insurance Coverage\nUnder the terms of its contract, Thiokol carries insurance for the first $500 million in judgments against the company for the failure of its rockets. Beyond that figure, the company was indemnified by the Government, according to Susan Smith, the general counsel of the Marshall Space Flight Center.\nBy contrast, Rockwell International, the maker of the shuttle orbiter, is now indemnified by the Government for all judgments resulting from a failure of its equipment. It was Rockwell, not the Government, that paid the survivors of the three astronauts killed in the Apollo 1 launch-pad fire in 1967.\nMeanwhile, Ms. Smith said she is negotiating with Thiokol over the company's penalty for the failure of its rocket, a penalty that could reach $10 million under terms of the contract.

The company's largest franchises are in Tucson, Ariz., Syracuse and areas of Oregon and Washington state. Mr. Cooke called it ''the cornerstone of an ever-expanding media empire.'' Reassembling Media Empire\nMr. Cooke, 73 years old, began two years ago to acquire cable television and publishing holdings after retiring as chairman of Group W Cable. He lost a hostile takeover bid for Multimedia Inc., the Greenville, S.C., publisher and cablecaster, but made $24.5 million on the deal.\nHe bought the Los Angeles Daily News in 1985 and has made unsuccessful bids since then for The Evening News Association in Detroit and The Louisville Times and The Courier-Journal, Kentucky's largest newspapers.\nMr. Cooke, born in Canada, began his career in broadcast and publishing running a radio station in Stratford, Ontario, for the late Lord Thomson. He helped Lord Thomson assemble his broadcasting and publishing empire in Canada and the United States. Stint at Retirement\nBy 1960 Mr. Cooke had accumulated publishing and radio properties of his own, along with a minor league baseball team and Canada's largest plastics company. He sold his holdings and moved to the United States during a stint at retirement, but quickly returned to business with the founding of the American Cablevision Company in 1964.\nHe acquired a 12 percent stake in Teleprompter, then sold the company in 1981 to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation for more than $1 billion.\nAmong his other interests are the Elmendorf Farm thoroughbred breeding stables and the Chrysler and Kent buildings in New York City.

None of the big-capitalization blue chips that surged ahead and grabbed the headlines - issues such as Merck, Eastman Kodak and General Electric -were among the top performers.\nInstead, the roster of best-performing issues included a retailer of consumer electronics, a mining company, a mutual fund management company and an equipment supplier to Sears, Roebuck. Specialty retailers also fared handsomely.\nIssues posting the largest percentage losses had more in common. A number of losers were companies in various facets of the recession-ridden energy industry. Others, such as the GCA Corporation and Floating Point Systems, were technology companies affected by the decline in capital spending.\nThe Service Resources Corporation, the top performer of 1986 with a gain of 235.1 percent, had a dramatic turnabout. A year earlier, when it was known as the Norlin Corporation, the company ranked as the Big Board's second-biggest loser, with a decline of 74.1 percent. The company, whose basic business is to provide office support services to law firms and investment banking firms, has operated at a deficit since 1980, but lately its financial position has improved. Spanish Bank Does Well\nThe American Depository Receipts of Banco Central, Spain's largest bank, rose $23.75, or 226.2 percent, to $34.25, to rank as the exchange's second-best performer. This reflected an improving economy in the bank's service areas.\nPlacing third with an increase of 220 percent was the Patten Corporation, which moved to the Big Board from the over-the-counter market in October. Patten, which subdivides undeveloped rural properties for sale to individuals, has reported sharply rising profits.\nWinners with the most familiar names were retailers. Reebok International, for example, which sells athletics footware, gained 152.7 percent. It also came to the exchange from the over-the-counter market. New Tack at The Gap\nThe Gap, a specialty apparel retailer, benefited from a new merchandising strategy that rejuvenated profits and sent the shares ahead $20.25, to $35.75, a gain of 130.6 percent. It also appeared on the 1985 list of winners.\nThe average gain for a Big Board stock was 13.98 percent, with virtually all of the advance occurring in the opening quarter. The exchange's composite index closed the year at 138.58, after reaching a record high of 145.75 on Sept. 4. As uncertainty over the economy grew throughout the year, many of the big, blue-chip stocks outperformed the rest of the market, with the Dow Jones industrial average posting a 22.6 percent gain for the year. It set a high of 1,955.57 on Dec. 2.\nTurnover for the exchange, swelled by program trading, reached 35.68 billion shares, topping record set in 1985 by 29.7 percent.\nThe First City Bancorporation of Texas, whose shares plummeted $9.50, to $3.375, showed the largest percentage loss, 73.8 percent. The company omitted its dividend in November and is expected to report a large loss for 1986. Like many other Texas banks, First City has suffered from a recession in real estate as well as in the energy industry.\nIts decline was only slightly larger than the GCA Corporation's drop of 73.3 percent. GCA, which makes semiconductor production equipment, also appeared on the 1985 list of losers.\nOne percentage gainer provided something of a mystery. L. E. Myers, a utility construction contractor, has shown heavy losses in recent years. But its shares rose 126.3 percent in 1986. Elliott Robbins, a senior vice president, said Wednesday that the recent price increase apparently reflected a new investor with a 6.6 percent stock ownership in Myers. He identified the investor as Leonard Chavin, a Chicago real estate developer. ''He has not indicated any plans so far to us,'' Mr. Robbins said. MOST ACTIVE N.Y.S.E.

351	BIG PRICE INCREASES SHAKE BRAZILIANS	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA1731F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: After what one local economist called ''a hiatus of generalized happiness,'' Brazilians appear to be rapidly losing faith in the anti-inflation program decreed by the Government last February.\nAfter what one local economist called ''a hiatus of generalized happiness,'' Brazilians appear to be rapidly losing faith in the anti-inflation program decreed by the Government last February.\nOnly a few months ago, when a price freeze stimulated wild consumer spending, the country seemed entranced by the promise of ''zero inflation.'' But price jumps running at an annual rate of 70 percent in November and December have now forced the Government to revive a recently discarded ''indexation'' system linking interest rates and wages to inflation. Some Prices Double\nAs a final burst of Christmas spending gave way to the New Year, the ''meltdown'' of the price freeze was also at hand. Some products doubled in price today, and others, including meat and eggs, are available mainly on the black market through payment of an illegal premium.\nOne immediate consequence of the wave of economic uncertainty is that the country's Finance Minister, Dilson Funaro, whose identity with the so-called Cruzado Plan had won him enormous popularity, is now the target of bitter criticism. His offer to resign was rejected by President Jose Sarney in late November, but there is once again intense speculation that he may soon be replaced.\n''The Cruzado Plan is dead,'' said Affonso Celso Pastore, a former Central Bank president who criticized the price freeze at its inception.\n''Its death certificate will give the cause as 'generalized inflationary infection affecting all vital organs, stimulating the spread of indexation,' the same tumor that was so brilliantly removed on Feb. 28.'' Freeze Tied to Election\nOther economists, bankers and businessmen have criticized the Government for maintaining the boom provoked by frozen prices until after nationwide elections Nov. 15. They charge that this move not only disrupted the domestic economy, but also created financial problems on the eve of crucial negotiations to restructure Brazil's $110 billion foreign debt, the largest in the developing world.\nEconomic growth estimated at over 11 percent in 1986 sucked in imports and found a home for products once destined for export, with the result that the monthly trade surplus fell from an average of over $1 billion as recently as July to little over $100 million in November and December.\nAt the same time, foreign exchange reserves tumbled to about $5 billion, from $11 billion, in just 12 months. ''This was an external crisis entirely made in Brazil,'' one economist noted acidly. A Fatuous Belief Noted\n''The curious thing,'' Senator Roberto Campos, a former Planning Minister, said, ''is that the population really believed a simple decree freezing prices could result in a miracle that has been sought for millennia -a painless cure for inflation, accompanied by rapid growth and redistribution of income.''\nThe turning-point came Nov. 21 when the administration finally moved to slow down the economy by sharply raising prices and taxes for a number of goods and services. Coming just six days after the governing party won a stunning victory in the mid-term elections thanks to the popularity of the price freeze, the so-called Cruzado Plan II provoked angry protests and even an attempt by the labor movement to paralyze the country in a general strike Dec. 12.\nArguing that the increases were ''necessary adjustments'' as the economy moved from a price freeze to price controls, Mr. Funaro has insisted that Brazil can still avoid both inflation and recession in the coming year. In an article this week, though, the Finance Minister implicitly accepted the ''death'' of the Cruzado Plan, noting that its main ''legacy'' was to strengthen ''the structural conditions for economic and social growth.'' Too Little, Too Late\nYet, even among businessmen who profited handsomely from the recent consumer boom and now recognize the need for deflationary measures, the Sarney administration is perceived to have done too little, too late. ''The fact is that the Government became immobilized and did not adopt the measures that were not politically attractive,'' Luis Eulalio de Bueno Vidigal, a prominent business leader, said.\nFurther, since the Cruzado Plan II, private-sector confidence has not been restored. ''One gets the impression that the Government is disorientated by what's going on,'' one well-placed foreign banker said. ''It has no coherent policy, its credibility has gone. It announced this week that interest rates would only be indexed for January and February, but no one believes that.''\nOfficials said the Government acted to protect real interest rates for savings accounts and treasury bonds and to bring down nominal interest rates, which were running at around 240 percent last month. They also conceded that wages will automatically increase when accumulated inflation since February 1986 reaches 20 percent, probably later this month.\nThe Government's hope is that it can bring order to the economy before the first anniversary of the Cruzado Plan by signing a ''social pact'' with business and labor groups aimed at curbing price increases and wage demands. Having given civil servants an extra month's salary for 1986 and a 25 percent wage increase as of Jan. 1, however, it will be under pressure to demonstrate that it is not contributing to inflation.
352	O'CONNOR, IN JERUSALEM, APOLOGIZES TO ISRAELIS	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DA1731F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: John Cardinal O'Connor of New York today used the occasion of his first public ceremony in Israel to apologize to the country's people and Government for canceling meetings he had scheduled with leading Israelis.\nJohn Cardinal O'Connor of New York today used the occasion of his first public ceremony in Israel to apologize to the country's people and Government for canceling meetings he had scheduled with leading Israelis.\n''It is fitting and it behooves me to say that I deeply regret and certainly apologize for any offenses that might have been perceived as intended by those who govern Israel,'' he declared at a New Year's Day mass in St. Saviour's Church, in the Old City of Jerusalem, The Cardinal, in remarks from the altar that he later said had not been planned, took the blame for hastily scheduling then rescinding appointments with President Chaim Herzog and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. No Ill Will, He Says\nHe said he had not realized that Vatican protocols forbade meetings in Jerusalem with top-ranking Israelis. The Vatican does not recognize Israeli control over the city, the eastern part of which was captured from Jordan and annexed during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.\n''I failed to be sufficiently thorough in my preparations,'' he said. ''I failed to familiarize myself with the protocols normally surrounding a visit by a member of the College of Cardinals. Because of that error on my part, unfortunately, it is quite understandable that the people of Israel and those in the Government might well have construed some deliberately intended offense.''\nThe Cardinal also asserted that the error had been made without any ill will, that the Vatican too ''bears no ill will'' toward Israel and that he hoped to find an opportunity to make ''whatever compensation can appropriately be made.''\nThe Cardinal's dramatic apology, which he delivered at the end of a mass stressing Pope John Paul II's World Day of Peace message, came after more than a week of bruised feelings here over the planning of the trip.\nBoth Mr. Shamir and Mr. Herzog had said they would refuse to meet the Cardinal anywhere but in their offices in Jerusalem. Shimon Peres, the Foreign Minister, who extended the original invitation to the Cardinal to visit Israel, has also been reluctant to meet with him outside his Jerusalem office and no meeting has been scheduled.\nBut the Cardinal did meet today with Jerusalem's Mayor, Teddy Kollek, at the Mayor's municipal offices. The two described their meeting as warm and gracious and both took the occasion to place a cheerful phone call to Mayor Koch in New York.\nMr. Kollek said that at their 45-minute meeting he had tried to explain to the Cardinal that Jerusalem had been a Jewish capital since biblical days, that the Israeli Government had protected Christian and Moslem holy sites since it took over the whole of the city and that the city was freer for worship than it had ever been before. In 1967, Mr. Kollek noted, 200 Israeli soldiers died trying to recapture the Old City because the army decided not to use artillery or other weapons that might damage holy sites. A Distinction Is Noted\nA reporter asked Mr. Kollek why the Cardinal would meet with him in Jerusalem but not with other Israeli leaders. The Mayor replied, ''Because the city is not a political entity, it is an administrative entity.'' When the reporter responded that he did not understand what that distinction meant, the Mayor replied, ''Neither do I.''\nThe Mayor praised the Cardinal for righting a diplomatic gaffe ''very graciously by taking the blame on himself.'' There was no immediate response from other Israeli officials to the Cardinal's apology.\nAfter a four-day trip to Jordan, where he made several statements expressing support for the right of Palestinians to self-determination, the Cardinal entered Israel by walking across the Allenby Bridge, a short, narrow span over the muddy Jordan River. The Cardinal said he chose to enter Israel on foot as pilgrims had done for centuries.\nFew pilgrims, however, are met by a crowd of jostling reporters and photographers, as Cardinal O'Connor was today.\nArchbishop Carlo Curis, the Apostolic Delegate to Jerusalem, welcomed the Cardinal. But Israel was respresented only by two low-level Foreign Ministry officials and the Ministry of Religious Affairs.\nThis was in sharp contrast to the Cardinal's arrival in Jordan on Sunday night when he was met by the Minister of Islamic Affairs, the Governor of Amman and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Cardinal also met with King Hussein and other high-ranking Jordanian leaders. A spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Israel had downgraded the Cardinal's visit to a private rather than an official event. 'Next Year in Jerusalem'\nThe Cardinal, exploiting the fact that he entered Israel on New Year's Day, told reporters, ''Yesterday I said in Amman, 'Next year in Jerusalem,' so I kept my promise.''\nThe Cardinal's motor caravan drove from the bridge through the ancient city of Jericho, then headed out of the river valley up bare mountains tinged with pink and orange and dotted with Bedouin tents and the mud hovels of Palestinians. Just outside Jerusalem, but still in the occupied West Bank, the motorcade passed Maale Adumim, a town first settled after the 1967 war by Israelis who believe the West Bank is part of Israel's larger biblical legacy. The town, with its modernistic housing, has now become a growing suburb of Jerusalem.\nThe motorcade went directly to St. Saviour's Church, where the Cardinal donned white vestments and a miter and celebrated a Latin mass at the invitation of James Beltretti, the Patriarch of the Latin Rite churches in Israel, Jordan and Cyprus.\nThe Cardinal's homily was based on the Pope's World Day of Peace message, but, in veiled fashion, he sounded themes that he had struck while in Jordan that called attention to the plight of the Palestinians. The Cardinal emphasized the Pope's words that the ''solidarity of the human family'' implies that all human beings are ''equal in dignity'' and ''endowed with fundamental and inalienable human rights.''\nHe spoke of the homelessness of Joseph and Mary in the Gospel, a theme that echoed his repeated references to the homelessness of the Palestinians. Joseph and Mary, he said, had to flee into a hostile environment, but were ''finally able to return to their homeland.''\nThe Cardinal also read a long excerpt from Elie Wiesel's ''Night'' in which Mr. Wiesel wrote how as a boy he had watched his father die of hunger and illness in a concentration camp. When his father at the end asked him for water, the young boy in ''Night'' was afraid to risk blows from the camp police and did not bring the water. The Cardinal said Mr. Wiesel was haunted by his failure to heed his father's summons and dedicated his life thereafter to strengthening human dignity. A Word to the Violent\nThe Cardinal said he wondered if the world responded to the Pope's summonses when he spoke of peace with justice or asked for an end to weapons stockpiles.\nThe Cardinal called on ''those who practice violence and terrorism'' to ''turn away from violence even if the goals thereof are just.'' ''The way of violence cannot obtain justice,'' he said.\nHe ended the homily with a paraphrasing of a Jewish blessing, ''May the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,'' he said, ''shine his face on all of us, turn his countenance to each of us, and grant us peace.''\nThe Cardinal later explained that when he saw the numbers of reporters gathered at the church, he decided ''impromptu'' to make an apology ''to all peoples of Israel and its Government.'' He said he had intended some statement because he recognized ''how deeply wounded feelings were.'' 'Out of a Fellini Movie'\nAfter lunch the Cardinal took part in a procession to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the site where Christians believe Jesus was crucified and entombed before the Resurrection.\nThe procession of colorfully clad clergy was led by drummers from a Roman Catholic corps of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and by men wearing fezzes and carrying sheathed swords at their side. The procession wound through narrow stone-paved streets lined with shops selling souvenirs, jewelry, brass and wood and crowded with tourists and merchants in Arab headdress. Policemen and rifle-bearing Israeli troops tried to restrain the dozens of photographers and television crew members pushing for a better glimpse of the Cardinal.\nAstonished by the mixture of sacredness, pomp and chaos, the Cardinal's secretary, Msgr. James McCarthy, said later, ''It was a scene out of a Fellini movie.''

Garen Gdanian, one of the clergymen invited to the Governor's mansion for brunch before the inauguration. ''He should stay here four more years and then run.''\nSylvia Weprin, who with her husband Saul, a State Assemblyman, has held a party on the night before each Cuomo inauguration, saw things differently. Shortly after midnight on New Year's Eve she announced, ''Next time in Washington.''\nWith 18 million people in the state of New York and fewer than 600 orchestra seats at the Governor's inauguration, there were bound to be some who tried to sit where they were not allowed.\nLarry Stone, 15 years old, an usher in a military-style uniform of his school, the Christian Brothers Academy of Albany, reported that despite his efforts, several people had managed to slip small children in under false pretenses, and others had simply barreled their way in.\nNot one to be pushed around, Larry refused to let a tall, balding man without a ticket get past him, until someone whispered threateningly that he was holding up Ed Koch.\nLarry said he was not embarrassed that he had not recognized the Mayor of New York City. ''What, am I supposed to know everyone?'' he asked.\nDespite a turnout of 4,200 people, several prominent political figures did not attend, including Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse M. D'Amato, former Gov. Hugh L. Carey and the Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, who was the Governor's Republican opponent in the last election. Also absent was Warren M. Anderson, the majority leader of the Republican-controlled State Senate.\nSubdued giggles could be heard when the members of the State Senate were solemnly announced, and 4 out of 61 straggled out.\nOrchestrating the inauguration, a pageant involving hundreds of student musicians, scores of state officials and eight Indian chiefs, is not an easy task.\nA lot of people, anticipating the Governor's landslide victory, actually urged the chairman of the inaugural committee, Tonio Burgos, to start planning the inauguration before the election results were in. Indeed, he said, someone had even gone so far as to suggest this in a memo.\n''I urged them to destroy that memo,'' Mr. Burgos said. ''I thought it was a little presumptuous.''\nIn keeping with the Governor's theme of ''doing more with less,'' this year's inauguration, more elaborate than ever, cost less than the last one, which cost less than the one before.\nOrganizers of the inauguration said the key to coming in under $50,000 this year was finding free goods. A 10-foot-tall rendering of the New York State seal that stood by the entrance to the auditorium, for example, was borrowed from the World Trade Center. The poinsettias that lined the stage were grown in state prisons.\nOrganizers of the inauguration, which for the purposes of live television coverage was to last precisely 58 minutes, left little room for chance to interfere.\nParticipants in the procession were warned not to hold things up, as had the last lieutenant governor, Alfred Del Bello, when the announcement of his appearance coincided with a trip by him to the men's room.\nAudience members were warned to expect the boom of the 19-gun salute, so they would not panic, as they had last time, and think it was a bomb.\nIn a remarkable example of fail-safe planning, a young man was stationed inside the lectern to hand the Governor a copy of his address in case the Teleprompter broke down. ''Basically, I did it because of the Governor,'' said the young man, Michael McCartin, a student at the State University of New York at Binghamton. ''I really admire him.''\nFor the four men who took the oath of office here today, the inauguration was a happy occasion, suffused with the sweet smell of success. But for mothers, nothing is ever so simple.\nRuth Lundine, whose son Stan was sworn in as lieutenant governor, said she had to confess that she was happier when he was in Congress. In that job, she said, at least he came home to his native Jamestown every summer to be with his constituents, not to mention his mother.\nIn fact, Mrs. Lundine, who is 73 years old, admitted that although she knew it was politically incorrect to say so, she really had no grand ambitions for Stan. ''I was perfectly happy when he was Mayor of Jamestown,'' she said.\nThe theme of the reception following the inauguration was ''Celebrating New York,'' and there appeared to be enough food to invite most of the state. The underground mall beneath the Capitol was decked out as a hodgepodge of neighborhoods from across the state and outfitted with scores of hot-dog stands, apple carts and pretzel vendors. Representing Jamaica, Queens, was a wall painting of the Governor's father's Italian grocery store; in front of it was a display of kosher food.\nFreihofer's bakery in Albany donated a five-tier, 500-pound cake topped with 600 pounds of icing. In the spirit of the occasion, the cake was decorated with the state seal, the state bird (bluebird), the state tree (sugar maple) and the state animal (beaver). Missing, however, was the state fossil, sea scorpion.\nAt the end of the ceremony, there was no shortage of sentimentality as the families of the inaugurated, including the Governor's 84-year-old mother, Immaculata, came together for a photo opportunity. As the flashbulbs flared, the recorded voice of Neil Diamond filled the hall with a jazzed-up version of ''My Country, 'tis of Thee,'' which has become the Governor's theme song.\nOnly Mark Lundine, 10, seemed unaffected by all the emotion. When the Governor invited him to clap along with the music, he declined.

356	LUNDINE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT NEW ROLE	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D61731F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: For the first time in two years, New York State has a lieutenant governor.\nFor the first time in two years, New York State has a lieutenant governor.\nShortly after 1 P.M. today, flanked by his wife and two sons, former Representative Stan Lundine officially assumed an office that has remained vacant since Alfred B. Del Bello resigned in frustration in January 1985.\nThat resignation was perhaps only the most dramatic criticism of a position that some analysts have said should be abolished as unneeded. And Governor Cuomo, who himself served as lieutenant governor for four years under Gov. Hugh L. Carey, at one time spoke forcefully about the job's tendency to become a political backwater.\nBut, to judge from today's ceremony, the state's second-highest elective office has made a comeback. Long Standing Ovation\nWhen Mr. Lundine and his family appeared at the rear entrance of the large, modern convention hall, grinning broadly under the glare of television lights, the audience broke out in a long standing ovation, matched only by the reception for Governor Cuomo himself. When he recited the oath of office before Judge Fritz W. Alexander 2d, the new Lieutenant Governor was again greeted by a round of unusually long, enthusiastic applause.\nIt was a sweet moment for Mr. Lundine, who gave up his seat in New York's 34th Congressional District to campaign as Mr. Cuomo's running mate. And Mr. Lundine said he was confident he would be involved as a full partner in the development and implementation of government policy.\n''I will be working with the Governor on the State of the State message,'' he said, ''and after that we will move almost directly to the budget.''\nBut he said no effort had been made to specify the role he would play. ''I'll be involved in developing all of the policies of the state. And, in terms of implementation, if we feel he can do the best job on a certain issue, he will do it. If I can, I will.'' 'Minding the Store'\nMr. Lundine's optimism about his new post was shared by many of his political supporters and former colleagues, who pointed out that the importance of the lieutenant governorship will rise dramatically if Governor Cuomo decides to seek the Presidency in 1988.\n''My guess is that the Governor is very anxious to have Stan be very meaningful in the day-to-day operations of government, very much like Mondale was under Carter,'' said Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Long Island Democrat who served with Mr. Lundine during the Lieutenant Governor's 10 years in Congress.\nNoting the Governor's recent announcement that he would make a series of speeches across the country this year, Mr. Downey said: ''I don't think the Governor could travel so much if there weren't somebody he trusted minding the store. Somebody like Lundine gives him the freedom to do more traveling and, hopefully, to be a candidate for national office.''\nMr. Lundine and his wife, Sara, sold their house in Washington and moved to Loudonville, outside Albany, only last week. But a crowd of friends and well-wishers was on hand throughout the inaugural festivities. Among them were dozens of visitors from Jamestown, where Mr. Lundine was Mayor from 1970 to 1976, and an enthusiastic contingent from Ohio, which Mrs. Lundine represented as a lobbyist during the family's years in Washington.

From the Motor City.'' The three-card monte men were back at their boxes. The roar of video-war poured through the door at Playland. A line had formed at the TKTS booth on Duffy Square. And George M. Cohan, in statuary vigil, still cast his regard down Broadway. It was all over, including the shouting. And yet, a new year had dawned; a new start, replete with hope and resolve.\nAt 7:22 A.M., by the watch of Toshimitsu Kuroiwa, the sun rose, then pushed past puffy clouds, out over the horizon from the easternmost point of the metropolitan area, Montauk, L.I.\nMr. Kuroiwa was among about 30 people who witnessed the first new day of the new year from the wind-whipped beach.\n''In Japan, many people come to see the first sunrise of the year,'' said Mr. Kuroiwa, an official at the Japan Trade Center in Manhattan, who has lived in Bayside, Queens, for a year and a half. In his country, he said, sunrise is ''a symbol of natural phenomena, of great things.''\nThere, too, in the shadow of the Montauk Lighthouse, stood 20-year-old Marcy Fyock, an assistant manager at Flower Time in Patchogue, L.I. ''You can get your thoughts together here, it's so peaceful,'' she said.\nShe and three friends had celebrated in Times Square at midnight, then drove to Montauk Point on a whim. ''We were pretty much the first on the beach,'' Miss Fyock said. ''We didn't expect there would be anybody else. Then, we said, 'Boy, there are other fools, too.' ''\nJust after dawn, Masaru Yamai, who lives in Valley Stream, shadowboxed on the beach. ''First I pray for health for my wife and daughters,'' he said. ''After that, I plunge into the water.''\nAt a discreet distance, he disrobed and walked over rocks and into the rough surf. A breaker immediately reminded him of the power of nature and sent him sprawling.\nMr. Yamai remained, only his head above the waves, for about 30 seconds, then strode up the beach to his clothes. ''The idea is not how much you suffer,'' he said. ''It is what your spirit tells you.''\nJust five hours earlier, in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn - a haven for Soviet emigres - revelers were still going strong.\nYura A. Dimov stopped to talk about what the New Year would bring. ''What God will give,'' said Mr. Dimov, who came to the United States nine years ago from Kiev. In America, Mr. Dimov said, it is important to believe in God. ''God gave us freedom,'' he said.\nBoris Golbraykh, who came to the United States eight years ago from Byelorussia, wished ''happiness and peace'' for everyone in the coming year.\nAcross the country, New Year's celebrations assumed a variety of forms.\nIn San Francisco, several hundred people gathered to exchange greetings, via satellite hook-up, with a similar crowd in Moscow. ''We think the more people communicate directly with each other, the greater the chance we will reduce tensions between the two political systems,'' said Joel Schwartz, who organized the event.\nAbove the Benjamin Franklin Bridge between Philadelphia and Camden, N.J., fireworks saluted the start of the bicentennial celebration of the United States Constitution, which was signed Sept. 17, 1787, at Independence Hall.\nAnd in Rochester, 50,000 people raised their razzes in an outdoor kazoo concert.\nHundreds of runners began the New Year on a healthful note with a five-mile race through Central Park that began at the stroke of midnight. Some on the sidelines resolved that 1987 would be the year that they, too, would become more health-conscious.\nMyrna Albert, a 49-year-old teacher from Queens, was dressed in her running attire. But at the last minute, she said: ''I chickened out. It was just a little intimidating. I give myself credit for getting this far.''\nNext year, Miss Albert asserted, she will ''actually run the race.''\nJune Vollmann, a writer from Manhattan, promised herself, ''I'm going to lose 20 pounds,'' adding, ''I say that every year.''\nA magazine editor, Natalie Gerardi, who was also watching the race, had a resolution of a different sort. ''A group of women friends decided that we're going to meet once a month for general discussion,'' she said. ''It's sort of a return to the consciousness-raising days. We used to do it and we miss it, so we're going to do it again.''\nMargie Appel, a 26-year-old framer from Greenwich Village, resolved ''to have as many successes in 1987 as I did in '86.'' In the last year, she said, ''I moved to New York, I got a job that I love, found a new boyfriend whom I love and found an apartment - on Central Park West.''\nLater yesterday morning, at Strawberry Fields in Central Park, a Manhattan artist, Brookie Maxwell, and six friends celebrated New Year's Day by installing a temporary sculpture of the Beatles in their Sergeant Pepper outfits.\n''It's a present to the city for the holidays,'' Ms. Maxwell said of the work. ''We were looking for something that would be happy. It's sort of our Peter Pan or Alice in Wonderland; it's the equivalent for our generation.''\nAt 10 A.M., the group posed for pictures and toasted their creation.\nFor some, New Year's Day was best observed in solitude. Ted Richter strolled alone in Battery Park, tossing crumbs to the pigeons and squirrels scuttling beneath the bare trees.\n''I've been out here for three hours,'' Mr. Richter said, adding that he feeds the sparrows and squirrels about three times a week, because ''the little ones, they lose out.''\nDespite overcast skies and a chill, scores of people chose to celebrate the day by taking a ferry ride to Liberty Island.\nAmong those bundled-up for an early-afternoon crossing were three couples who poured themselves pink champagne and sang ''Auld Lang Syne.''\n''We've been doing this for 14 years,'' said Gail Strickland, who wore a pointed party hat with her mink.

364	'A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED,' MISS MARPLE ON 'MYSTERY!'	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA1231F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: ONE of the more consistent rewards of watching public television's ''Mystery!'' series has been the performance of Joan Hickson, a British character actress in her 80's, as Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. Other actresses, including Margaret Rutherford and Helen Hayes, have done well by the role, but none have captured the amateur sleuth's tiny eccentricities and enormous shrewdness so accurately.\nONE of the more consistent rewards of watching public television's ''Mystery!'' series has been the performance of Joan Hickson, a British character actress in her 80's, as Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. Other actresses, including Margaret Rutherford and Helen Hayes, have done well by the role, but none have captured the amateur sleuth's tiny eccentricities and enormous shrewdness so accurately. Beginning tomorrow at 9 P.M. on Channel 13, Miss Hickson can be seen in ''A Murder Is Announced,'' a three-part series, adapted quite smartly for television by Alan Plater.\nThe time is the 1940's, shortly after World War II. The small village in this particular tale is called Chipping Cleghorn. All is reassuringly calm until one day the local newspaper is published with an advertisement announcing that a murder will take place that very evening at 7 at Little Paddocks, the home of Letitia Blacklock. Suddenly all is atwitter (''How scrumptious,'' exclaims one sweet lady) and Miss Blacklock's closest friends are preparing to visit her at the appointed hour. It's highly unlikely, of course, that anything will happen, but just in case.\nAmong the more prominent characters: playful Julia and Patrick, brother and sister, who have recently shown up as Miss Blacklock's young cousins; Philipa, another young relative, with a propensity to dourness; dear Miss Bunner, Miss Blacklock's old school chum and something of a ''scatty'' old lady; Colonel Easterbrook, once of India, and his wife with the badly bleached blond hair; the mannish Miss Hinchcliffe and her gently dizzy housemate Miss Murgatroyd; a darling little mother and her grown son, who insists he is a Communist, and, hardly least, the very foreign-looking maid, a war refugee.\nIt is, in short, the usual type of unlikely mix that Agatha Christie found irresistible. In any event, with everybody gathered together, the clock strikes 7 and the announced murder does indeed take place. The lights go off, a figure enters the room with a flashlight and shots are heard. When light is restored, the intruder, a young man wearing a mask, is found dead and Miss Blacklock is nursing a bleeding ear, apparently nicked by the bullet meant to kill her. Did the stranger commit suicide when his murder plot went awry? Nothing, obviously, could be that simple at the very beginning of a Miss Marple story.\nThe police inspector (John Castle) suspects foul play, but a little old lady in sensible shoes and proper gray suit has no doubt whatsoever. Miss Marple happens to be staying at a nearby hotel where the dead man, a Swiss national, worked as a clerk. She has already discovered that he doctored one of her personal checks in his favor. Furthermore, she tells the inspector, ''It struck me that the man had a shifty eye, the kind that looks straight at you and never blinks.'' In no time at all, Miss Marple has the police searching for a murder suspect, and she reminds the inspector that ''some of the best murderers are women, especially in an English village.''\nProduced by Guy Slater and directed by David Giles, this BBC-Arts & Entertainment co-production has a delicious supporting cast, ranging from such veterans as Sylvia Syms, Joyce Carey, Mary Kerridge, Joan Sims and Ralph Michael, to the perhaps less familiar faces of Simon Shepherd, Samantha Bond, Nicola King, Paola Dionisotti and Matthew Solon. But most of all there is Miss Hickson, who has relatively few scenes but remains the dominant force throughout. Her Miss Marple is a treasure and, as usual, strikingly astute as she observes how the English village has changed. It may still look simple, peaceful and eternal, but today it is battered by people arriving from anywhere with no biographies. Everybody used to know one another, she says, now there are no letters of introduction, no roots. If you haven't guessed, Miss Marple is offering a clue to this mystery's solution.\nTV WEEKEND

But both colleagues and critics of Joseph J.

But both colleagues and critics of Joseph J. Pinola, First Interstate's 61-year-old chairman, also use such words as ego, affection and revenge.\nMr. Pinola began his banking career in 1952 at the Bank of America, and in 23 years rose to one of the top six jobs at what was then the largest United States bank. After he was passed over to succeed A. W. Clausen as chief executive - the job went to Samuel H. Armacost - Mr. Pinola left in 1976 to lead the United California Bank, which is now the First Interstate Bank of California.\nAnd now Mr. Armacost is out, Mr. Clausen is back in control, and Mr. Pinola is again seeking to succeed his former boss.\n''Joe's got a soft spot in his heart for Bank of America,'' said G. Robert Truex Jr., the chairman of the Rainier Bancorporation of Seattle, who was previously at BankAmerica. ''He'd like to be the guy on the white charger who saves it.''\nIf he does pull off a successful merger and secure Federal approval, Mr. Pinola would face new challenges. From commanding a $50 billion regional company, he would head a $170 billion institution that would be second in size only to Citicorp.\nNo one doubts his stamina. Mr. Clausen has few kind words today for Mr. Pinola, whom he has accused of using ''reckless'' and possibly illegal takeover tactics. But before merger talks turned hostile and before he returned to BankAmerica, Mr. Clausen praised his former employee. ''He works very hard, he's willing to make sacrifices, and he knows what he wants,'' Mr. Clausen said.\nBUSINESS PEOPLE: 1986'S NEWSMAKERS IN FINANCE
366	BACKER OF FRENCH YACHT FINDS NO BOON IN RACING	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D71231F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Serge Crasnianski, a French businessman who has invested $10 million in French Kiss' effort to win the America's Cup, has found it a sobering experience.\nSerge Crasnianski, a French businessman who has invested $10 million in French Kiss' effort to win the America's Cup, has found it a sobering experience.\nInstead of increasing sales for KIS France, his multimillion-dollar company, the association with the America's Cup appears to have eaten away profits. The 44-year-old Crasnianski has estimated that the venture may have cost the company as much as $70 million in lost revenue.\nCrasnianski feels that KIS's affiliation with a rich man's pastime, as with many in America's Cup racing, has opened his company to what he considers unwarranted criticism.\nCrasnianski first realized the ramification of the criticism at a new products show in Paris in November 1985. Asking Why\n''Afterward, we had a little reaction,'' he said during a recent interview. ''People were saying, 'Why does this company spend this kind of money on a boat - a huge amount of money - when there is unemployment in the country? Why does he spend money on this kind of advertising and not for jobs? ' ''\nCritics started picking at the company veneer, dissecting its inner workings and rousing those who were dissatisfied with KIS products.\n''The last 10 months have been a real nightmare with the cup,'' Crasnianski said. ''When you get this kind of problem, you go down, down, down until there is no place left to go. And then when you have said everything there is to say, then you begin to go up again. It is getting better now. We are in control.''\nIt all began three years ago when Crasnianski was faced with finding a way to promote his company. He had started the firm 23 years ago with the production of a machine that reproduced keys within minutes. Mini-Lab Success\nKIS, which stands for Key Independent System, went bigtime in 1981 when Crasnianski introduced instant photo development. His mini-labs, which were able to process film in less than an hour, cornered 60 percent of the world photo development market.\nWhen the Japanese started moving into the market two years later, Crasnianski decided the time was right to develop an image for his company.\n''We thought about racing cars, football, bicycling and sailing,'' Crasnianski said. ''Our advertising company said that it was one of the biggest moments in history for the America's Cup. The Americans had just lost the Cup, and they told us that in the next three years, it would be very big.''\nCrasnianski is a skier who built his company headquarters in the mountains of Grenoble, France. He was reluctant at first to tie himself to sailing, especially since he knew little about the sport.\nOnce he thought about it, the idea seemed right. With a projected budget of $15 million, part of which was being underwritten by the French Government, Crasnianski saw it as a worthwhile business deal. He did not have the money to compete with the advertising budgets of photo companies such as Fuji or Kodak, but he saw the America's Cup as producing worthwhile results.\n''With the America's Cup, I thought perhaps it was a good thing,'' Crasnianski said. ''With a good boat and a good skipper, it might be worth more than 100 million francs with television and with the press. When we started, we thought sailing was a good image for the company.'' Immense Exposure\nHe concedes that, in some respects, the dividend has paid off. His 12-Meter French Kiss has made it to the semifinals and the exposure in the last year has been immense. But he said the negative spill-off is offsetting any gain.\n''It has not affected our business with our old customers,'' Crasnianski said. ''But it has affected our getting new customers. There are rumors that the company is not stable, or will not be stable in the future. Some have cast shadows of doubt on our business.''\nBesides a key-making machine and the mini-labs, Crasnianski's company produces a color copier. He has recently introduced a new instant blood analyzer and an automatic cookie machine. He says he is confident that those parts of the business will support the slump on the main product side - photo development.\nA recent article in the international edition of Business Week has charged that Crasnianski has misrepresented costs and profits. The article alleges that KIS France has been involved in unsavory business dealings to promote itself. Crasnianski has denied these allegations, maintaining that they are part of a smear campaign by competitors to undercut his products. They have used the America's Cup, he says, as a means to that end. Nearing Elimination\nThe row appears far from over. But not so with Crasnianski's ties to the America's Cup. French Kiss has lost her last three races to New Zealand and if she loses again, she will be eliminated.\nWere it not for a recent meeting with Dennis Conner, Crasnianski could be considered out altogether. But there is a new possibility that appears to intrigue him.\nConner, whose Stars & Stripes will almost surely face New Zealand in the challenger's final, has asked Crasnianski for future support. Crasnianski has not said yes, but neither has he said no.\nTom Whidden, a close friend of Conner who sails as tactician on Stars & Stripes, has confirmed that the two have met. Whidden also has voiced syndicate concern about finding more money.\n''You get to the end, and you start wishing you had more,'' Whidden said. ''Your wishes start growing as the competition gets close.'' AMERICA'S CUP

The students dispersed peacefully about 4 A.M.\nThe protests had begun Thursday morning, when students singing the ''Internationale,'' the Communist hymn, started surging across the square through a thin police line before being repulsed.\nIn the afternoon, another cordon of students swept toward City Hall, then reversed direction and, a few banners flying, tried to enter the square before being halted by the police.\nAt least a dozen arrests were made, with some young people bodily carried by their arms and legs onto waiting police vans.\n''Long live freedom!'' the students chanted. ''Long live democracy!'' came a return roar. Welded by Spirit of Protest\nThe demonstration, held together less by organization than by a spirit of protest, came despite threats of punishment. A week ago the Beijing police had said that no protests could be held in Tian An Men Square.\nDespite the warning, wall posters on college campuses called for a demonstration on New Year's Day. As the week wore on, activity on the campuses, clustered mainly in the far northwest corner of the city, sputtered and appeared to die except for occasional political posters.\nEditorials in newspapers and statements from Government officials accused students of illegal behavior and of undermining stability. As each day passed, the admonitions intensified.\nBut on New Year's Day, students began entering the square singly, in pairs and in small groups. Dressed in thick blue or green cotton padded coats in the subfreezing temperature, they rambled across the vast expanse to huddle in clusters, then dissolving into moving rivers of people. Pavement Was Iced Down\nAcross a broad boulevard from the Forbidden City, a thin police line blocked off most of the square, confining the swirls of students and onlookers to a narrow strip of pavement that had been iced down earlier.\nInside the square, 200 members of the Young Pioneers, the children's organization, ringed the 120-foot-high gray Heroes' Monument decorated with friezes of revolutionary scenes. Huge red banners flapped from atop the columned Great Hall of the People on the west side of the square.\nShortly after 10 A.M., a line of police, backed by blue-and-white jeeps, started to push the crowd on the northern edge of the square toward the east. Policemen with cameras stood atop the jeeps filming faces in the crowd.\n''It is a way of crowd control,'' a young woman student said later.\nAs people were being compressed into an increasingly smaller area, a dense knot of people suddenly burst through the police cordon and moved toward the Monument to the People's Heroes. The fragmented line of police tried to regroup, the green-uniformed men in long fur-colored great coats scrambling to hem in the spreading wave of people. Cries of 'No Arrests'\nAt one point, a few policemen wedged into the turmoil and tried to drag a man out. Cries of ''No arrests, no arrests!'' broke out as the man was hustled off. Swirling, turning this way and that, the crowd compacted into a knot that wove across the square, blocked by the police, but then popping through a lightly manned edge.\nThen, as if on cue, the knot of people, mostly Beijing University students, began the rhythmic, tempestuous chords of the ''Internationale,'' the revolutionary anthem written by Eugene Pottier in 1871, about the time of the Paris Commune, with music by Pierre Degeyter.\nAgain, a phalanx of police charged into the singing mass and half-dragged, half-carried another young man into an splotch of empty square.\nBy then no more than 400 students pressed forward, propelled by an almost independent momentum of the packed mass of bodies, until they reached the steps of the monument.\nAbruptly, they stopped. Hurriedly, the police mustered in front of them.\nThe last words of the ''Internationale'' hung in the air and the clot of protesters swiveled to rejoin the thousands of students and onlookers that lined the street edging the square.\nAs they moved across the square, a surge of students moved down a sidewalk on its eastern border, again singing and chanting. Reinforcements of police double-timed down the broad steps of the Museum of History and the Museum of the Revolution and quickly lined the sidewalk, shoving students and onlookers alike off the street. Roars of Disapproval Another person was grabbed from the crowd by the police, provoking roars of dissaproval. But the crowd pressed on, toward the museum steps. Then, where just an instant before a wave of protesters pushed forward, the sidewalk was jammed with young students and sightseers milling about. Across the street, the empty square was fringed with a green line of police.\n''Why are we here?'' a young woman said. ''We are here for democracy.''\nWhat, she was asked, did that mean to her?\n''Democracy,'' she replied, ''is the public election of our leaders. I responded to the call of the Beijing University students. I am not afraid.''\nA young man said he was not sure what was going on.\n''It is not clear,'' he said. ''I came to see what was happening. I am not afraid. We are protected by the law.''\nBy noon, 2,000 students had formed into a group and began moving eastward toward City Hall. Banners, some on cloth, others on white perforated computer paper, were unfurled, reading ''Support Deng Xiaoping and the Four Modernizations,'' and ''Oppose conservatives and reactionaries.''\nThe crowd spun around and rushed back toward the square, battering against several hundred policemen. At this point, half a dozen students were arrested.\nAlthough foreign journalists could verify only about 10 arrests during the turmoil, Beijing University students maintained they had the names, departments and class years of 24 students who they said had been arrested.\nBy 9 P.M., about 2,000 students had gathered outside the home of Ding Shisun, the president of Beijing University, demanding the release of the students, a promise of no reprisals against demonstrators and the reporting of the demonstration in the press.\nMr. Ding said through a megaphone that he would reply within two hours. Part of the crowd drained away from the house and began marching toward the city center. After two hours, Mr. Ding emerged from his house and told a crowd of several hundred students who had remained that the detainees were being released and that he was sending cars to pick them up.\n''If you don't believe me, get a new president,'' he said.\nMeanwhile, the number of marchers began to swell as they left the campus and headed toward People's University. There, as many as a thousand students joined the march. News of Students' Release\nAfter about two miles, when the students had reached the entrance of the Friendship Hotel, they were told by a university official that the detainees had been released.\nCheers rang out, but still the crowd continued to move south for another two miles before being halted by a double phalanx of police. Uncertain what to do next, students began to mill about.\nAt the university, about 2,000 students cheered as the 11 released detainees were driven through the gates. They were hoisted on shoulders of their classmates.\nOne of the students said six policemen had dragged him on the ground when he was seized. Another said he had been struck in the face. Others said they had been kept in a police station all day without food.

Zimroth, now a partner with the law firm of Kostelanetz & Ritholz. He will succeed Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., who is returning to private practice the middle of this month after five years as the city's chief lawyer.\nMr. Zimroth will be the third person to serve as Corporation Counsel since Mr. Koch took office in 1978, and could, if his pattern follows that of his predecessors, become one of the Mayor's closest advisers on matters of policy as well as of law.\nThe job of corporation counsel has long been one of the most sensitive and powerful in the city, and that is especially true now because of the corruption scandal. Mr. Schwarz has acted not only as the city's top lawyer but also as a key adviser to Mr. Koch. He has proposed policy changes in reaction to the scandal, come up with methods of reforming practices that came under attack and participated in a number of difficult news conferences. Recommended by an Aide\nThe Mayor's first Corporation Counsel, Allen G. Schwartz, was also a top adviser. He, Mr. Schwarz and Patrick F. X. Mulhearn, the Mayor's counsel, proposed and screened candidates for the job. According to mayoral advisers, it was one of Mr. Koch's aides who recommended Mr. Zimroth.\nMr. Koch interviewed more than five lawyers for the $94,500-a-year job, including some who declined on the ground that taking it would represent a financial sacrifice, administration officials said. The Mayor had, some weeks ago, tried to persuade Richard Beattie, a lawyer who serves on the Board of Education - a part-time job - to be the Corporation Counsel, but he indicated he would prefer staying in private practice.\nThe office Mr. Zimroth will take over some time next month is, city officials believe, the largest government law office in the country, except for the United States Justice Department. It has more than 500 lawyers and handles all of the city's legal work, ranging from small claims cases to litigation before the United States Supreme Court.\nMr. Zimroth, who will be 44 years old on Jan. 11, joined his law firm in 1980. He was with the Manhattan District Attorney's office from 1975 to 1980, first as chief of the appeals bureau and then as chief assistant district attorney. Before that, he was an assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York and taught at New York University's law school.\nThe Brooklyn-born lawyer is married to Estelle Parsons, the actress, and they have one son, Abraham, who will be four years old next month. The family lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side.

The problem reportedly occurs in cold weather or before the engine is properly warmed up. The inquiry will cover six million automobiles in the 1980 to 1984 model years.\nThe agency will also investigate charges of engine surging or unintended acceleration, covering about 2.3 million J cars from 1982 to 1985.\nThe actions were disclosed by the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group based in Washington, which had filed a petition seeking the inquiry. Notice of the investigations was provided in brief letters to the organization.\nDavid Hudgens, a spokesman for General Motors, said Tuesday that the company would cooperate with the Government in both matters. ''But just because the Government opens an investigation does not mean there is a defect,'' he added. ''In fact, many Government investigations are opened and closed without any finding of defect.'' A Matter of Inconvenience\nMr. Hudgens said the company did not consider the charges concerning power steering flaws to be a safety issue, saying it was more a matter of incovenience because drivers still had manual steering and the problem apparently did not occur when the engine was warm.\nThe J cars are the Chevrolet Cavalier, Buick Skyhawk, Oldsmobile Firenza, Pontiac 2000/Sunbird and Cadillac Cimarron. The A cars are the Chevrolet Celebrity, Buick Century, Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and Pontiac 6000. The X-cars are the Chevrolet Citation, Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Omega and Pontiac Phoenix.\nLast February the highway safety agency, which is part of the Transportation Department, ended a low-level investigation into reports of sudden acceleration on some J cars. The agency said at the time that it found no evidence of defects.\nThe agency had also investigated charges of power-steering problems in G.M.'s 1980 and 1981 X cars, but it ended the investigation when it could not find a defect and concluded the problems were ''not significantly safety-related.''

Madoff, were at poolside, where they heard the explosion. Mr. Madoff immediately telephoned Mr. Halpern's room and told him to get out.\nThe passenger elevators were inoperable, and what followed was a frantic flight down stairs only to find a chaotic, smoke-filled lobby. Mr. Halpern said he retreated to a hallway and forced his way onto a service elevator being run by two employees, only to be blocked by more smoke on the next floor. Finally, one employee abandoned the elevator and darted through the smoke and carnage to safety, with Mr. Halpern on his heels.\n''I'm so happy to be alive,' Mr. Halpern said last night from home.\nEmergency information centers were set up by the Red Cross, and the telephone lines were frequently busy as hundreds of calls came in from the States and Europe. New Jersey Coach Calls Home\nOne of the first calls back home came from Christopher J. Donfield, the basketball coach for Bergen Catholic High School of Oradell, N.J. A school contingent of 20 had gone to San Juan to see the team compete in a tournament. Only half an hour after the initial explosion, Mr. Donfield's mother, Helen, got a call at home in Teaneck, N.J.\n''One of the other mothers called and said don't get upset, but there's been a big fire,'' she said. ''Right after that, my son called and said they were all fine, except they were still in their bathing suits. I didn't realize it was so terrible till I saw the news on TV.''\nTo allay fears, Mrs. Donfield said her son ''made all the boys call their parents to tell them they were all right.'' The basketball team, which won the two games it played, is to return tonight.\nSurvivors were shaken. As he escaped, Mr. Halpern said he saw ''many badly hurt people, blood all over some people, and people begging to be taken to the hospital, people being carried off on beach lounges.'' 'It Was a Tearful Scene'\nOnce he was safe, he said, ''my next thought was my wife and children.'' The sons had gone outside to take photographs, ''which probably saved them.'' ''A friend spotted me,'' he recounted, ''and yelled to my wife: 'Arthur's here!' She and my sons practically collapsed. They were afraid they'd never see me again. We embraced. It was a very tearful scene.''\nMr. Halpern returned to New York in the evening with one son, but said his wife and other son stayed behind ''in hope of going back to hotel to retrieve our belongings.'' ''There were a lot of sentimental things - jewelry,'' Mr. Halpern said. Mr. Halpern, 59 years old, an insurance broker and accountant, said he doubted they would ever see their belongings again.\nWhile many families were reunited, other survivors were left not knowing the fate of their relatives.\nJudy Cohen, 40, of Hamden, Conn., said her husband, Al, 56, was missing. ''I know he was in the casino,'' she said, adding that she last saw him in the casino when she stopped to tell him she was going to a beauty parlor.\nThe casino was where many victims were trapped, and some bodies were not immediately identifiable.\nThe Cohens were part of a group of friends on a New Year's trip to Puerto Rico. John Benevento, a Woodbridge, Conn., contractor, told The Associated Press, ''There were 30 of us, and seven are missing.''

''After tomorrow, who knows what?'' said Joan Doll, the secretary to the outgoing Essex County Executive, Democrat Peter Shapiro.\nIn Essex, they play politics spikes up, and some of Mr. Shapiro's aides ran to the bank Wednesday as soon as they got their final check, fearful payment would be stopped by the new Republican administration. Dozens of Mr. Shapiro's managers got New Year's Eve calls telling them not to come in Friday. ''You were fired too?'' Mr. Shapiro said to a mid-level manager who came to say good-bye. ''I don't believe this.''\nMr. Shapiro may have been the best known county executive in America. Newsweek called him ''Prince of the Suburbs,'' and reporters doing profiles of Mr. Shapiro routinely stuck in a ''Wunderkind.'' A Harvard graduate, at 23 he was elected to the State Assembly, and promptly set the freshman record for sponsoring most bills that were passed into law. At 26 he beat the Democratic machine to be elected executive of Essex.\nHe was a model for liberal Democrats trying to survive in the 1980's, for he talked of both social justice and fiscal constraint. Through attrition, mainly, he cut county jobs to 6,500 from 8,300. When he came into office, 4 percent of the managers were members of minority groups in a county that is 40 percent minority; now 36 percent are. Two percent were women; now 46 percent are. He was seen as a prototypical new model leader, often carrying software home at the end of the day to finish projects on his home computer.\nOn his last day in office Wednesday he unplugged the computer and took down the political cartoons from the wall. One showed Mr. Shapiro with a broom, sweeping away patronage. In another he was trying on the shoes of clean government.\nMr. Shapiro spent part of the day on the phone to people like Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, trying to find jobs for his aides. There was so little time, he took care of details himself. ''What's your address?'' he asked the Governor.\nA stickler, he sometimes drove people around him nuts. On the final afternoon, he had his secretary retype the Dukakis letter. ''I never call him Michael,'' he said. ''I call him Mike.''\nIf there were emotional cracks in Mr. Shapiro, they didn't show. ''I'm not a stress kind of person,'' he said. ''I'm a very strong type. Anybody will tell you this; I've got a pretty tough constitution.''\nHe said he knew he was in trouble last summer after the Board of Freeholders - with whom Mr. Shapiro had been warring - passed a 22 percent tax increase. ''I was the only high county official running for office,'' he said. ''People blamed me.'' In early September he met with his pollster, Paul Maslin. How big a problem is the tax increase? Mr. Shapiro asked. ''It's real big,'' said Mr. Maslin.\n''The psychological thing came through,'' Mr. Shapiro said, ''and I said, 'God, this may be it.' ''\nBack in 1985 - when he had still never lost an election - a reporter for The Bergen Record asked Mr. Shapiro about his cockiness. ''It's a spiritual sense,'' Mr. Shapiro replied, ''that there's something beyond that intervenes on my behalf.'' On his final day, he said he still felt that way, it just did not always translate into election victories.\nHe says he does not know what he will do next, though he has had good offers. He says he wants to make more than his $75,000 county salary and will make a job decision by April 1. ''I don't have a lot of savings,'' he said. ''I can't take off for an indefinite period.''\nAsked if he would run for governor in 1989 -as he did in 1985 - he said, ''No, I doubt that, I really severely doubt that,'' and then added, ''I don't want to close the door to anything.'' Asked if he had plans for his first day off, he said, ''Want me to check?'' and called up his schedule on the computer. ''Nothing scheduled,'' he said.\nIt was after 5 by the time he said good-bye to everyone and cleaned out his office. In the end, it came down to eight boxes of mementos loaded onto two dollies. The Hall of Records was quiet as he waited for the elevator. ''This elevator used to be run manually,'' Mr. Shapiro said, ''a patronage job. I converted them all to automatic.''\nA cleaning man helped Mr. Shapiro load his county car, a Chevrolet. Mr. Shapiro had set a policy of county employees using moderate-priced cars. When Sheriff Thomas D'Alessio had tried to get a Buick, it became an issue, and Mr. Shapiro refused to budge unless the sheriff found a Buick for the price of a Chevy.\nSome have said if Mr. Shapiro had bent more on things like the Chevy principle, he might have been starting his third term, instead of riding home with the boxes. But others said it wasn't Mr. Shapiro's style to do lots of bending.\nThe last one to leave that night was Mr. Shapiro's chief of staff, Ray Codey, who turned out the lights.\nCOLUMN ONE: OUR TOWNS
373	SUBWAYS HOLD RESIDUE OF NEW YEAR'S REVELS	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DC1331F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: It is 4:52 A.M. and someone out there is still blowing a New Year's Eve horn. The squeal ricochets off the subway walls, bounces down the rails and disappears somewhere in the southbound tunnel of the 42d Street station.\nIt is 4:52 A.M. and someone out there is still blowing a New Year's Eve horn. The squeal ricochets off the subway walls, bounces down the rails and disappears somewhere in the southbound tunnel of the 42d Street station.\nNo one on the platform is amused. The 20 or so people are already annoyed by the half-hour wait for the F train. Most of them are also trying to shake off sleep. A few are reeling with the first ache of a hangover.\nOn a nearby bench, a teen-ager with an ashen face sits bent forward, holding his head between his knees. He is sweating Budweiser. The horn keeps blaring. Errrr-raaaa. Errrr-raaaa. Errrr-raaaa. ''Oh God,'' he says. ''Make him stop.''\nSuch scenes were common early yesterday morning in the New York subway - a morning perhaps even more motley and painful than usual because it marked the end of the city's New Year's Eve celebration.\nAs late as 5 A.M., subway cars clanking through Manhattan often were filled to near-rush hour levels. If the revelers had not been wearing red-sequined slippers, or cowboy boots with spurs, or leather chaps, or confetti in their hair, or cardboard tiaras or white top hats or metallic blue fezzes, they could have passed for party-addled New Yorkers on any late weekend night.\n''Que pasa? Que pasa?'' yelled 18-year-old Donna Rice of Poughkeepsie as she danced along the edge of the platform at the Times Square station. ''We're looking for action, you know.'' She pulls out her horn. Errrr-raaaa. Errrr-raaaa. Errrr-raaaa.\nA few yards away, a girl who could not have been older than 10 was aiming her horn into the receiver of a pay telephone. Errrr-raaaa. Errrr-raaaa. Errrr-raaaa. At another part of the station, two grown men seemed to be imitating John Belushi imitating Miles Davis. Errrr-raaaa. Errrr-raaaa. Errrr-raaaa. Not everyone was part of the subterranean symphony that saturates the subway system on the morning after New Year's Eve. There were a few cautious clusters returning home from an evening of dining and dancing.\nThere were the homeless and the panhandlers, too, of course. For the most part, though, the trains were filled with knots of urban ordinariness: the downtown clubsters cantering from bar to bar to bar; the uptown yuppies heading home, and the occasional tourist asking how to get to Grand Central Station and griping about the city.\n''I've been in New York before with my buddies, but never on New Year's Eve,'' said Brian Robbins, 28, a construction worker from Cromwell, Conn., on the No. 1 train as it lumbered into Penn Station at 2:05 A.M. ''Never again. Too much retardation.\n''I've seen riots, fistfights, people killing each other,'' he added between gulps of beer. ''We couldn't believe it. The ball was coming down and a bottle went by my head and it was like war.'' 'I'm a Rowdy Person'\nHe gulps beer again. ''I'm a rowdy person, you know,'' he said. ''But this is too much for me.''\nLike many things in New York City, subway crime is exaggerated to mythical proportions. But there are times when the underlying reality surfaces, particularly in the early morning hours.\n''The doors are locked; the doors are locked!'' shouts a husky man with a wild black beard and a green plaid coat riding the F train into Brooklyn. ''I can't get out! You can't get out! No one can get out! I could pull a gun and shoot everyone in here and no one would get out.''\n''Let me out of here,'' he yells. ''I hate this place.'' Threatening a Dumpster\nThe train stops at West Fourth Street. He stumbles out the door. He starts to sing: ''Here we go loop-de-le. Here we go loop-de-li.'' A few hours earlier, at 1:47 A.M., a tall man with a short temper was standing on the southbound platform at 96th Street and threatening a giant green trash can. ''You don't know who I am, do you?'' he told the Dumpster. ''Yeah, you know. Get away, or I'll kill you.''\nLeaving Manhattan, the chaos of the first morning of the year seems to dissipate. In Brooklyn, a handful of riders on the train to Coney Island doze sitting up in their seats. At each stop, when the doors open no one comes in, no one goes out.\nAt 5:42 A.M., inside the Carroll Street subway station, all appears calm, the station empty, the tracks quiet.\nIn the distance, though, there is a distant wail cutting through the cold and the night. Someone, somewhere, is blowing a horn.

Homicide detectives investigating the case had not been able to locate any witnesses, but several guests reported hearing loud arguments in room 1604, which was later found to be in disarray, said Officer James Coleman, another police spokesman.\nNeither the police nor the hotel would disclose who had checked into that room.
375	SECOND INAUGUAL BY CUOMO SUMS UP ACCOMPLISHMENTS	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DB1331F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Fifty-eight days after winning re-election by the largest margin of any governor in New York State history, Mario Matthew Cuomo was inaugurated today for a second term, saying his administration had proved that government could be both compassionate and fiscally responsible.\nFifty-eight days after winning re-election by the largest margin of any governor in New York State history, Mario Matthew Cuomo was inaugurated today for a second term, saying his administration had proved that government could be both compassionate and fiscally responsible.\n''We proved - together - that the New York idea works,'' Mr. Cuomo said, his 22-minute address interrupted seven times by applause, ''that government can have both a heart and a head, that it can have both common sense and compassion. We proved that we can balance our books without ignoring the reasonable needs of the struggling middle class and poor.'' [ Transcript, page B4. ] The Governor used the speech mainly to look back at the last four years, citing accomplishments and portraying New York as a model for the rest of the country. References to Washington\nThe address came only a day after Mr. Cuomo said in an interview that he would soon begin a series of trips around the country - a signal to some political strategists that he is on the verge of seeking the 1988 Democratic nomination for President - and his speech was filled with references to the country as a whole and to Washington.\n''We can say, as we're being urged to by some in Washington,'' he said, ''that we have stretched our minds and our wills and our resources as far as they will go . . . that we now have to settle for less than we once believed we were capable of, less than was done by our forebears who lifted an entire generation from poverty, defeated Fascism and built this country into the strongest nation in the world.''\n''We have another choice,'' he added. ''We can aim higher.'' Beethoven and Whitman The speech was the centerpiece of a two-hour ceremony before 4,200 guests at the convention center of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Emprire State Plaza, next to the Capitol.\nThe program - interspersed with choral and orchestral pieces that ranged from Beethoven to an ''I Love New York'' medley - included a reading from Walt Whitman's ''A Song for Occupation'' by William Kennedy, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Albany novelist.\nOne by one, three statewide officials - Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, Attorney General Robert Abrams and Comptroller Edward V. Regan - took the oath of office. Then at 1:30 P.M., with howitzers outside the hall booming a 19-gun salute, Mr. Cuomo was given the oath for a second term as the state's 52d Governor by Chief Judge Sol Wachtler. The oath was a public re-enactment of the formal swearing-in at a private ceremony 9:15 Wednesday night at the Executive Mansion. 'So Help Me God'\nLike Mr. Regan - and unlike Mr. Abrams and Mr. Lundine - Mr. Cuomo ended his oath with the words ''so help me God.''\nToday's inaugural was tightly controlled by Cuomo aides to focus as much attention as possible on the Governor. The ceremonies were brought to a standstill for five minutes so Mr. Cuomo's entrance would be made after a statewide television hookup was in place. For his swearing-in and speech - but for none of the others - the house lights were dimmed to draw all eyes to the podium.\nThe 54-year-old Governor - in a dark blue suit, white shirt and red and blue striped tie - showed no signs of the back pain, from a pinched nerve, that has plagued him in recent weeks.\nSitting next to his wife, Matilda, who wore an off-white dress and jacket, he tapped his toe and clapped his hands in time to the music, frequently waving to individuals in the audience. Among them was Mayor Koch. O'Rourke Declined Invitation\nMissing from the crowd was Mr. Cuomo's Republican opponent in November, Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, who declined his invitation.\nMr. Cuomo's address was filled with the images - and sometimes the exact words - that run through most of his major speeches: Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ''lifted himself from his wheelchair to lift this nation from its knees''; the Governor's immigrant parents; childhood afternoons in Queens spent dreaming of a better life; the Statue of Liberty; ''all the government we need, but only the government we need.''\nIt contained no new initiatives. In his first inaugural Mr. Cuomo stressed the interdependence of all New Yorkers, pledging to help the poor and other disadvantaged people yet at the same time to be fiscally responsible.\nThe point of the second inaugural, the Governor said, was to show that he had held true to that pledge in his first term and would continue to do so in his second. Pointed to Tax Cut\n''Some approved of the words that I used,'' Mr. Cuomo said, referring to the 1983 inaugural, ''but said that four years of actual governance would show them to be unrealistic, perhaps just poetry. But now, four years later, having applied those ideas to the task of serving this wonderful state of nearly 18 million people, I believe it all, even more assuredly and passionately than I did then.''\nAs evidence that he had held to his pledge, the Governor pointed out that he had enacted a tax cut and balanced the state budget, while increasing welfare payments and shelter and nutrition programs for the poor.\nIn an interview, Mr. Cuomo was asked about the similarity of the themes of his speeches, particularly the two inaugurals.\n''We all learn things, of course,'' he said. ''But I started in this business when I was already mature. I didn't begin to form my philosophy with my public life. My philosophy was formed when I began my public life. There's no need to find a new approach, to shift to the left or shift to the right.\n''Read Lincoln's second inaugural from 1865. It said, 'I told you in 1861 what I believed.' '' Critical of Federal Deficit\nIn his nationwide references, the Governor was critical of the budget deficit, of the imbalance in trade, of unemployment and of what he sees as a failure to deal with the needs of the poor. But as in the past, Mr. Cuomo, a frequent opponent of Reagan Administration policies, did not propose specific alternatives.\nThat has drawn him criticism over the last year. But the Governor said in the interview that the purpose of an inaugural was to talk of philosophy, not specifics. In the address, he described a country of ''miracles'' in which millions needlessly lived in despair.\n''We can see more and more elderly living in fear of destitution and abandonment,'' he said. ''We can hear the eloquent cries of America's religious leaders, including the Catholic bishops most recently, on behalf of the voiceless poor.'' Emotional Ending\nIn an emotional ending, as if talking directly to the Statue of Liberty, he continued:\n''Lift your lamp, Lady. Lift it to those you've always welcomed. To the lonely and the friendless, to all the members of the human family the world so often finds it convenient to ignore, to despise, even to persecute.\n''Lift it for our brothers and sisters in this country, for the farm families and factory workers who are fighting to hold on to their farms and their jobs and their dignity.\n''And lift your lamp, as well, for the fortunate among us,'' he went on a bit later. ''For the well fed, for the well educated, for the satisfied. Don't let us forget who we are and where we came from and what your promise had pledged us to.''

Kunstler.\nThe murder trial here of two self-avowed revolutionaries has attracted a high school criminal-justice class that has been studying the defense tactics of the lawyer William M. Kunstler.\nRoger Shutack, the teacher of the class, from Voorhees High School in Glen Gardner, about 20 miles from here in Hunterdon County, said the juniors and seniors had been studying Mr. Kunstler's defense of radicals in this and other cases. One of the cases was the trial of the so-called Chicago 7, who were charged with conspiring to start a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\nMeeting the students in the hall outside the courtroom, Mr. Kunstler said that the politics of the defendants in this case, Thomas W. Manning and Richard C. Williams, should not matter in the verdict. The defense maintains that Mr. Manning, who Mr. Kunstler represents, killed State Trooper Philip J. Lamonaco in self-defense, and that Mr. Williams was not involved in the shooting, five years ago on Interstate 80.\n''They are revolutionaries,'' Mr Kunstler said of the clients. ''They want a different system of government in America. They have strong political feelings. They're anti-government, believe me, in every sense of the word.''\nBut, he said, ''self-defense is a legitimate defense'' and the only issue is what happened in the brief confrontation at the scene of the shooting.\n''Our area is very conservative,'' Mr. Shatuck said later. ''Most of the parents don't like Mr. Kunstler. Many of the kids feel the same. But we're trying to show both sides, keep an open mind and have the students do so too.''\nThe oft-moved trial of the two revolutionaries will move again when testimony resumes Monday.\nMr. Manning and Mr. Williams went on trial for murder at the Somerville Elks Club on Nov. 10.\nTestimony was then heard in the tiny courtroom of Judge Michael R. Imbriani of Superior Court in an annex of the Somerset County Courthouse until Judge Imbriani moved the trial yesterday to larger quarters in the courthouse across the street, which was built in 1906. With Mr. Manning on the stand that day, the judge borrowed a courtroom empty for the holidays to accommodate the expected crowd.\nAn audience of 200 people, many of whom stood in line for more than an hour to go through metal detectors and get passes to enter, heard the bearded 40-year-old defendant, speaking rapidly in the accent of his native Boston, testify that he killed the trooper in self-defense after first being shot at.\nBut the big courtroom is no longer available to Judge Imbriani, and the trial will return to the annex, where the courtroom seats 24 spectators. With Mr. Manning resuming testimony, some visitors may not get in, even to a second annex courtroom, where proceedings can be watched on closed-circuit television.\nThere may be yet another move. To accommodate audience demand to hear the lawyers' summations, expected about Jan. 12, the judge told the jury the trial may go back to a big meeting room in the Elks Club.\n''I'm probably the only judge in the history of New Jersey who ever conducted a trial under a mounted elk's head,'' Judge Imbriani said in an interview.\nMr. Williams, also a bearded native of Massachusetts, is not expected to testify. His lawyer, Lynne Stewart, has said he was with other members of the Armed Clandestine Movement when the shooting occurred and does not want to implicate them under cross-examination, because it might subject them to charges of harboring a fugitive.\nBoth Mr. Manning and the only other member of the underground group to testify so far, Raymond Luc Levasseur, refused to answer most questions about the organization, its activities and its members.\nWhile warrants had been issued for the arrest of both defendants on other charges at the time of the shooting, the defense avoids the word ''fugitive'' as prejudicial.\n''They say fugitivity,'' Mr. Kunstler said of the prosecution during one colloquy. ''We call it clandestinity.''\n''It's a free country,'' said the judge.\nWith no witness to identify Mr. Williams as having been present at the scene of the shooting, the state has offered circumstantial evidence that includes the testimony of 67 witnesses and 449 exhibits.\nOne of the last items to be offered in evidence before the state rested its case was a photograph of the kitchen sink at the Pennsylvania farmhouse Mr. Williams shared with Mr. Manning and his family at the time of the shooting.\n''Now they have everything in,'' Ms. Stewart said. Judge Imbriani has delayed a decision on whether one item will be admitted to the jury deliberation room. It is the bullet-riddled uniform jacket of Trooper Lamonaco, displayed on a headless mannequin.\n''It would be a brooding presence,'' said Mr. Kunstler, objecting.\nThe prosecutor, Deputy Attorney General Anthony G. Simonetti, drew the court's attention one recent day when he reported contact with one of the women on the unsequestered jury the previous midnight at a motel lounge.\nThe judge sent the rest of the jury out of the room and questioned the woman about the incident. ''We just said hello,'' she said. That satisfied the judge.

Richards, said in a telephone interview from Charlotte, N.C. ''A bullet could ricochet, kill the pilot, the plane comes down and 200 people are dead.''\nMr. Richards said that no arrests had been made and that F.B.I. agents and the local authorities were continuing their search for clues at the airport and in the surrounding area. He declined to give details of the investigation or to say whether the authorities had found any evidence that the shooting was intentional. He also would not say whether the investigators knew what kind of gun had been used.\nThe shooting occurred about 5:25 P.M., two miles south of the airport, as United Flight 1502, a Boeing 737, approached the airport on a flight from Wilmington, N.C. There were 16 passengers and five crew members aboard. Victim in Stable Condition\nThe bullet pierced the belly of the plane and struck Barry Rollins, 30 years old, of New York City. It passed through his right thigh and lodged in his left cheek. The bullet was removed Wednesday night and Mr. Rollins was in stable condition at Rex Hospital in Raleigh, according to a nursing supervisor there.\nThe shooting brought renewed calls for curbs on hunting and the use of firearms in Wake County, particularly in areas near the airport.\n''It is just another in a long list of cases that points out to me that we need to do something about the county gun ordinances,'' Merrie R. Hedrick, a Wake County commissioner, said. ''It would certainly seem to me that if people were shooting that close by, it was just a question of when something would happen.''\nBut G. Eric Shuford, president of the Sir Walter Raleigh Gun Club, said he did not believe additional gun restrictions were needed.\n''Whoever perpetrated such an act should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,'' Mr. Shuford said. ''Don't restrict all the responsible hunters and responsible firearm owners because of one stupid act by one person.'' Hunting in Nearby Park\nMr. Shuford said people often hunted near the airport and in nearby William B. Umstead State Park. ''There's a lot of woods out there,'' he said. ''That's a fairly decent hunting area for deer, squirrel and rabbit.''\nHe added that almost any high-powered rifle could have been used in the shooting and that many deer hunters used such rifles.\nUnited Airlines flew several members of the victim's family to Raleigh, said Matt P. Gonring, a spokesman for the company. He said the airline was paying for Mr. Rollins's medical care.\nA man who answered the phone in Mr. Rollins's hospital room and identified himself as a family friend said Mr. Rollins was ''doing fine.'' He said Mr. Rollins had not been able to talk much about the incident.\nMr. Richards of the F.B.I. said he was concerned that the incident might prompt similar acts.\n''We've got so many wackos in the world, you never know,'' he said. ''It would be a tragic thing. I just hope it doesn't give any loonies out there an idea.''

Delmonico, 28 years old, was listed in satisfactory condition at Bellevue Hospital.\nHe had been returning home to West Islip, L.I., on a Long Island Rail Road train after a 13-hour overtime shift with the mounted patrol at the New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square. The shooting occurred about 6 A.M. on a train bound for Babylon that was crowded with revelers. Station Sealed Off\nMoments after the shooting, the L.I.R.R. police, with the help of scores of on-duty and off-duty Amtrak and New York City police officers, sealed off the station and conducted a search that led to the arrest of five youths on charges ranging from attempted murder to possession of cocaine.\nAt a news conference yesterday, the Manhattan detective commander, Assistant Chief Anthony M. Voelker, said the dispute broke out when Officer Delmonico told a group of youths not to smoke in a nonsmoking car. After the officer exchanged sharp words with the youths, one of them pulled out a .25-caliber Beretta automatic pistol and shot him once in the face at point-blank range.\nThe bullet entered above his right jaw and exited just below his left ear, the police said. No passengers were hit, and the bullet that struck Officer Delmonico was apparently the only shot fired. Chief Voelker said Officer Delmonico, who has been on the police force since 1983, did not identify himself as a police officer initially, but showed his badge and drew his gun after he was shot.\nAt that point, the youths fled, with Officer Delmonico in pursuit. Chief Voelker said some youths scattered along the platform or to other cars, while others dashed up the stairs to the lobby and into the bustling terminal.\nWith blood streaming from his wounds, Officer Delmonico chased his assailants up the stairs to the lobby, where he collapsed. By that time, police officers were responding to a bulletin over the station's public-address system to assist the wounded officer. Suspects Apprehended\nScores of officers sealed off the building and apprehended several suspects in the terminal, on the platform and on the train, in some cases with the assistance of stunned passengers who saw the shooting and were watching the ensuing drama from the platform.\nArrested and charged in the shooting were Thomas Berry, 19, who was charged with attempted murder; Kenny Hardy, 19, possession of a gun and of 35 packets of what the police believed to be cocaine and 15 packets of marijuana; Eugene Frederick, 17, possession of a spring-loaded switch-blade; Andrew Henry, 17, and Lavane Beard, 16, both charged with possession of brass knuckles with built-in four-inch switch-blades. All of the youths live in Amityville, L.I., except Mr. Beard, who lives in Wyndanch, L.I.\nA youth who had been smoking was not arrested. He was not identified.\nAbout 200 passengers on the train, which was scheduled to leave Penn Station at 6:10 A.M. and arrive at Babylon at 7:21 A.M., were kept on board for questioning until about 10 A.M.\nThe incident yesterday was the first shooting at Penn Station since February 1984, when a sniper shot and killed an Amtrak engineer as he walked along the platform between Tracks 20 and 21, the same area where yesterday's shooting occurred.
380	TO SOME, DAVIS IS 'HERO' AMID ATTACKS ON BLACKS	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D91331F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: As Larry Davis was led away from a Bronx housing project in manacles Dec. 7, dozens of tenants leaned out their windows to chant ''Lar-ry! Lar-ry!,'' cheering the man accused of wounding six police officers the way they might a boxer stepping into the ring.\nAs Larry Davis was led away from a Bronx housing project in manacles Dec. 7, dozens of tenants leaned out their windows to chant ''Lar-ry! Lar-ry!,'' cheering the man accused of wounding six police officers the way they might a boxer stepping into the ring.\nNow, four weeks later, those exhortations have proven to be more than an initial, spontaneous reaction. Representatives from various segments of the black community say that Mr. Davis is regarded as, if not a folk hero for his violent actions and success in evading a massive manhunt for 17 days, at least an embodiment of their festering frustration with the police.\nLike the recent beatings of three blacks by a gang of whites in Howard Beach, Queens, say even those black leaders who disdain Mr. Davis, the reaction to his arrest has discomfitingly drawn attention to the state of race relations in New York City.\nIn talking about Mr. Davis during interviews and in forums ranging from radio talk shows to private conversations, many blacks mention not only the Howard Beach incident but also the Bernhard H. Goetz case and the killings by the police of Eleanor Bumpurs and the death of Michael Stewart. Police Assailed on Crime\nAnd though many blacks assail the police for being unduly harsh, they also criticize them for not cracking down harshly enough on the pervasive street crime in poor neighborhoods. Either way, it can spell hostility and even a desire for vengeance.\n''It should've been expected that the things Larry Davis did would make him a folk hero,'' said Claude Brown, the author of ''Manchild in the Promised Land,'' an autobiographical account of his upbringing in Harlem. ''The white police department has been intimidating the black community -think of Eleanor Bumpurs and Michael Stewart - and all of a sudden here comes Larry Davis the avenging angel. It's like, 'We finally won one.' '' As Mr. Brown's comments suggest, the support for Mr. Davis, or what he is believed to symbolize, does not come only from the poorest blacks. Rather, it seems to cut across lines of class.\n''The overwhelming response for Davis is positive,'' said Gary Byrd, the host of a daily talk show on the radio station WLIB, which has a large black audience. ''And I'm hearing that from thoughtful, rational kinds of people. Even those with reservations speak with understanding. People would say, 'I don't agree with shooting people, but he did take care of himself.' '' Respect in Black Community\nL L Cool J, a best-selling rap musician, said he has heard similar comments in Hollis, Queens, the black middle-class neighborhood where he lives.\n''Incredibly enough, a lot of people respect him,'' he said. ''He did something brave. Whether it was right or wrong doesn't matter to a lot of people. They looked at Larry Davis and said, 'That guy's bad.' Like Tony Dorsett or something. Personally, I don't support what he did, but I'm telling you what's passed my ears.''\nMany blacks, to be sure, abhor Mr. Davis's actions. ''Our students were saying, 'This guy is crazy,' '' said Jimmie Warren, of Taft High School in the Bronx. ''There was not a sense of his bravado, but a sense of disbelief.''\nMatthew Kaye, a gypsy-cab driver who lives two blocks from the housing project where Mr. Davis was caught, said: ''I call him an enemy of society. Because anybody involved against a law-enforcement agent should be prosecuted and punished. And he's been committing a lot of crimes.''\nYet any support for Mr. Davis is more striking precisely because of the criminal record he had before his shoot-out with the police Nov. 19. Even if that act was perceived in some quarters as heroic resistance to the authorities, it was preceded by arrests for attempted murder, assault, grand larceny, petty larceny and possession of a hypodermic instrument. Davis Held in Slayings\nThe police officers whom Mr. Davis shot had come to arrest him for the murders of four suspected drug dealers - killings the police have said were not vigilante attempts to drive narcotics out of the neighborhood but were made solely to steal the illicit profits.\nImmediately after Mr. Davis shot the arresting officers, a small network of friends and relatives willing to help him began to build, along with a kind of cult status. Mr. Davis was able to dodge a 150-officer manhunt for 17 days, earning the street sobriquet ''the dude that elude.''\nHe was captured only after the initial reward money of $15,000 was raised to $25,000, and an estranged brother-in-law came forward with information about Mr. Davis's whereabouts. (The police say the reward cannot be claimed until Mr. Davis is convicted, and that, even then, they will not release the name of the recipient for fear he might be harmed.) Negotiated Terms of Arrest Most important to many blacks, Mr. Davis negotiated the terms of his arrest so that he was taken alive, with reporters and camera crews on hand. ''When I was growing up,'' Mr. Brown, the author, said, ''if someone shot a cop they got killed in prison. If they ever got to prison.''\nThe adulation of a violent criminal such as Mr. Davis begins with the American national character, criminologists say, and is heightened by the subculture of the black ghetto. The final step in the process, some blacks in New York say, is the specific ill will between the police and the black community in the city.\n''In American history, there has always been a romanticism about the gunman, going back down to Billy the Kid, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde,'' said Marvin E. Wolfgang, a professor of criminology and law at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. ''There's something involved in the wishes, desires, fantasies that people can't express directly but can vicariously through other people or fictional characters.''\nIn his scholarship, Professor Wolfgang has identified America's black ghettos as one of several ''cultural pockets'' in which ''the ready resort to physical violence is not only tolerated but encouraged - and in some situations even required.'' His other examples included Sicilian, Sardinian and Colombian societies.\nMany residents of American black ghettos, Professor Wolfgang said, share the national aspiration for status and material comfort, but feel unable to reach them through conventional routes because of discrimination and diminished opportunities. Violent behavior is an attempt to get the goods through other means, means that can become the subculture's norms, he said. 'People Respect Strength'\nProfessor Wolfgang's conclusion is consistent with much of the reaction to Mr. Davis. ''People respect strength, respect guts,'' L L Cool J said. ''It's like power rules.'' Claude Brown made a similar point in writing about Harlem three years ago in The New York Times magazine:\n''Prison, and doing 'bits' (time), has strangely ambivalent, perhaps even pervertedly romanticized appeal to poor black teen-agers. It is viewed as an inevitability, or at least a probability, accompanied by nothing more than the mild apprehension or anxiety that attends, for instance, a bar mitzvah, joining the Marines or any other manhood initiation ritual in any normal society. One goes into the Marines as a young boy and comes out a 'real man.' It is the same with going into the 'joint,' as prison is called.''\nThe Davis incident also occurred within a specific context - a series of fatal encounters between the police and blacks that became the flashpoints for their relations.\nIn 1983, Michael Stewart was arrested on charges of painting graffiti in the Union Square subway station. Within an hour, he was taken to Bellevue Hospital with various injuries, of which he died 13 days later. The police officers who arrested Mr. Stewart were acquitted by a jury of any wrongdoing in his death.\nOne year after the Stewart case, a police officer armed with a shotgun killed Eleanor Bumpurs, a Bronx woman being evicted from her apartment. Mrs. Bumpurs, the police said, was threatening the officers with a kitchen knife. The case has yet to go to trial. Similar Status for Goetz\nAlthough it did not involve the police, the Goetz case also figured into several observers's comments about Mr. Davis. In late 1984, Mr. Goetz shot four black men who he said were preparing to rob him on a subway. Like Mr. Davis, he attained a kind of folk hero status - the one man who stood up to street crime.\n''All these cases have impacted on the community,'' Mr. Byrd of WLIB said. ''And with Larry Davis, it was almost another classic example of black people being victimized by the police. But Davis was able to survive.'' A middle-aged woman who lives in the housing project where Mr. Davis was arrested, and who asked not to be identified by name, said: ''Maybe people liked Larry Davis because we're black and we've seen and heard the things cops do to people with their guns and their authority. I don't justify what he did. But I did pray for him. He didn't kill any of those cops, and he was just protecting himself.''\nBut there is also a second side to the relationship between inner-city blacks and the police.\n''The reason black people feel the police are the enemy is because of the service they get,'' said Detective Roger Abel, president of the Guardians Association, an organization of 2,000 black police officers in New York City. ''You go to a place like 124th and Lenox or 118th and 8th, and you see prostitutes and junkies hanging around. You don't get that on Park Avenue or in Riverdale. And there's no way you can tell me the police can't get those people off the street.''\nThe criminal charges against Mr. Davis stemming from the shoot-out remain to be adjudicated. But in the meantime, the reaction to him in parts of the black community has created its own tensions - ones that many blacks say have only been heightened by the racial attack in Howard Beach.\n''There is a very definite militancy developing,'' Mr. Byrd, the radio host, said. ''It has not been this way since the 60's.''

383	U.S. TRIMS CHIP PRICES OF JAPANESE	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D81331F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: For the second quarter in a row, the Commerce Department has lowered the minimum prices at which Japanese manufacturers can sell their computer chips in the United States, according to analysts and industry sources.\nFor the second quarter in a row, the Commerce Department has lowered the minimum prices at which Japanese manufacturers can sell their computer chips in the United States, according to analysts and industry sources.\nThe changes make the Japanese more competitive at a time when American producers still accuse them of unfair trade practices. The American industry has begun to climb back after a long slump.\nThe price reductions, while not as sharp as those at the end of September, range from 8.3 percent on Eproms, or erasable programmable read-only memory chips, to 40.9 percent on one megabit chips. They took effect yesterday.\nThe ''fair market'' prices were established under a trade agreement between the United States and Japan that was intended to prevent the Japanese from dumping - selling chips below cost. Initial Prices High\nWhen the agreement went into effect in July, the Commerce Department set prices artificially high because it did not have complete information on Japanese production costs, analysts said.\nAs the Japanese provided information on their costs and also began producing more chips, the prices started to decline.\nThe prices are not made public by the Commerce Department. The Japanese Government is notified of the prices and passes the information on to Japanese manufacturers.\nIndustry sources said the department had lowered the minimum prices for 256K D-RAM's, or dynamic random access memory chips, by 50 cents, to $2.50. The average minimum price for Eproms was lowered 50 cents, to $5.50.\nThe largest decline in prices was for the one megabit chip, which has four times the memory density of the 256K D-RAM. Its price was set at $13, down 40.9 percent, from $22 last quarter, the sources said. Previous Reduction of 50%\nIn October, according to industry sources, the prices set for the last three months of 1986 were reduced by about 50 percent from those set in July.\nJapanese companies can sell their chips at or above the fair market value. United States makers can sell their chips at any price.\nDespite the agreement, American chip makers have charged that the Japanese are continuing to dump chips in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and in other developing economies, where major semiconductor customers can buy them at substantially lower prices.\nMany analysts view such dumping and plummeting fair market values as evidence that the semiconductor agreement - which was supposed to eliminate dumping and eventually raise prices - has been a failure.\n''The agreement, the whole context of protecting the industry, has been a farce because it's almost impossible to implement and monitor it,'' said Richard Whittington, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.\nThe problem, analysts said, is that there are too many opportunities to circumvent the agreement. Many Japanese companies have established trading companies or stand-alone operations in emerging countries that can buy chips at the cheaper home prices and resell them, they added.\nIndustry sources speak of what they call ''the Korean shell game.'' They say Japanese companies sell chips to Korean companies at fair-market-value prices, then offer a rebate equal to the difference between the official and home price. ''Legally it looks like the chip is going out at a higher price,'' Mr. Whittington said.\nAs a result, many electronics companies in the United States have moved their manufacturing operations overseas to take advantage of lower chip prices, labor costs and taxes. 'Significant Difficulties'\nWhile acknowledging ''significant difficulties in the agreement,'' Roger Bolton, a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative, said it was premature to term the agreement a failure. ''We have effectively prevented dumping in the United States and prices are higher than they were before the agreement,'' he said.\nSheridan Tatsuno, an analyst for Data Quest, a technology research firm in San Jose, Calif., agreed with Mr. Bolton, noting the price of computer chips would be significantly lower had the agreement not gone into effect, because of the recession in the industry and the new capacity from Korea companies.\nMr. Bolton said the Trade Representative had achieved a commitment from the Japanese Government to prevent some of the dumping in developing nations. He said and the two Governments would hold discussions on the matter in Tokyo later this month.

385	STOCK STRENGTH PREDICTED...WITH HEAVY BOND DEMAND	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D81331F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: With bond yields falling to their lowest level in about nine years, corporate treasurers displayed an awesome appetite for borrowing in 1986. More than $200 billion of new bonds were issued, twice the record set in 1985.\nWith bond yields falling to their lowest level in about nine years, corporate treasurers displayed an awesome appetite for borrowing in 1986. More than $200 billion of new bonds were issued, twice the record set in 1985.\nAnd with bond rates expected to remain at those low levels, investment bankers predict that corporations will continue to flock - although in smaller numbers - to the market. Although many analysts forecast lower rates for early 1987, they acknowledge that the drop should not be as precipitous as the 2-percentage-point decline early last year, and some warn that rates might rise modestly late in 1987.\nEven so, securities dealers say that the catalysts for new corporate bond sales will be the same as last year: Corporate treasurers and local government officials remain eager to refinance bonds that were sold when interest rates were higher, and Wall Street financiers are still looking to the bond market as a key source of financing for mergers, acquisitions and corporate restructurings.\nAnalysts at Salomon Brothers estimate that new corporate bond issues, after subtracting bonds that are refinanced, might total about $84 billion in 1987, down slightly from the record $90.9 billion in 1986. A Record in 'Junk Bonds'\nApart from the activity stimulated by lower interest rates, a record $32.5 billion of high-yield ''junk bond'' financing was arranged last year. Although other Wall Street firms are devoting more resources to arranging sales of these speculative bond issues, Drexel Burnham Lambert continues to dominate the market.\nBut even though Drexel's dominance of the junk bond market has elevated the firm into the ranks of the top 10 underwriters, its other underwriting activities fall short of the industry leaders. The First Boston Corporation, combined with Credit Suisse First Boston, its international affiliate, continues as the leading underwriter of debt securities, followed by Salomon Brothers, which is the largest firm in the American debt market.\nThe growth of the market for high-yield, low-quality bonds has gone hand in hand with investors' growing appetite for such issues.\nAlthough some analysts, such as Edward Altman, a New York University professor, warn that a recession could ''cause higher rates of default than anything we have seen in the past,'' such warnings have not discouraged purchases of junk bonds by large investors.\nThose mutual funds and insurance companies are eager to continue earning the double-digit rates of the early 1980's, and for now, they seem satisfied that interest rates of 13 percent and more on junk bonds are high enough to compensate for the risk of default and the fact that junk bond prices do not rise as much as Treasury bonds when interest rates are falling.\nOf course, with yields of high- and medium-quality bonds at about their lowest levels in nine years, traditional bond financings to repay short-term debt or raise funds for expansion will continue. A few hundred of the nation's largest corporations have already filed shelf registration statements for more than $150 billion of securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission, thereby clearing the way for a quick sale whenever market conditions are auspicious.\n''The absolute level of rates was attractive last year,'' said Donald S. Howard, chief financial officer at Citicorp. That institution borrowed in the domestic long-term debt market last year - with two issues totaling $400 million - for the first time since 1980.\nAlthough acknowledging that the low interest rates will continue to tempt corporate treasurers, Mr. Howard noted: ''For the time being, we are like someone who just ate a large meal. Our appetite is reduced.'' Index Watching Will Continue\nAmong investors, one 1986 trend that is sure to continue is the tendency to manage portfolios with the aim of equaling the performance of one of the indexes now compiled by securities dealers. Since only about a fourth of portfolio managers outperform the market, more pension funds and other institutions are directing their fund managers to match an index, rather than trying to outperform the market by guessing which way interest rates will move.\n''The search now is for securities that will outperform the various bond market indexes, whether rates rise or fall,'' said H. Dean Benner, a managing director at Chase Investors Management Corporation.\nThe mortgage securities market is one of the most fertile areas for custom-designed securities that meet the needs of investors such as Mr. Benner. After the introduction last year of stripped mortgage-backed securities - where principal and interest payments of outstanding mortgage securities were reallocated among two new securities - and floating rate collateralized mortgage obligations, investors can expect even more diversity in 1987. New Generation of Securities\nNew Federal legislation allowing real estate mortgage investment conduits has cleared the way for a new generation of mortgage-backed securities that were not possible under previous tax laws. Analysts at Salomon Brothers, the leading firm in mortgage-backed securities financing, noted that these real estate conduits will lead to a proliferation of mortgage securities, including some whose credit quality will be far lower than the triple-A level that is now standard in the mortgage market.\nElsewhere in the mortgage market, officials at Salomon Brothers said in its ''Prospects for Financial Markets in 1987'' that yields on mortgage pass-through securities - which rose sharply compared with Treasury bonds in 1986 - may decline relative to Treasury issues this year. Prepayments of mortgages should not continue at the same rapid rate as last year, and the supply of new mortgage securities should be reduced as homeowners finish refinancing old, high-interest mortgages.\nIn the municipal bond market, the new Federal tax law was the most prominent development of the year, helping to shrink the supply of new tax-exempt bonds to about $143.5 billion in 1986 from $200 billion in 1985, according to IDD Information Services.\nIn the coming year, investment bankers expect the amount of new financing to contract slightly. The new tax law limits the amount of financing for housing and other projects undertaken in cooperation with, or on behalf of, private businesses. To cope with the new limits on tax-exempt financings, securities dealers are preparing for an increase in taxable bond sales by local governments from the $4.4 billion of such issues that was sold last year.\nFor investors, the most confusing aspect of the new tax law is the possibility that interest on some kinds of bonds, such as those for housing and student loans, may be subject to the personal alternative minimum income tax. Because that tax will generally apply only to individuals with large amounts of tax shelters or other preference items, interest on those bonds subject to the tax will still be tax-exempt for many investors.\n''I'm telling people to take advantage of the other guy's minimum tax problem, and buy these new bonds with the higher yields,'' said James Lebenthal, president of a New York municipal bond firm bearing his name.\nRecent issues of bonds subject to the alternative minimum tax have been yielding about half a percentage point more than bonds of similar quality and maturity that are not subject to the tax.
386	BRITISH PARTIES ENGAGED IN A NEW COMPETITION	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED81331F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Sometime this year, unless every political pundit here is mistaken, the British Government will call a general election, sending the parties out to do battle armed with their conflicting ideologies, exhortations and promises. But in recent weeks, Britain's two big parties have been engaged in a competition of a different sort - selling holiday gifts to the party faithful.\nSometime this year, unless every political pundit here is mistaken, the British Government will call a general election, sending the parties out to do battle armed with their conflicting ideologies, exhortations and promises. But in recent weeks, Britain's two big parties have been engaged in a competition of a different sort - selling holiday gifts to the party faithful.\nWith glossy catalogues and slick promotions, the Conservative and Labor parties have been pressing their politically inspired wares on their constituents. The holiday-season campaign marks the first real venture into professional mail-order merchandising by British political parties, and their offerings and marketing philosophies are as different as the parties themselves.\nOn the Left, the Labor Party has its ''Putting People First'' hip flask, which one commentator praised as ''ideal for keeping out the chill on winter picket duty or for the traditional Boxing Day fox-hunt saboteurs.'' Another big seller among the 50 some items offered is a cute mohair teddy bear clad in a vest proclaiming, ''I'm a Red Ted.'' 'An Essential Requirement'\nThe Labor Party's catalogue dubs its sturdy red-and-yellow umbrella ''the activist's friend,'' adding that it is ''an essential requirement for wet weather campaigning.'' For the truly devout, Labor offers a framed color picture of its leader, Neil Kinnock. The teddy bears have outsold the Neil Kinnock photos four to one.\nOn the Right, the Tories take a different approach. Their goods are less blatantly political and, not surprisingly, somewhat more up-market than Labor's merchandise. True, there is the ''I Love Maggie'' T-shirt - a reference to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, of course. But mostly, the Conservatives are offering items such as Wedgwood after-dinner mint trays and well-stocked food hampers. The top-of-the-line ''Lords Hamper,'' selling for $95, is chocked full of snacks and libations ranging from port and sherry to royal game soup and English brandy snaps.\nNot only the products, but also the thinking behind the two campaigns is worlds apart. ''Ours isn't propoganda,'' said Grahame Waterman, the 42-year-old director of the Conservative party's marketing arm. ''The average Conservative doesn't want to look like a walking political advertisement, with party slogans plastered all over him.''\nBy contrast, the Labor campaign is unabashedly ideological. ''We're looking to promote political ideas, not just sell goods,'' notes Steve Billcliffe, Labor's 36-year-old marketing manager.\nOne intriguing aspect of the Labor promotion is sheer volume of fire-engine red as the color on its towels, running shirts, sports bags, checkbooks, key cases, unbrellas and other merchandise. This comes at a time when Mr. Kinnock has tried to curb the influence of the red-brandishing extremists in his party to broaden Labor's appeal. Profits Are Big\nMr. Billcliffe defends the choice of so much scarlet with a free-market argument that would do Adam Smith proud. ''from a purely commercial point of view, we wanted to offer something for everyone,'' Mr. Billcliffe said, noting that the party has activists who ''like to wave a lot of red'' as well as moderates like Mr. Kinnock.\nThe Labor marketing effort tends to refute Tory claims that their adversaries are wild-eyed leftists who would make profit a dirty word. Mr. Billcliffe estimates that on sales counted to date, the Labor merchandising program has turned a profit of roughly $30,000 on revenues of $90,000 - a profit margin so high that the likes of Lord Hanson of Hanson Trust PLC or Sir John Egan of Jaguar could hardly dream of equaling it.\nAll this Mr. Billcliffe regards with unflappable pragmatism. ''There's nothing wrong with mixing capitalist venture with a socialist end product,'' he says.\nFor all Labor's success, the Conservatives have sold more than twice as much, with revenues reaching $220,000. And based on the unaudited figures to date, it appears that in the marketplace, Mrs. Thatcher is winning the personality contest against Mr. Kinnock, since there have been about four times as many ''I Love Maggie'' T-shirts sold as Neil Kinnock photographs.\nInformed of these results, the Conservative party's Mr. Waterman replied, ''So what else is new?''\nBy the same reckoning, the sales figures place Mrs. Thatcher, who will soon become the longest-serving British prime minister since Winston Churchill, about neck-and-neck with the Labor teddy bear - and perhaps a slight edge to the teddy bear.

389	RANGERS GET CARPENTER FROM CAPITALS	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD71331F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Bobby Carpenter, once the franchise centerpiece and superstar center for the Washington Capitals, finally received a job offer from the Rangers yesterday in a deal that brought Carpenter and a second-round 1987 draft pick to New York.\nBobby Carpenter, once the franchise centerpiece and superstar center for the Washington Capitals, finally received a job offer from the Rangers yesterday in a deal that brought Carpenter and a second-round 1987 draft pick to New York.\nIn exchange, the Rangers sent to Washington three forwards - Mike Ridley, their second leading scorer this season; Kelly Miller, who has 6 goals and 14 assists, and Bob Crawford, who scored 36 goals for Hartford three seasons ago.\nThe Rangers also picked up the final two years of Carpenter's contract, described by General Manager Phil Esposito of the Rangers as ''intricate'' and worth an estimated $400,000 a year.\nThe trade concluded an episode known as ''our personal soap opera'' by Capitals players who wondered why a last-place Patrick Division team chose to let Carpenter, who once produced a 53-goal season for them, sit and collect his pay but not play for more than a month.\nIt also ended a monthlong pursuit of the player by Esposito, who held out until yesterday morning for the Capitals to include a second-round draft pick in the Carpenter package.\nEsposito had no qualms about exchanging Ridley and also Crawford, a player he believed wouldn't rate a position on the Ranger club, for Carpenter. But he demanded the draft position in exchange for Miller.\n''I've been interested in Bobby Carpenter for the past month or so,'' said Esposito from his home yesterday, ''but things didn't really get happening until this morning. It's been a wild day, and I'm excited about this.''\nCarpenter will join the team today and is expected to play tomorrow night in Quebec. The 23-year-old Capitals center was considered the most attractive schoolboy hockey prospect the United States had ever produced when the Capitals got him in the 1981 entry draft. They selected Carpenter, who is from Beverly, Mass., just ahead of Hartford's position.\nCarpenter went directly from prep school to the National Hockey League and appeared to savor the transition, especially in 1984-85, when he became the first United States-born player to score 50 or more goals in a season. But since then, his squabbles with the Capitals' coach, Bryan Murray, escalated and his goal production plunged.\nIn November, after a meeting with the Washington general manager, David Poile, failed to soothe the controversy, Poile encouraged Carpenter to agree to a trade, which he did. The next day Poile also telephoned Carpenter to tell him not to report to practice because, on the trading block or not, his services were no longer required.\nPoile was originally asking a higher price for Carpenter, but as the weeks went by and there were no takers, he adjusted his requirements.\n''I look at him as a 50 goal-scorer, the other G.M.'s see him as a qualified 30 goal-scorer, so I guess the truth may lie someplace in the middle,'' Poile said. According to Esposito, there's no reason to worry about Carpenter's reputation for being hard to manage.\n''I know enough of the story there to know it won't be a problem for us,'' he said. ''Right from the start, Bobby and Mr. Murray didn't get along. They were playing him at left wing, and that's not where he belongs. He'll play center for us. Anyway, I was the worst temperamental player there ever was, so I'm not worried about him.''\nEsposito said Carpenter's position as the club's No. 1 center was not automatically guaranteed. ''He'll have to earn his way there, and he realizes that. Bobby doesn't intend to get prima donna treatment from us.''\nTom Webster, the Ranger coach, called Carpenter a quality player, and said: ''At first, I thought it was an awful lot to give up, but when you're getting a player like Carpenter, that's the price.''\nRidley, a 23-year-old center in his second year with the Rangers, has 16 goals and 20 assists, after a rookie season in which he scored 22 goals and added 43 assists.

Among them are the Sir Francis Drake in San Francisco, the Barclay in Philadelphia, the Dupont Plaza in Washington, and several hotels in southern California.\nOne person familiar with Hotel Systems said it owned the San Juan hotel, the Dupont Plaza, through a separate corporation. No further details about this or Hotel Systems, which is privately held, were immediately available. Hotel Systems executives were said to be in San Juan or on their way there, and calls to the company's headquarters in Santa Monica were not answered. Previously a Sheraton\nHotel Systems acquired the Washington Dupont in 1977, and the San Juan hotel was described as being part of that purchase. Before that, the San Juan hotel had been operated as a Sheraton.\nThe fire at the M-G-M Grand, on Nov. 21, 1980, killed 84 hotel employees and guests and injured 700 others. The fire prompted lawsuits against the hotel seeking more than $2 billion in compensatory and punitive damages. Most of the suits were later settled for a total of about $105 million.\nAt the time of the fire, the M-G-M Grand had $30 million in liability insurance. It later bought $170 million in retroactive insurance.\nIt could not be learned how much insurance is carried by Hotel Systems or the affiliated corporation said to own the San Juan hotel. The cost of liability insurance has increased dramatically in recent years in what has been described as an explosion in liability lawsuits and subsequent damage awards. Prospects of Litigation\nLawyers who have handled cases stemming from similar situations said it was virtually certain that suits would be brought against the hotel's owner, and possibly against the structure's builders and designers. But the course of any litigation, they said, depends on what the cause of the fire is determined to be.\nIf, for example, investigators find that the blaze was set by arsonists, it would diminish the liability of the hotel's owner, though probably not eliminate it entirely, lawyers said.\n''You can assume there will be litigation,'' said Neil G. Galatz, a Las Vegas lawyer who represented plaintiffs in the M-G-M Grand fire and in other cases.\nMr. Galatz said any suits stemming from the San Juan fire would probably center on its cause of the blaze, how well equipped the hotel was to deal with fire, and how well designed the structure was. Property Damage in Millions\nGov. Rafael Hernandez Colon said yesterday that the Puerto Rican fire code did not require sprinklers in hotels and that none was present in the Dupont Plaza.\nIt could not be determined today how much property insurance the hotel carries to cover the property lost in the fire. The Associated Press quoted Martin B. Smith, an insurance adjustor, as saying the hotel had sustained $4 million in damages from the fire.

393	GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO PLEDGES QUICK ACTION TO REQUIRE SPRINKLERS	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D61331F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon acknowledged today that the Dupont Plaza Hotel, scene of the fatal New Year's Eve fire, did not have a sprinkler system because one is not required by Puerto Rican law.\nGov. Rafael Hernandez Colon acknowledged today that the Dupont Plaza Hotel, scene of the fatal New Year's Eve fire, did not have a sprinkler system because one is not required by Puerto Rican law.\nThe Governor said the law would be amended as soon as possible to force all hotels to install them.\nIn a news conference on the grounds of the hotel, the Governor said a sprinkler system would not have been effective in this fire, where many guests and hotel workers were caught by surprise. Rule on Hotel Inspections\nAssistant Fire Chief Jose Carrasquillo said in an interview that the department was supposed to inspect all the hotels at least once a year, but that it was not always done because of shortages in personnel. He said he did not know the last time the Dupont Plaza had been inspected.\nHe said the inspections were held to make certain that fire exits were adequately marked, that hallways were kept clear, that hoses attached to standpipes were in working order and that there were fire extinguishers in the kitchens and other areas in which fire hazards might exist.\nMr. Carrasquillo said the regulations were based on Federal norms, but he could not say what Federal agency had drawn up the norms.\nHe said the regulations were adequate. ''We have had fires in many of the major hotels in the past and put them out uneventfully before any major damage was done,'' he said. ''This time there were circumstances that did not appear normal.''\nThe 420-room Dupont Plaza was built as the Sheraton Hotel in 1963, at the height of an island tourist boom. It opened the day before another major hotel, the Ponce de Leon, opened 10 blocks away in the Condado Beach area. Hilton a Pioneer in Industry\nIn between were the Condado Beach hotel and La Concha and such smaller hotels as Hotel LaRada.\nThe tourist industry in Puerto Rico began in 1949 with the opening of the Caribe Hilton on a rocky peninsula west of the Condado area. The 400-room Hilton was built by the commonwealth government in the hope it would start things in the tourist industry on the island. As a safeguard, the hotel was designed so it could easily be converted into a hospital.\nThe government invited several large hotel chains to operate its new hotel, but the only one that expessed interest was Conrad Hilton, who then owned a large number of hotels on the mainland.\nThe hotel was an instant success, giving birth to the island's hotel industry and to Hilton Hotels International.\nAnother hotel was opened by the InterContinental Hotel chain several miles to the east in Isla Verde, near the airport. Government Then Built Another\nThe government followed by building La Concha in the heart of the Condado area, then the site of stately homes and mansions by the sea, and invited another hotel chain to manage it.\nThe Condado Beach Hotel, which was built in 1919, was refurbished and expanded by its owners, contributing to establishing the area as the primary hotel district.\nWith so many hotel rooms on the market and so many islands building up their own tourism, Puerto Rican tourism developed into a spotty picture, particularly since the middle 70's.\nThe season now under way was considered the best in 10 years.

Pannunzio and 19 other guests in the burning Dupont Plaza Hotel lay sprawled on a 16th-story balcony, certain they were going to die.\nFor four and a half hours Wednesday, Dominick P. Pannunzio and 19 other guests in the burning Dupont Plaza Hotel lay sprawled on a 16th-story balcony, certain they were going to die.\n''Everybody was crying,'' the 50-year-old lawyer from Pennsylvania said. ''I was crying myself.''\nMr. Pannunzio, who had come out of the shower nude when he heard a commotion in the hall and grabbed a sheet to cover himself, said he and his group fruitlessly screamed and waved to attract the attention of rescue workers.\n''At the end, we were all just praying,'' said Betsy Sorber, 26, who had flown to Puerto Rico with Mr. Pannunzio and five others on a gambling junket several days ago.\nFinally, she said, firefighters broke down the door of the smoke-filled hotel room and led them to the roof. 'What Is the Best Way to Die?'\nAt that point, Mr. Pannunzio said, he had begun contemplating ''what was the best way to die, burning or jumping.''\nMr. Pannunzio, dressed today in a hospital worker's green surgical room pants and new running shoes, said he thought of jumping off the balcony with a mattress to cushion his fall. ''But that was too crazy,'' he said. One man in the group tried climbing up the side of the building toward the roof, but he kept slipping and seemed in danger of plunging to the ground. Finally, Mr. Pannunzio said, the others talked him into huddling with them on the balcony, wet towels and wash cloths pressed to their noses to help them breath in the dense black smoke.\nFifteen minutes before the fire broke out, Mr. Pannunzio said, he had been playing craps in the ground-floor casino, continuing a winning streak of more than $10,000. He had gone up to his room, 1508, to shower before going shopping with Miss Sorber. She was resting on the bed in slacks pulled over a one-piece bathing suit.\nMr. Pannunzio bounded out of the shower, threw open the room door and saw clouds of gray smoke and running guests.\nTogether, they plunged into a nightmarish fire exit stairwell, with people screaming, pushing, shoving, falling and being trampled.\n''We ran down to the eighth floor,'' he recalled, ''and we ran into a solid wall of people yelling, 'Go up! Go up! You can't get through here!' You couldn't see. Everyone was in a panic.'' 'People Were Gagging'\n''At the 17th or 18th floor,'' Mr. Pannunzio continued, ''a bunch of people were coming down yelling, 'Down! down! You can't go up!' We tried to get into one of the halls but all the doors were locked. People were gagging and falling down. I was getting woozy.''\nSuddenly, he said, a hysterical maid threw open a door on the 16th floor and Mr. Pannunzio and about 20 others surged behind him. The maid had keys and let them into a room. They soaked the towels and linen, pressed them to their faces and shuffled to the balcony.\n''People were crying and praying: 'Dear God, dear God, we're going to die,' '' he said.\nSeveral times a helicopter crew swung a seat on a rope toward them but no one could reach it, Mr. Pannunzio said.\nAt one point, Mr. Pannunzio said, he thought of the film, ''The Towering Inferno,'' and of the fire at the M-G-M Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., in 1980.\n''I thought, 'God, I'm on my couch watching television and I'm a part of this,' '' he said. ''I thought, 'Any minute I'm going to die.' ''\nWhen the rescue team broke through, Miss Sorber recalled, she could see only a tiny flicker of light from the usually bright helmet lights the men wore.\n''We all held hands,'' Miss Sorber said, ''and they led us out. We couldn't see where we were going.''\nOutside in fresh air, the group then had to scale a steel ladder that ran straight up the side of a wall leading to the roof, more than 20 stories above the street.\nOne of Mr. Pannunzio's friends from Pennsylvania broke a window in the casino with a chair and jumped two stories to the pavement. He broke a leg and severely cut one arm. Another member of the party, Mr. Pannunzio said, was still unaccounted for this afternoon.

James Cowan. He said Mr. Casse was attacked in front of 123 East 52d Street, while walking west between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, by a man in his late teens or early 20's. The assailant was described as a black man with close-cropped hair and wearing a beige or gray jacket and dark trousers. 'A Matter of Seconds'\n''The whole thing took a matter of seconds - a typical mugging,'' he said.\nAccording to the police, Mrs. Casse, 69, a retired doctor, tried to pull the mugger off her husband, but Mr. Casse fell to the ground as the mugger ripped through his pockets. Mr. Casse's head crashed into the sidewalk, and he fell into a coma shortly after his arrival at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital.\nHe died at about 10:30 A.M., of what a hospital spokesman said were ''massive intercranial injuries.''\nThe attacker made off with Mr. Casse's wallet, which the police said contained more than $500 in cash.\nThe police issued a statement saying they ''desperately need witnesses of the incident to come forward to identify the attacking youth.'' The Midtown North Precinct has established a 24-hour hotline - 477-7447 - for information about the attack.\nThe police said that the victim's wife was the only person to provide a description of the youth. Others Were Walking Behind\nThe couple was part of a group of nine tourists from Toulouse, in the south of France. But one of the group, Jacques Periole, said yesterday that only three of the other tourists were near the couple, and that they were too far behind them to help or to identify the suspect, who fled on foot.\nMr. Periole said the group had split up to hurry to Times Square in time for midnight because there was disagreement on the quickest route.\n''I can't believe there were no other witnesses, Lieutenant Cowan said. ''There were hundreds of people in the immediate area.''\nMr. and Mrs. Casse, who have three children, arrived in New York on Dec. 28, on what the police believed to be their first visit to this country, with the group. The couple spoke no English, and the police said they had been scheduled to return to Toulouse on Saturday.\nThe police asked Mrs. Casse to refrain from talking to the press until their investigation was completed, according to Lieutenant Cowan.\nIn all, 10 homicides were reported in the city overnight With an estimated 300,000 revelers gathered in the Times Square area, the nearly 2,000 police officers there made 34 arrests on charges ranging from robbery to criminal possession of weapons and assault, according to a police spokesman, Officer Louis Llanes.

The Associated Press reported that the Secretary of Justice, Hector Rivera Cruz, had put the death toll at 60.\nSurvivors of the fire said no alarms or public address or sprinkler systems went off and no organized evacuation was attempted by the hotel's employees. Seeking Signs of Arson\nThe flash fire broke out in a hotel ballroom minutes after union staff workers met there and rejected a contract settlement offered by management hours before a strike deadline.\nThe authorities said two minor fires of suspicious origin broke out in the hotel last weekend. They said investigators for the Federal Government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico were looking into reports that the fire Wednesday was set as part of individual or organized harassment of the hotel in the labor dispute.\nHowever, officials said they had not found any physical evidence to support such a theory as investigators began combing through the hotel looking for signs of arson. Governor Tells of Suspicions\nGov. Rafael Hernandez Colon said at a news conference that hotel guests interviewed by investigators had reported ''there was last-minute word going around the hotel that something was going to happen'' before the blaze broke out in a ground-floor ballroom shortly before 3:30 P.M.\n''On the basis of these suspicions, one tends to think this matter rises from the labor situation,'' the Governor said. If evidence points to sabotage, he continued, ''the magnitude of the criminal nature of this act goes beyond our imagination.''\nOfficials of Local 901 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents about 250 workers at the hotel, denied any knowledge of the cause of the fire and said their members were not involved.\nGovernor Hernandez Colon also said that the Puerto Rican fire code made no provision for fire sprinklers in hotels and none had been installed at the Dupont Plaza, the 23-year-old centerpiece of the Condado Beach resort section of San Juan.\nWitnesses said the fire Wednesday afternoon was followed by two or three explosions, sending a fireball rolling through the crowded casino, killing some gamblers and croupiers where they sat or stood at the gaming tables.\nMost of the 109 people hospitalized were treated for smoke inhalation and minor injuries and released, according to Dr. Carlos Gomez, chief of staff at the Central Medical Center. But 18 people remained hospitalized in critical condition, said a spokesman for the Governor.\nIn the charred hotel, the dead sat upright in chairs as if frozen by the fire's first flash, said Mayor Baltizar Corrado del Rio of San Juan.\nThere were also reports that the casino's main doors were closed after the first fire alarm as a precaution against smoke and as a security measure to guard the huge sums of cash on hand there. Most of the bodies on the destroyed ground-level floors of the hotel were clustered in the casino area. All but a few were burned beyond recognition. Identifying the Dead\nForensic investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation were flown into Puerto Rico today to help in the identification of the bodies, many of whom were believed to be those of tourists from the United States.\nIn addition, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms dispatched its national response team to Puerto Rico to help with the arson investigation. The 13-member team is made up of 10 special agents from the bureau, a forensic chemist, a specialist technician with expertise in explosives and a supervisor.\nA spokesman for the bureau, Jerry Rudden, said two additional specialists, a forensic chemist and an expert in fires and explosives, had also been sent. ''There will be additional people responding as needed,'' he said. He said that most of the team members had already arrived at Puerto Rico and that the Air Force was transporting the team's vehicle, a large, extensively equipped truck. Military Experts to Look In\nMr. Rudden would not say whether or not the bureau believed the fire to be arson, but noted that the investigation had only just begun. ''The team will remain there as long as needed to determine the cause of the fire, he said.''\nThe Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, which last spring helped identify the remains of the seven astronauts killed in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, has also dispatched three specialists to the scene, an institute spokesman said tonight in Washington. They included two pathologists and a forensic photographer.\nThe fire, which burned for nearly five hours, was contained on the lower floors of the 22-story building, but billowing smoke enveloped the entire hotel in a dark sheath, trapping guests in upper-floor rooms. Some Caught in Elevators\nSome victims died in elevators that jammed between floors. during the height of the blaze.\nMany guests made their way to a penthouse restaurant and roof and were rescued there by helicopters that carried them to the beach. There the injured were treated as waves pounded the sand a few feet away and sea gulls wheeled away from the commotion and smoky haze.\nSusano Gonzalez Perez was one of the casino employees who survived. Today, still shaken but unhurt, he stood on the grounds of the hotel in the bright sunshine and recounted how the first faint whiff of smoke Wednesday afternoon was quickly followed by chaos. He was working a roulette wheel at the time.\n''My supervisor shouted there was fire and for everyone to run,'' Mr. Gonzalez said, ''but there was no time. Fire coming like a ball shot across the ceiling. It hit my supervisor and killed him in his tracks.''\nThe croupier and others scrambled for safety as the fireball was followed by thick, choking smoke. Mr. Gonzalez and the others escaped after someone smashed open a part of the tinted floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the ocean. 'People Were Hysterical'\nThose escaping jumped several feet to the poolside patio below as sunbathers, some dazed and cut by the flying glass, stumbled and pushed their way toward safety on the beach.\n''People were hysterical,'' said Larry Roberts, a 34-year-old designer from Manhattan who, with a friend from Milwaukee, Jerry Kipnis, 30, had made a last-minute decision to spend the holiday week in San Juan. ''Once the explosion shattered the glass windows, everyone at the pool took off like crazy, jumping over barbed wire and knocking over older people who couldn't get over it.\n''Everyone was worried about a husband or kids who were upstairs and couldn't get out,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''It was like watching a movie, seeing people hanging from the balconies or tying bedsheets together to try to get down.''\nOn the level beneath the restaurant and the casino was the kitchen, and behind it, the ballroom, which about 100 members of the teamster union had just vacated before the fire was discovered. It was in the ballroom that the fire started, according to Rudy Torruella, the legal consultant for the hotel, which is owned by Hotel Systems International of Santa Monica, Calif. The hotel was originally operated by Sheraton when it opened in 1963 at a cost of $12 million. It was sold in 1979.\n''The only ones at the union meeting were union members and representatives,'' the lawyer said. ''When smoke was detected coming out of the ballroom, attempts were made to enter but a number of doors were barred from the inside. A few minutes later an explosion occurred in the area of the casino and the kitchen.'' Speculation on Spread\nLaw-enforcement officials speculated that a fire that started in the ballroom might have spread to gas lines and other fuels stored in the kitchen or boiler room, but no word from the staff was available on whether this, in fact, was the sequence.\nMayor Corrado said many Puerto Ricans frequented the casinos at beachfront hotels. Several local people who were described as inveterate gamblers were listed by their families as missing after the fire. Among others missing were two members of a Pennsylvania family visiting San Juan from a cruise ship, the Jubilee, which had sailed from Miami. They had gone to the Dupont Plaza to visit the casino and were there when the fire erupted.\nIn the confusion later 9 of the 11 members of the family were reunited, but an 83-year-old grandmother and her 20-year-old grandson never appeared. Later, after the New Year rolled in and dazed partygoers in gay party hats came from all over San Juan to view the floodlit, still-smoldering hotel, the Jubilee left port without the family. The nine survivors checked into a hotel to wait to be summoned to the morgue.\nMany people fled the burning hotel without money and only the clothes they wore. They spent a restless night at other hotels and private homes, which opened their doors to them.\nSome, like Christine Ryan and Robert Walker, New Yorkers, slept on mattresses on the floor of a big room at a hotel. As the New Year came, they numbly drank duty-free champagne they had bought on a shopping trip in the Virgin Islands: On their return, they found their hotel ablaze. Watching a Jets Game\nThey had experienced the two fires there last weekend and were familiar with the labor problems, Miss Ryan and Mr. Walker said. The manager told them that a fire on Saturday afternoon had been set in a ninth-floor storage room, the New Yorkers said.\n''I was watching the Jets' playoff game when all this smoke poured out of the floor below,'' Mr. Walker, a stockbroker, recalled. ''I was really angry. It made me miss the end of the game.'' Sidney Sheiman of Brooklyn, another guest, said that after the fire Saturday, the hotel posted security guards on every floor. ''They followed us around,'' he said.\n''It was the third fire for us,'' Priscilla Sprung of Manhattan said today as she picked through items of clothing and toiletries contributed to the survivors by the Salvation Army. ''We just thought it was part of the hotel routine by that time.''

398	OKLAHOMA BEATS ARKANSAS, 42-8; SIXTH IN ROW FOR PAC-10	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DE1031F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Well before Arizona State switched from the Western Athletic Conference to the more prestigious Pacific 10 in 1978, the Pac-10 had gained dominance over the Big Ten in their annual Rose Bowl match. In its first Rose Bowl appearance, Arizona State carried on the tradition of its league today.\nWell before Arizona State switched from the Western Athletic Conference to the more prestigious Pacific 10 in 1978, the Pac-10 had gained dominance over the Big Ten in their annual Rose Bowl match. In its first Rose Bowl appearance, Arizona State carried on the tradition of its league today.\nAfter trailing Michigan, 15-3, early in the second period, the Sun Devils scored a touchdown on their last drive of the first half and on the first drive of the second half to gain a 22-15 triumph over the Wolverines before 103,168 fans.\nJeff Van Raaphorst, the Arizona State quarterback who was voted the most valuable player of this 73d Rose Bowl, tossed short passes to his flanker, Bruce Hill, for both Sun Devil touchdowns. Ken Bostrom kicked three field goals to tie a Rose Bowl game record as the Pac-10 champion beat the Big Ten champion for the sixth straight year and for the 16th time in the last 18 years. The Big Ten trails in the series, 22-19. Strong Defense\nThe fast and swarming Arizona State defense shut down Michigan completely after the Wolverines got their second touchdown early in the second period. When Robby Boyd of Arizona State intercepted Jim Harbaugh's pass with just a minute left, the Sun Devils nailed down the biggest football victory in the history of the Tempe, Ariz., university.\nArizona State, ranked among the nation's top 10 teams, finished its year with a 10-1-1 record while Coach Bo Schembechler's Wolverines, ranked among the top five before today, ended at 11-2. This marked the seventh time in eight Rose Bowl tries a Schembechler Michigan team had lost. He has a 3-11 bowl record in his 18 seasons at Michigan.\n''We come out here every year and get beaten by 7 points,'' Schembechler said. ''We do it every year.''\nWhen Van Raaphorst accepted the m.v.p. award, he said, ''I'm glad I had the opportunity my Dad never had.''\nThe senior Arizona State quarterback, who completed 16 of 36 passes for 193 yards and two touchdowns without an interception, is the son of Dick Van Raaphorst, who was Ohio State's place-kicker in 1961 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten title. But the Ohio State faculty, citing ''overemphasis'' on football, voted against allowing the Buckeyes a trip to the 1962 Rose Bowl.\nArizona State, in only its second year under Coach John Cooper, settled down after being jarred by the two early Michigan scores and played so well for the last two and a half quarters that Michigan rarely had the ball long enough to make an impression. In the second half, Michigan had possession for less than 10 minutes.\n''You can't do much without the football,'' Schembechler said.\n''We coach to protect the football,'' Cooper said. No Turnovers Arizona State, which turned the ball over only 15 times during the regular season, didn't give it up once today. The Devils intercepted Harbaugh three times after his two touchdown aerials.\nThe Sun Devils seemed to be in trouble when Michigan had to punt from deep in its territory late in the second quarter. The Devils took a fair catch on their 40 with 3 minutes 59 seconds left in the half. This was five minutes after Bostrom had kicked his second field goal, cutting the Arizona State deficit to 15-6.\nOut of the shotgun formation, which he used well all game, Van Raaphorst flipped a short screen pass to his tailback, Darryl Harris, on the third play after the punt. With good escort blocking, Harris made a gain of 19 yards on the screen pass. He was the game's leading rusher with 109 yards and added 34 receiving.\nVan Raaphorst ran for another 10 on the next play. Then Van Raaphorst connected with Hill for 15 yards to get the ball to the Michigan 5. Two plays later it was at the 4.\nThat's when Van Raaphorst connected with Hill, who was deep in the end zone, for the first Arizona State touchdown, just 29 seconds before the half ended. Bostrom's extra point made the intermission score, 15-13, for Michigan.\nBut the momentum had swung Arizona State's way.\nThe Sun Devils took the second half kickoff and started a drive from their 20. In 15 time-consuming plays, they went the distance.\nVan Raaphorst, however, missed on a 2-point conversion pass, so the score remained 19-15 until Bostrom's final field goal, which came 44 seconds into the final quarter.\nHarbaugh directed a 66-yard touchdown drive in eight plays on the first series of the game. Jamie Morris, the tailback whose brother Joe runs for the Giants, ran the ball in for the score from the 18.\nIn a surprise play after the touchdown, Schembechler had his place-kicker, Mike Gillette, throw a pass to Gerald White for 2 points. The snap from center went directly to Gillette, a former high school quarterback.\nHarbaugh came back with another good drive of 58 yards in nine plays that ended when he went over from the 2, giving Michigan had a 15-3 lead.\nFrom then on Arizona State shut down Michigan and Morris, who gained 1,039 yards in the regular season. He rushed for only 47 yards today, only 4 in the second half.\nARIZONA ST. WINS

INTERCEPTS TEXAS A&M, 28-12	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DE1031F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Ohio State intercepted five passes by Kevin Murray today, returning two for touchdowns, to rout Texas A&M, 28-12, in the first Cotton Bowl appearance by a team from the Big Ten Conference.\nOhio State intercepted five passes by Kevin Murray today, returning two for touchdowns, to rout Texas A&M, 28-12, in the first Cotton Bowl appearance by a team from the Big Ten Conference.\nMurray, a redshirt junior who starred in last year's Cotton Bowl game, was off-target all afternoon. He threw only eight interceptions in 11 regular-season games.\nHe was the player of the year in the Southwest Conference this season, completing 61 percent of his passes and averaging more than 220 yards a game. Murray set a Cotton Bowl record with 292 passing yards in the Aggies' 36-16 victory over Auburn last New Year's Day. 49-Yard Interception Return But today, Michael Kee, an Ohio State linebacker, insured the victory by picking off a Murray pass with just under three minutes remaining in the game and racing 49 yards for the final score.\nIn the opening moments of the third quarter, Chris Spielman, the consensus all-America linebacker, stretched the Buckeyes' 7-6 halftime lead by intercepting a Murray pass and running it back 24 yards for a touchdown.\nOhio State stretched its lead to 21-6 on a 3-yard run by Vince Workman midway through the third period.\nKee and Spielman led the Ohio State defense with 18 unassisted tackles between them. Style Changes for Buckeyes\n''It was a great exhibition of defensive football,'' said Coach Earle Bruce, who had his Buckeyes in red shoes and himself in a dark suit and a black hat with a scarlet feather in it. Bruce normally dresses for games in a golf shirt, windbreaker and a baseball hat.\n''The thing I can't imagine is that we could return two of those interceptions for touchdowns,'' Bruce said.\nSpielman, a junior who was voted tha game's most valuable player, said Ohio State used three defensive formations in the game that it had not used during the regular season. He said the Buckeyes knew Murray ''would rather throw the ball than run.'' He added: ''I think he was a little frustrated.'' Murray took full blame. ''It wasn't anything they were doing,'' Murray said. ''It was misreading from my part. A couple of times I threw the ball down there and just didn't see the white jerseys.\n''Five interceptions is enough to kill any team. Spielman was used as a spy out there. They used the safety differently, and Spielman was everywhere.'' Ohio State Finishes 10-3\nThe victory gave Ohio State, co-champion of the Big Ten, a 10-3 record after it had opened the season with consecutive losses to Alabama and Washington. Texas A&M, which was aiming to become the only the second team to win two consecutive Cotton Bowls, finished at 9-3. Texas won in 1969 and 1970.\nOhio State's victory helped ease the pain of a disappointing 26-24 loss to Michigan that kept the Buckeyes from winning the Big Ten title outright and playing in the Rose Bowl.\nDespite amassing 150 yards in total offense in the first quarter, Ohio State held only a 7-6 halftime lead. Ohio State's first score came a few seconds into the second quarter, when Jim Karsatos capped an 80-yard drive with a smartly-executed, 3-yard touchdown run.\nKarsatos scored on an option play, knifing into the end zone ahead of several defenders. He had completed five consecutive passes that brought the Buckeyes within striking range. The touchdown wiped out the 3-0 lead the Aggies had taken on a 30-yard field goal by Scott Slater.\nOver all, the two defensive units intercepted eight passes on the day, tying a Cotton Bowl record set in 1962 by Mississippi and Texas. The five interceptions from Murray exceeded the previous record of four, yielded by Joe Montana of Notre Dame to Houston in 1979. Kee's 49-yard return broke by 2 yards a record set by Byron (Whizzer) White for Colorado in 1938, long before he became a Supreme Court Justice.\nThe defeat overshadowed an impressive game by Roger Vick, the fullback who scored the Aggies' only touchdown with just under 10 minutes to play. Vick, a 6-foot-3-inch, 221-pound senior who led the Southwest conference in rushing, shook off tacklers consistently, but the Buckeyes contained his longest run to 20 yards. He averaged nearly 5 yards on 24 carries for 113 yards. Ohio State's backs, George Cooper and Workman, combined for 100 yards between them.\nMurray, who said earlier this week that he would return for his fifth year of eligibility next season, finished with 12 completions in 31 passing attempts for 143 yards. Karsatos was 10 for 21, for 195 yards, with 2 interceptions.\nCOTTON BOWL

Tollner finished his four-year stint with a 26-20-1 record.\nFullwood, who gained 1,391 yards during the regular season, ran for 52 yards on 10 carries on Auburn's first scoring drive. Then he ran 4 yards for the go-ahead touchdown in the second quarter.\nAfter the game he said the effort ''was one of my most satisfying 'cause they were rude.''\n''They were one of the rudest teams we've ever played,'' Fullwood said. ''Instead of playing ball, they wanted to fight.'' A Most-Valuable Linebacker\nThe Auburn defense, led by the game's most valuable player - Aundray Bruce, a 6-foot-6-inch, 230-pound junior linebacker - forced a fumble to set up the go-ahead touchdown and pressured the Southern Cal quarterback, Rodney Peete, throughout the game.\nPeete's second-quarter fumble after a hit by Bruce led to Auburn's go-ahead touchdown, and Tracy Rocker caught Peete in the end zone to give Auburn the 9-point lead with 8 minutes 51 seconds to play.\nPeete, who became the first sophomore to pass for more than 2,000 yards in a season at Southern Cal, suffered four interceptions and was sacked five times, including four by Bruce, who was delighted that the Trojans did not make a special effort to stop him.\n''They were doubling up on our linemen, so that gave me the opportunity,'' he said. ''They were playing me one-on-one, and I don't feel that anyone can stop me that way.''\nAuburn, which finished in a four-way tie for second place in the Southeastern Conference, completed the season with a 10-2 record and the 500th victory in the school's history.\nPeete, who passed for 2,025 yards during the season, completed 12 of 30 for 113 yards.\nAuburn's Jeff Burger passed for 90 yards and had two passes intercepted in a defensive struggle marked by nine turnovers. #44 Yards Rushing for U.S.C.\nAuburn limited Southern Cal to 157 yards - 44 rushing on 30 carries -and 10 first downs. Auburn gained 200 of its 290 total yards on 62 rushing attempts, including 28 by Fullwood.\nSouthern Cal's lone touchdown came when a linebacker, Marcus Cotton, returned an inteception 24 yards in the first quarter.\nAuburn tied at 7-7 after Burger passed 3 yards to a tight end, Walter Reeves, for the touchdown.\nThe Trojans had a golden opportunity for a touchdown late in the game after a blocked punt gave them the ball at the Auburn 7-yard line.

Evans's lawsuit, for $1.3 million, was filed in United States District Court Wednesday.

Sugar Bowl.\nNebraska verbally attacked Louisiana State for more than a week and today backed it up with a 30-15 victory in the U.S.F.&G. Sugar Bowl.\nThe Cornhuskers (10-2) were led by Steve Taylor, the quarterback who was named most valuable player in the game, and a swarming defense that shut down L.S.U. after it had taken a 7-0 lead on the game's first offensive series.\nAfter arriving in New Orleans Dec. 23, the Nebraska players continually cast aspersions about the Tigers and their redshirt freshman quarterback, Tom Hodson.\n''Pressure on the passer was the difference in the game,'' said Coach Tom Osborne of Nebraska. ''The turning point came on those two big sacks.''\nThe key sacks came from Broderick Thomas, the end, and Danny Noonan, a consensus all-American middle guard, on the last two plays of the third quarter after L.S.U., trailing 17-7, had taken over on the Nebraska 17-yard line following a blocked field-goal attempt Motivation by Incident A defensive tackle, Neil Smith, a New Orleans native, said the motivation for Nebraska came on the first night in town, when nine players and two graduate assistants were arrested in the French Quarter for disturbing the peace, charges which were later dropped.\n''A lot of guys say they were mistreated and didn't want to come back,'' Smith said. ''I felt like we needed to give them a bonus to get them to want to come back.''\nNoonan, one of those arrested, said the incident was influential in the Huskers' performance. ''I think that only helped us,'' Noonan said. ''We got fired up. The people treated us like dirt.''\nNoonan said Nebraska's pregame remarks about L.S.U. was uncharacteristic for the Cornhuskers. ''I'm just glad we backed it up,'' Noonan said. Losing to a 'Sore Winner'\nToby Caston, a senior linebacker for L.S.U., felt the Nebraska players' comments before the game had fired up his team and made the loss especially hard to take.\n''We got killed today,'' Caston admitted. ''Whatever they said they were going to do, they backed it up. It's the most distasteful thing in my life to lose to a sore winner.''\nBill Arnsparger, coaching his final game at L.S.U., said: ''They whipped us.''\nThe Cornhuskers (10-2) apparently did not win the respect of some of the players they beat.\n''I can't stand Nebraska,'' said Harvey Williams, a freshman running back for L.S.U. (9-3). ''I thought they were a good, clean team. They're not. They were scratching, trying to claw my eyes. . .''\nWilliams, who rushed for 56 yards and one touchdown on 12 carries, said he'd like to play Nebraska again. But he said next time they should have ''police on the field instead of officials.''\nL.S.U. set a Sugar Bowl record for penalties in the game with 12 for 130 yards.\n''It was from the talk all week,'' Hodson said. ''Our offensive line was offended by what Nebraska said. Everyone was intense. We just kept going after the whistle blew.''\nTaylor capped a 9-play, 72-yard drive that required only 63 seconds by scoring on a 2-yard keeper to give the Cornhuskers the lead for good at 10-7 with only 39 seconds left in the first half.\nSUGAR BOWL
403	OKLAHOMA BEATS ARKANSAS, 42-8; TWO SCORES FOR TILLMAN	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DC1031F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Oklahoma, sparked to life by Spencer Tillman's two breakaway touchdown runs in the second quarter after a dull first quarter, defeated Arkansas, 42-8, tonight in the most lopsided Orange Bowl game since 1973.\nOklahoma, sparked to life by Spencer Tillman's two breakaway touchdown runs in the second quarter after a dull first quarter, defeated Arkansas, 42-8, tonight in the most lopsided Orange Bowl game since 1973.\nTillman scored on runs of 77 and 21 yards, and the quarterback, Jamelle Holieway, ran for two short third-quarter touchdowns as the Sooners grew stronger throughout the game. The Razorbacks, who dominated the first quarter and appeared to play evenly with Oklahoma in the second, were completely ineffective in the second half and were intercepted five times on the night before scoring in the game's closing seconds.\nThe victory, Oklahoma's second straight and record 11th over all in the Orange Bowl, provided some measure of revenge for the Razorbacks' 31-6 upset victory over the Sooners in the 1978 game. Oklahoma's 34-point margin tonight was the largest in an Orange Bowl since Nebraska clobbered Notre Dame, 40-6, in 1973.\nThe game was played on a soggy field that was left uncovered when torrential rains soaked the Miami area New Year's Eve. Gray splotches of mud at midfield surrounded the smiling King Orange symbol that had to be repainted this afternoon.\nThe Sooners were returning to the site of their lone defeat this season, a 28-16 loss to Miami Sept. 27 that toppled them from the top of the nation's rankings. Had Oklahoma won that game, it would have been playing Penn State here tonight for the top national ranking in a rematch of last year's Orange Bowl, which Oklahoma won, 25-10.\nInstead, top-ranked Miami will play second-ranked Penn State Friday night in the Fiesta Bowl at Tempe, Ariz.\nBrian Bosworth, Oklahoma's all-America linebacker, was one of four Orange Bowl team members - three from Oklahoma, one from Arkansas - who were barred from playing tonight after testing positive for steroids last month. Bosworth, however, was one of four Oklahoma co-captains representing the Sooners at the opening coin toss tonight, wearing his jersey over a pair of blue jeans.\nThe Razorbacks controlled the ball for most of the first half as they ran 41 plays to the Sooners' 21, and held Oklahoma to just 14 yards in the first quarter. But the Sooners, who were favored by two and a half touchdowns, built a 14-0 halftime lead on two nearly identical second-quarter pitchout plays that led to touchdown scores by Spencer Tillman.\nArkansas had the first scoring opportunity, 10 minutes into the game, but Kendall Trainor fell about an end zone short on a 52-yard field-goal attempt and the first quarter ended scoreless. On the third play of the second quarter, Holieway pitched right to Tillman on second down, and the senior halfback streaked 77 yards down the right sideline for a touchdown.\nTwo subsequent second-quarter Arkansas drives into Oklahoma territory ended when Greg Thomas passes were intercepted, first by Sonny Brown and then by Dante Jones. The second interception set up a nine-play, 54-yard drive by the Sooners, which ended when Holieway again pitched right to Tillman, who ran it in from the 21-yard line.\nTillman set an Oklahoma freshman record when he rushed for 1,047 yards in 1983, but missed much of his sophomore and junior seasons recovering from several hamstring injuries. As a senior this season, he was only the fourth-leading rusher for the Sooners, and the most yardage he gained in a game was 80 against Kansas State.\nHe accounted for 107 yards on six carries in the first half tonight.\nThe Sooners doubled their margin in the first seven minutes of the second half. After shutting down the Razorbacks deep in their own territory, the Sooners took over at the Arkansas 44 on their first possession. On the second play, Holieway connected on a 36-yard pass to Derrick Shepard. Two plays later, Holieway ran the ball in from the 2-yard line for Oklahoma's third touchdown.\nOn the second play of the Sooners' next possession, Holieway handed off to Lydell Carr, who ran 60 yards before being brought down. Holieway kept the ball on the next play and scored from the 4-yard line.\nArkansas was forced to punt from its end zone near the end of the third quarter, but regained posession when Bubba Barrow recovered Eric Mitchell's fumbled punt return attempt. Thomas passed the Razorbacks to the Oklahoma 33, but his next pass landed in the hands of Oklahoma's Derrick White. BOSWORTH'S ARRAY OF APPAREL\nEven though he was ineligible to play in the game, Bosworth attracted attention. He wore a blue headband as well as his Oklahoma jersey when he went to midfield for the coin toss. While standing on the sidelines before the game, Bosworth wore the orange No. 14 jersey of the University of Miami's Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, Vinny Testaverde. Later in the game, Bosworth donned a shirt with ''N.C.A.A.'' in big letters. Under each letter, the shirt read: ''National Communists Against Athletes. Welcome to Russia.''\nThe reference was to the drug tests conducted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.\n''These tests are like going into a dark room with a shotgun,'' Bosworth said. ''I got picked off early.'' ARIZONA ST. WINS
404	LAWYERS ASSERT QUEENS VICTIMS WOULD AID U.S.	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D91031F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Lawyers for the two surviving victims of the Howard Beach attack said yesterday that their clients would cooperate with Federal authorities if they take over the case. But the lawyers said they would not be satisfied unless Governor Cuomo appointed a special state prosecutor to handle the case.\nLawyers for the two surviving victims of the Howard Beach attack said yesterday that their clients would cooperate with Federal authorities if they take over the case. But the lawyers said they would not be satisfied unless Governor Cuomo appointed a special state prosecutor to handle the case.\nThe lawyers, Alton H. Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason, made their comments in separate telephone interviews. It was their first response to a report by law-enforcement officials on Wednesday that District Attorney John J. Santucci of Queens may turn the case over to Federal authorities. 'Bad Faith' Is Charged\nMr. Maddox represents Cedric Sandiford, described by the authorities as the state's key witness. Mr. Mason represents another victim, Timothy Grimes. After initially cooperating, Mr. Sandiford has declined since retaining Mr. Maddox to cooperate in the investigation of the death of the third victim, Michael Griffith. Mr. Grimes has also declined to cooperate.\nThe lawyers have accused Mr. Santucci's office and the police of ''bad faith'' and a cover-up in their inquiry -a charge Mr. Santucci and other officials have strenuously denied.\nMr. Maddox has offered a different account from the police of officers' treatment of Mr. Sandiford after the attack. Mr. Maddox has also criticized how the police dealt with the driver of the car that killed Mr. Griffith, and Mr. Maddox has differed with the police on Mr. Sandiford's account of the death. The lawyers have not offered details to support their charge.\nThe police did not charge the driver, Dominick Blum, a 24-year-old court officer, with any crime, although he acknowledged leaving the scene; he returned an hour later. Mr. Maddox has said Mr. Blum should be arrested for murder. The police say a grand jury may yet indict Mr. Blum for leaving the scene, but they say he had no connection to the attackers.\nYesterday, Governor Cuomo's press secretary, Martin Steadman, said of Mr. Maddox: ''I think this man has no credibility, zero credibility. And I answer his reckless charges only with sorrow because they don't deserve to be answered. But because of the dimension of the tragedy in Howard Beach, I'm answering them.'' Mayor Koch said yesterday that he still thought Mr. Sandiford should testify before a grand jury, and Mr. Steadman said the Governor also urged such a step.\nThe Mayor and the Governor's spokesman also repeated the suggestion that the lawyers should take any allegation of police or prosecutorial misconduct to the special prosecutor for the New York City criminal justice system, Charles J. Hynes.\nMr. Griffith, a 23-year-old Brooklyn man, was struck and killed by Mr. Blum's car after he and the other two black men fled a gang of white youths who had chased and beaten them on the night of Dec. 19-20. Except for the attackers, Mr. Sandiford is believed to be the only witness to the end of the chase.\nThree youths have been charged with reckless endangerment in the case, but a Queens judge dismissed murder, manslaughter and assault charges against them on Monday, after Mr. Sandiford would not testify.\n''We would urge Sandiford and Grimes to cooperate with a Federal investigation,'' Mr. Mason said. But he added, ''Turning the case over to the Federal authorities is an admission that the State of New York is not prepared to confront one of the most serious racial incidents in the history of this country.''\nMr. Maddox said that giving the investigation to the Federal Government ''would send a dangerous signal to the black community and would only aggravate the current situation.'' 'The Same Precarious Position'\n''It would tell us that we are in the same precarious position as our brothers in the South were in in the 1950's and 60's: that is, that the only government that would be willing to protect our civil rights was the Federal Government,'' Mr. Maddox added.\nLocal law-enforcement officials have said Mr. Santucci might turn the case over to the Federal authorities because it would be easier to gather evidence and convict the defendants under Federal law than under state law, even without Mr. Sandiford's testimony.\nThey said this was so because Federal immunity and conspiracy laws make it easier to obtain and use testimony from accomplices to a crime. Penalties for a Federal civil-rights conviction in which the violation caused a death could be up to life in prison, the same maximum as for a murder conviction in New York State.\nA spokesman for Mr. Santucci, Thomas McCarthy, declined yesterday to confirm whether the District Attorney was considering calling in the Federal authorities, saying only that he was ''exploring a variety of options.'' Lawyers Are Disputed\nBut Mr. McCarthy sharply disputed the lawyers' contention that giving the case to the Federal Government would be an admission of failure by the state.\n''It is the failure of Mr. Sandiford to come forward that puts Mr. Santucci in the position of having to consider the various alternatives,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''That is not a failure of the system, but a failure of cooperation that has created this situation. Remove the block and the system can work. Don't put the block in front and say, 'See, the system doesn't work.' ''\nAndrew J. Maloney, the United States Attorney in Brooklyn, said his office had not received ''any direct or official request'' from Mr. Santucci to join the case. But he said ''they have been consulting and conferring with us on it'' for several days.\nMr. Maloney confirmed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had begun a preliminary investigation of the Howard Beach case at the request of the Justice Department in Washington. But he said that by law, his office would need the approval of the United States Attorney General to intercede. Decision Expected Soon\nMr. Maloney said the normal procedure would be for Mr. Santucci to request intercession and for the United States Attorney's office to make a recommendation to the Attorney General on whether to accept it. He would not comment on whether he would recommend joining the case, but said he hoped ''some decision would be made by sometime next week, just because of the nature of the case and the sensitivity of it.''\nMr. Koch said, ''The best way to serve justice and to do it expeditiously is for the witness to come in and tell his story before the grand jury, and why he doesn't is a great mystery to most New Yorkers.''\nAt the same time, the Mayor said, ''Mr. Maddox should go to Joe Hynes and make his case, if he has one, of a cover-up. They apparently decline to do that, and why they decline is a mystery.''\nMr. Steadman said the Governor also believed the lawyers should take their case to Mr. Hynes, who is responsible for investigating allegations of police, judicial and prosecutorial misconduct in New York City, if they were dissatisifed with the investigation.\nMr. Steadman said the Governor's Director of Criminal Justice, Lawrence T. Kurlander, had reviewed the case and told Mr. Cuomo he could find no evidence of a cover-up or improper actions by law-enforcement authorities.\nMr. Steadman said, ''There is a first-class special prosecutor in place,'' speaking of Mr. Hynes. ''They should go to him if a special prosecutor is what they truly believe they need.''\nMr. Maddox, responding to the Mayor and Mr. Steadman, said he had not gone to Mr. Hynes and did not intend to because ''he does not have the mandate to cover all aspects of what is involved in this case.''\n''When Mr. Hynes was appointed, the scope of his jurisdiction did not envision racially biased cases, and he does not have the resources or the equipment to deal with those kinds of cases.''

406	AFTER INFERNO, CONFUSION AND ANGER	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD81031F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: For Lorraine Sherman of Brooklyn, the disaster was far from over today.\nFor Lorraine Sherman of Brooklyn, the disaster was far from over today.\nShe was in her room on the ninth floor of the Dupont Plaza Hotel when a fire broke out Wednesday afternoon on the hotel's lower floors. She recalled spending ''a couple of hours, an eternity,'' on the terrace until firefighters using ropes were able to lower her to safety.\nToday, Mrs. Sherman spent another eternity waiting in the tropical sun across the street from the charred 22-story hotel. ''My husband was in the casino,'' she said in a trembling voice, her cheeks wet with tears. ''And as of now, he's still missing.'' Difficulty Identifying Bodies\nPolice and government officials said it could be days or even weeks before those who perished in the fire were definitively identified. ''Most of the bodies are totally burned,'' said Danny Velez, press secretary to Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon. For those who survived, New Year's Day was filled with confusion, anger and questions.\nMany survivors lingered near the 420-room hotel. Most were barefoot or wearing only bathing suits, bathrobes, T-shirts or whatever clothes they had on when the fire broke out.\nA number of survivors complained that no alarms or sprinkler systems went off after the fire broke out and there was no organized attempt to evacuate hotel guests. Others complained about conditions after the fire.\n''It's outrageous,'' said Barbara Zellman, a teacher from Manhattan. ''I have no money. My passport, my tickets, all my things are in my room. They haven't even given us any information.''\nLate this afternoon Dupont Plaza's director, Bruce Shulman, said that all guests would be reimbursed for lodging and meals through Saturday and provided travel expenses. Personal possessions still in the hotel, he said, would be bagged and shipped later.\nFor many survivors, however, lost property seemed the least important concern. Thomas Cadden, a 35-year-old lawyer from Meriden, Conn., said he was glad just to be alive. When the blaze erupted he was in the casino, the area where the largest number of deaths appear to have occurred.\n''I was sitting at the blackjack table,'' he said, speaking from his bed at the Pavia hospital where he underwent four hours of surgery Wednesday night. ''I was looking at the ocean through the window and I saw smoke. I said to the dealer, 'Where is that coming from?' '' 'There Was Total Chaos'\nTo Mr. Cadden's surprise, the dealer did not look up from the table. Instead, he continued to deal the cards.\n''Then I heard this explosion and thick black smoke started pouring in,'' he said.\nIn the rapidly darkening room, ''there was total chaos, panic, people screaming and running,'' he said.\nSomehow, he made his way to the window. ''I thought either I go through this window or I die here,'' he said. He grabbed a chair and smashed the glass, crawled out onto the ledge, cutting his hands on sharp glass, then lowered himself to a second ledge, which collapsed beneath him.\n''I fell roughly 25 feet, a long way, and I fractured my ankle,'' he said. ''A friend of mine and two college kids saw me and they came over and helped.''\nCharles J. Collins of Paxton, Mass., who was in a restaurant by the pool, told how he, his wife and daughter scaled a three-foot wall topped by barbed wire and dropped 12 feet to the beach.\n''We could look up and see people banging on the glass trying to get out of the casino,'' he said. ''Everybody was screaming. People were hung up in barbed wire. People were hanging off the balconies. The smoke was so bad you couldn't see the people on the upper floors.''\nNancy Brensson, a 12-year-old from Cresskill, N.J., said she was with her parents in their 12th-floor room when she noticed white smoke outside.\n''My dad opened the terrace door and the smoke came rushing in and it started to get dark,'' she said.\nThey left the room and tried going down the staircase but ''it was filled with black smoke and we could see flames below,'' she said. They headed for the roof, where they waited for about an hour, as more and more people joined them.\n''I was prepared to die,'' said Nancy's mother, Baiba, 39. ''I just didn't know whether it would be from fire or from smoke.''\nEventually, ''a helicopter came,'' Nancy said. ''We had to jump to get into it. My father almost missed: He was hanging out of it for a while.''\nLike many survivors, the Brenssons had strong words of praise for ordinary citizens of San Juan and for other tourists who came to their aid. ''There was this one guy named Nick and his wife and they were on the roof calming everyone and kind of taking charge,'' Nancy said. Mr. Cadden, as well as others at the hospital, emphasized that they had been well cared for by medical personnel. But there was also sharp criticism of some aspects of the rescue effort and outright anger toward the hotel staff and management. Concern Over Earlier Fires\n''There have been at least two other fires here recently,'' said Murray Fink, an engineering designer from Brooklyn. ''I had asked security about it and they said, 'Don't worry.' I asked about smoke alarms and the concierge told me, 'Oh, we don't need those, the building is concrete.' ''\nRobert Howard, an accountant from Livingston, N.J., said one fire broke out about 12:30 A.M. Sunday in a storage room on the ninth floor. He said that he had heard no fire alarms but that the teen-age children of another guest had alerted everyone by pounding on doors.\nOne man pulled a fire alarm, Mr. Howard said, ''but it didn't work.''\nThe Howard family moved to another hotel the next day. ''I said to my wife,'' he said, ''either we find a room elsewhere or we're off this island.''\nAlthough government officials today would say only that arson could not be ruled out, many guests felt certain that was the cause, adding that they thought it was related to a union's dispute with the hotel. The union denies any role in the fire.\n''It was going on all week, they were burning mattresses and there were rumors that it had to do with the union,'' said Michael McGahan, a stockbroker from Mineola, L.I. ''But it was being treated more or less like a joke, not like it was something serious.''\nMr. Shulman, the hotel director, said this afternoon that there had been three small fires at the hotel within the past 10 days and that 30 extra security guards had been put on duty. He said the hotel conformed with all safety regulations.\nSome guests discussed what they thought could have been indications that day of troubles to come. ''We noticed that the maids made the rooms up earlier and then were gone and that the kitchen staff left early,'' said Linda Wolf of Bloomfield, Conn. ''There were arguments, verbal fights among the staff in the dining room. We had lunch at one o'clock and the waiters left before my husband could pay the check.''\nWhile some employees may have just wanted to be home early New Year's Eve, ''I was here at Christmas and they didn't behave that way,'' she said.\nWitnesses and survivors put the start of the fire at no later than 3:30, and some expressed dismay that fire engines did not arrive until nearly 4 o'clock.\nAlexander Leighton, who owns a guest house, Casa Blanca, half a block from from the smelled smoke as he was walking his dog on the beach. ''I checked my watch - I'm a real nut for time,'' he said. It was 3:26, he noted. A View From the Beach\nThen a curl of black smoke caught his eye. It was coming from the lip of the roof over a hotel restaurant adjacent to the casino on the lobby level.\nFrom the beach Mr. Leighton looked into the casino through its large tinted windows. He could make out figures inside. Slot machines glowed in chrome-lined rows. Shadows moved near the craps tables. Silhouettes were hunched over the blackjack tables. Then, he said, an explosion sent a fireball flaring inside the tinted windows and the composition he had observed moments before broke apart.\nToni Goldberg flew from Philadelphia late Wednesday night in hope of finding her 70-year-old mother but had had no success. ''I've checked all the hospitals, and she's not there,'' she said this afternoon.\nA lucky few did find their loved ones. ''Until 10:30 at night I thought for sure my daughter was dead,'' said Cecile Leprohon of Montreal, who escaped from her 16th-floor room into the basket of a hovering helicopter. ''I prayed and I promised a thousand dollars to the Church if she was alive. Now,'' she said, touching the sleeve of the bathrobe worn by her daughter, Judith, ''I'll be happy to pay.''
407	UNION IN HOTEL DISPUTE INSISTS IT HAD NO ROLE	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D71031F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Leaders of the labor union engaged in a bitter dispute with the management of the luxury hotel that was gutted by fire here Wednesday insisted today that they had nothing to do with the fire, which some officials suggest may have been arson.\nLeaders of the labor union engaged in a bitter dispute with the management of the luxury hotel that was gutted by fire here Wednesday insisted today that they had nothing to do with the fire, which some officials suggest may have been arson.\nThe fatal fire broke out in an empty hotel ballroom minutes after the union, Local 901 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, ended a meeting there about 3:30 P.M.\nOne survivor, a 35-year-old Mexican woman, said a hotel cook told her the day before the fire that he was afraid of violence in the labor dispute and was not planning to work on New Year's Eve.\nAnother survivor, Alfredo Vertz, a 38-year-old accountant from Elmhurst, Queens, said he had received an anonymous phone call in his room at 9:34 A.M., about six hours before the fire. Mr. Vertz, who grew up in Peru, said the caller, a woman speaking Spanish with what he thought sounded like a Puerto Rican accent, had said, ''I'm going to burn you and everyone else in the hotel.'' Optimism on Dispute Cited\nMr. Vertz said he had reported the call to a clerk at the front desk and was told that several other guests had reported similar threatening calls but that there was nothing to worry about. Mr. Vertz was at a restaurant outside the hotel with his family when the fire started.\nBruce Shulman, the hotel director, said threats had been made against the hotel, but he declined to say whether any had been made on Wednesday.\nThe union leaders and perhaps a dozen rank-and-file members said that although they had unanimously rejected a new management offer, they had left the Wednesday meeting optimistic that a solution would be reached before a midnight strike deadline.\n''The Secretary of Labor's office had offered to help us mediate, and the Tourist Office, too,'' Jose E. Cadiz, the secretary-treasurer and chief negotiator for the union, said at a news conference in his office this afternoon.\nThe president of the local, Rene Rodriguez, said of the fire, ''We have no idea how this happened.''\nThe fire occurred as tourism in Puerto Rico is vigorously rebounding from nearly a decade in the doldrums, and many hotels, including the Dupont Plaza, have been running at near capacity. 'A Blow' to Tourism\nHector Luis Acevedo, who as the Puerto Rico Secretary of State is the commonwealth's second-highest official, said in an interview that the fire ''obviously is a blow'' to the resurgence in tourism.\nMiguel A. Domenech, executive director of the commonwealth's Tourist Company, the government agency responsible for tourism, said that if investigators determined that the fire had been the work of arsonists the effect on tourism ''would be even worse'' than if it proved to be an accident.\nMr. Cadiz of the teamsters said that over the last two weeks he concluded negotiations with two other hotels and the island's convention center and that he was so confident he would find a way out of the Dupont Plaza impasse that he had booked a seat on a flight to Philadelphia this afternoon for a vacation. He said he canceled the reservation this morning.\n''I didn't think there was going to be a strike,'' said Victor Fernandez, a 38-year-old desk clerk and union delegate who attended the teamsters' meeting Wednesday. 'A Good Season'\n''We got a hell of a good season and neither management nor we in the union were going to lose this season,'' he said.\nThe union had voted on Dec. 22 to strike. Mr. Domenech of the Tourist Company said that he had offered several times to mediate the dispute, as recently as two days ago, but that both sides had told him they were too far apart.\nThe union had been seeking a pay raise of $1.50 an hour over three years, and the hotel had been offering 90 cents, those familiar with the negotiations said.\nIn addition, union officials said, the hotel was also proposing contract changes that would have permitted the replacement of about 60 union members with short-term, nonunion workers.\nThe union leaders said that in the Wednesday meeting they had read aloud the latest proposal, in which the hotel increased its pay offer to $1 over three years. The leaders said several points members had previously objected to were accepted by the members and that the only remaining barrier to a solution was the section calling for the elimination of the union members' jobs. Hoping for Resolution\n''We were really hoping we could resolve the conflict,'' Mr. Rodriguez said.\nBoth Mr. Cadiz and Mr. Rodriguez repeatedly denied any involvement by themselves or any union member in the start of the fire.\n''We trust in God it was an accident,'' Mr. Rodriguez said, ''for the sake of the tourist industry and for Puerto Rico.''\nIn a brief interview, Bruce Shulman, the hotel's vice president for sales and marketing, said he would not comment on whether he suspected the union. But he called attention to the afternoon meeting in the ballroom and said: ''The fire broke out in the ballroom.''\nMr. Cadiz of the teamsters said he had first learned of the fire in a telephone call at 3:50 P.M.\n''A member said on the phone that there was a big fire at the Dupont Plaza and that people were jumping out the windows,'' he recalled. ''I couldn't believe it. I went right to the hotel. I had to see it to believe it.''\nMr. Domenech said that while there had been some strikes at hotels here in recent years, he could not recall any that had broken into violence.\nThe teamster official said the unit at the Dupont Plaza was organized 22 years ago when the hotel was a member of the Sheraton chain.\nAccording to hotel officials, the Dupont Plaza had spent $700,000 on renovations and expansions that were to be completed in February.
408	STORM AND TIDES BATTER THE SOUTH AS SNOW HITS THE NEW YORK AREA	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D71031F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A winter storm, combined with unusually high tides and gale-force winds, caused extensive damage along the Southern coast yesterday before sweeping northward into the New York metropolitan area.\nA winter storm, combined with unusually high tides and gale-force winds, caused extensive damage along the Southern coast yesterday before sweeping northward into the New York metropolitan area.\nThe New York area prepared for coastal flooding, icy roads and slow going in the rush hour this morning, as many commuters end their New Year's holiday.\n''Stay at home, if at all possible,'' was the advice of Clifford Crowley, the meteorologist in charge of National Weather Service's New York City forecast office.\nThe storm washed away decks and sidewalks yesterday at resort hotels on the South Carolina coast and flooded North Carolina beaches, damaging waterfront homes.\nThe same tidal forces created the highest tides in nearly 20 years on the West Coast, forcing the closing of some coastal roads for the fourth day in a row. The Cause: Syzygy\nTides worldwide, Mr. Crowley said, have been unusually high this week because of syzygy, a rare alignment of the Sun, Moon and Earth that increases gravitational pull. Furthermore, the Moon is at the point in its orbit nearest to the Earth.\nThe Weather Service and Coast Guard officials last night issued coastal flood warniings from Virginia through New England.\nIn addition, the Weather Service warned that the storm of heavy rain and snow would reach its peak in the New York area between 8 and 10 A.M. this morning, when tides will be at their highest in area waters.\nCasinos in Atlantic City were warned to get their employees to work before 7 A.M., ahead of the high tide. As a precaution, flat-bottom punts were flown in from St. Louis for possible evacuations, and the Coast Guard put extra crews on duty.\n''We're now playing it up as a worst-case situation,'' said Jay Krieger, chief meterologist for the National Weather Service in Atlantic City. ''We will get some flooding. The question is how much.''\nAs much as four inches of snow had fallen in parts of northern Jersey and Rockland and Westchester Counties by 10 P.M. last night, with two inches reported on Long Island, according to the Westher Service.\nMr. Crowley, who was watching the slow northward movement of the storm, said the accumulation of snow to the north and west of New York City and in Connecticut could reach 10 inches in inland areas. In the city, he said, two inches of snow were expected.\nShortly before 11 P.M. last night, as roads filled with wet snow, the New York City Police Department issued a warning to motorists of ''hazardous driving conditions.'' Winds at 40 Miles an Hour\nShould the storm stall just to the east of the coast, ''it could snow all Friday and into Saturday,'' Mr. Crowley said. ''But if it comes straight at us up the coast, the snow should turn to rain.''.''\nHe said winds at the peak of the storm this morning should be 40 to 50 miles an hour, pushing the unusually high tides - already two to three feet above normal - still higher.\nIn California, yesterday marked the fourth day that officials were forced to close a lane of the Pacific Coast Highway at Sunset Beach. No damage was reported.\nOn the Washington State coast, a 50-year-old barn at a spot called Washaway Beach, near Grayland, slipped into the ocean Wednesday after high tides erorded its foundation. Power Out in North Carolina\nSouth Carolina beaches were littered with planks from boardwalks and with trees, but damage to buildings appeared to be less than that caused by a storm last month that left $3 million in damages, according to Patrick Dowling, public information officer for the city of Myrtle Beach, S.C. ''There has been substantial flooding, but no damage to condominiums or motels or hotels,'' Mr. Dowling said.\nCivil defense workers in South Carolina's coastal counties said it could take days to compile damage estimates.\nNorth Carolina officials reported extensive damage to waterfront homes at Long Beach, an island community near the state's southernmost tip. Earl Gilbert, a dispatcher for the Long Beach Police Department, said the situation was ''considerably worse than the December storm because of the exceptionally high tide and winds gusting to 50 miles an hour and heavy rain.''\nIn western North Carolina, the storm dropped as much as 10 inches of snow and left more than 18,000 people without electricity, the authorities said. Evacuation in Florida\nIn Belle Glade, Fla., on the south shore of Lake Okeechobee, 40 people were evacuated when their mobile homes were damaged by high winds and a tornado. Eight people were treated for cuts and bruises at a local hospital, according to Russ Kocher, a nursing supervisor at the hospital.\nEighteen trailer homes were overturned or destroyed, with damage estimated at $130,000, said Mark Phillips, a spokesman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department.\nBecause of the New Year's holiday, traffic on the major roads and highways throughout the New York metropolitan area was light when the wet snow began falling last night, officials said.\n''Luckily we haven't had any serious problems,'' said Sgt. Charles Cossentino of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's Police Department. He said air traffic at the city's three major aiports was also light because of the holiday. ''Most people seem to stay at home on New Year's Day,'' he said. Salt on the Roads\nMore than 100 trucks operated by the New York City Department of Sanitation began spreading salt on the city's major arterial highways around 6 P.M. yesterday, according to Vito A. Turso, a spokesman for the department.\n''We've also put an additional 300 workers on the midnight to 8 A.M. shift,'' he said. ''They'll either be removing snow, or collecting the backlog of New Year's Eve leftovers.''\nHe warned that if the snow did turn to rain overnight, there would probably be street flooding this morning. ''But we'll worry about that later,'' he said.\nHigh winds whipped rain mixed with snow across most of Long Island.\nEdgar Hultman, a meteorologist at the Weather Service in Manhattan, said, ''It's going to be a lousy day Friday morning.''

We are also likely to see a continuation of last year's debate over the proper role of the judiciary in interpreting the Constitution.\nIn the year ahead, we will be celebrating the 200th anniversary of our Constitution. We are also likely to see a continuation of last year's debate over the proper role of the judiciary in interpreting the Constitution.\nSince it appears that judicial review is here to stay, some who remain troubled by it urge that at the very least the enterprise of judges deciding constitutional questions should be limited to discovering the intent of the Framers. This approach is advanced to reduce judicial discretion, to increase certainty and to assure that the dispute at hand will be resolved by reference to the document rather than the judges' personal predilections.\nI regard reliance on original intent to be a largely specious mode of interpretation. I often find it instructive to consult the Framers when I am called upon to interpret the Constitution, but it is the beginning of my inquiry, not the end. For not only is the quest for ''intent'' fraught with obstacles of a practical nature - notably that the Framers plainly never foresaw most of the problems that bedevil the courts today - it may also be more undemocratic than competing methods of construing the Constitution.\nIf the search for ''intent'' sums up the constitutional enterprise, then current generations are bound not merely by general language but by specific conceptions frozen in time by men long dead. This problem did not escape the notice of the Founding Fathers. Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison ''that the earth belongs . . . to the living; that the dead have neither powers nor rights over it.'' He suggested that the Constitution expire naturally every 19 years, but the idea was rejected as unworkable. Noah Webster remarked that ''the very attempt to make perpetual constitutions, is the assumption of a right to control the opinions of future generations; and to legislate for those over whom we have as little authority as we have over a nation in Asia.''\nThe open-textured nature of most of the vital clauses of the Constitution signifies that the drafters expected future generations to adapt the language to modern circumstances, not to conduct judicial autopsies into the minds of the Framers. When the Founding Fathers talked about due process, equal protection and freedom of speech and religion, they were embracing general principles, not specific solutions.\nAnother problem of the ''original intent'' approach is that it fails to deliver on its promise to constrain judicial discretion. In imagining that there is a discrete, discoverable intent behind even the most general constitutional phrases, courts are more apt to be led astray than when they employ less backward-looking approaches. Remember, it was Chief Justice Roger B. Taney who invoked the Framers' intent in Dred Scott, not Chief Justice Earl Warren in Brown v. Board of Education.\nEven if we could agree that original intent is the true source of constitutional meaning, we would be no better off. No complete and accurate record exists today to tell us what the founders thought. Even Madison's notes, the best record we have of the convention, were far from complete and never intended to serve as an authoritative record. He had other tasks that interfered with his secretarial responsibilities - not the least of which was to play a leading role in the debates. Some of the notes were written in the evening, still others after the convention adjourned. Years later, Madison revised the notes in places where they conflicted with the written recollections of other participants, but points of disagreement still exist.\nYet even if we had a complete transcript of the proceedings, are there any so naive to think that we could harvest definitive answers? As with contemporary Congressional debates, we would encounter unresolved conflict, unexpected omissions and abundant ambiguity, both the deliberate variety designed to encourage compromise and the inevitable inadvertent kind.\nAnother question to which I have never found a satisfactory answer is: Whose ''intent'' should we be trying to discover? The Constitution and amendments were ratified by state legislatures or conventions, and the ratifiers were more than 1,600 in number. Should we not consult the historian - or more accurately, the oracle - to see what they thought?\nMore to the point, if the Constitution is truly a document of the people, why not attempt to find out what the electorate thought? Certainly, if ''original intent'' is a mechanism designed to reconcile judicial review with democratic theory, as its proponents maintain, it makes little sense to preoccupy ourselves with the ideas of the privileged few who had a hand in drafting the Constitution. Searching for the intent of the ratifiers or the people, however, is even more of a wild goose chase - particularly since the Constitution has since been thoroughly transformed as a result of the amendments made after the Civil War.\nIn short, while judges should make every effort to learn what the Framers thought, such a quest cannot be expected to produce definitive answers. The Framers' legacy to modern times is the language and spirit of the Constitution, not the conflicting and dated conceptions that may lay beneath that language. It is always a terrifying realization to learn that our fathers are no longer walking beside us. But we must be content that they provided us with general guidance. Even if they cannot point the way with precision, their legacy can still guide us.

The dawn of 1987 marks a welcome change in this dubious tradition.\nNew York City's courthouse jobs have long been dispensed by local political party machines, which still exert an unhealthy influence over the election of judges throughout the state. The dawn of 1987 marks a welcome change in this dubious tradition.\nBeginning yesterday, court workers are barred from moonlighting in key party positions, like district leader or club officer. The prohibition, announced last July by the state's Office of Court Administration, broadens the rule that has been in force over a decade for the law clerks and secretaries hired directly by elected judges.\nNeed for the new rule became clear last January when Mildred Snyder, a Surrogate Court adoption examiner who was also the first deputy of the Queens Democratic Party, became next in line to succeed Donald Manes as county leader. Rightly wary of the appearance created by Ms. Snyder's dual role, the state's chief administrative judge, Joseph Bellacosa, ordered her to choose between her job and politics. She chose her job. Mr. Bellacosa then sought the general rule.\nIt's unknown how many court workers are affected by the new rule, but the principle at stake is clear. New Yorkers have a right to courts that are halls of justice, not bastions of clubhouse patronage.

In this era when women are accomplished engineers, lawyers, heads of investment firms, contractors, firefighters, police officers and garbage collectors, it has been proved that childhood dolls and mud pies are unreliable indicators of future sexual or professional orientation.\nParticularly offensive to the wife of a composer is Dr. Green's implication that musical gifts are not associated with traditional masculinity. What about the 80-year-old conductor Pierre Monteux, arriving late for a Boston Symphony benefit concert with a loving arm around his ebullient wife: ''Sorry, we were being naughty!'' Or Ralph Vaughan Williams? Or Arthur Rubinstein? Or Richard Wagner? Or the rest of the conventionally passionate tribe? Composing was so often considered an exclusively masculine province that gifted women were published under their husbands' names or with masculine pseudonyms.\nDr. Green's use of ''sissy boy'' is insulting to the youngster who sees nothing desirable in bloody noses and black eyes, but who has a matchless gift for musical expression. At Interlochen, the national music camp, we have often broken up a baseball game to extricate a soloist for a piano or harp concerto, and I know at least one teen-age composer who's a soccer and tennis champion. If they loathe gang combat, professional football or prizefighting, they are more likely to come later to oppose spending billions for international warfare. That's heroic, not ''sissy.''

413	Let's Scrap That Indefensible Board of Estimate	1987-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DF1E31F931A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: To the Editor:\nTo the Editor:\nEdward N. Costikyan's defense of the New York City Board of Estimate is striking not only because of the short shrift he gives to the first principle of constitutional democracy -''one man, one vote'' - but also for the political self-interest that accounts for it (Op-Ed, Dec. 17).\nEssentially, he argues for protecting the political interests of boroughs, actually of Manhattan, rather than the rights of citizens. In other words, ''one borough, one vote,'' even if the one borough has one-third as many people as another borough, or less than one-tenth. Two Federal courts have found this proposition indefensible.\nMr. Costikyan would stand the Constitution on its head to keep the board's ''citywide perspective,'' while acknowledging the board practice of ''deferring to the views of the borough president most affected by the issue under consideration.'' This, with the board's archaic structure, guarantees ''that the interests of the smaller boroughs will not be overridden.''\nMr. Costikyan, a Manhattan lawyer long active in the borough's politics, seems concerned to protect the interests of Manhattan, which he concedes is now one of the smaller boroughs. He fears that a more democratic arrangement than the present board would give Brooklyn or Queens three times as much power as Manhattan. And these two boroughs combined would have three times the clout of Mr. Costikyan's Manhattan and its traditional ally, the Bronx.\nThus, Mr. Costikyan worries that ''a reconstituted board would be tempted to increase commercial real estate taxes in Manhattan.'' This question, which goes to the heart of New York politics, is the kind of issue that is now decided by the Board of Estimate, but without giving all New Yorkers an equal voice. The Board of Estimate is, as most informed observers know, the centerpiece of municipal corruption because its power to decide such questions is unprincipled and unchecked.\nPower does indeed corrupt, and first of all it corrupts the logic of those it benefits.

On the other, we are told that if we look too hard and push too far we will cripple the Presidency, paralyze our Government, dismay our allies, embolden our adversaries and engage in pointless self-immolation before a bewildered world.\nOn the one hand, Americans want to find out what really happened. On the other, we are told that if we look too hard and push too far we will cripple the Presidency, paralyze our Government, dismay our allies, embolden our adversaries and engage in pointless self-immolation before a bewildered world.\nThis is understandably the self-serving view of the Administration, which has its own reasons for wanting to put the Iran scandal behind it and move on to other things. It is also, rather predictably, a view that is gathering a measure of pundit support. It would be no surprise one of these days to read about a revival of the old Committee to Defend the Presidency formed in the Watergate era by agitated lawyers claiming that their interest lay in the preservation not of Richard M. Nixon but of the Presidential office itself.\nThe America-can't-afford-a-crippled-Presidency view finds additional support abroad. Sophisticated foreigners tend to regard American zeal in ferreting out executive wrongdoing as one more proof of the incorrigible immaturity of the United States in a grown-up world. The French in particular cannot understand today, any more than they could in Watergate time, why the world's most powerful democracy commits so spectacular an art of self-destruction over so venial a transgression. When France sank the blameless Rainbow Warrior, the Greenpeace anti-nuclear protest ship, in New Zealand, killing one crew member, no Frenchman seemed to care whether the President or Prime Minister had authorized the crime.\nPerhaps they order such matters better in France. But let us first define the issue and assess the consequences. There are many differences between Watergate and whatever it is we finally choose to call the Iran-Nicaragua flimflam (Iragua? Irangate?). Watergate was domestic politics; this is foreign policy. The Watergate mob was out to destroy political opposition; the current crowd is out to save the world. But whatever the differences in motives, the two scandals raise the same fundamental question. That question is whether the President is above the Constitution and the laws.\nAmericans may be forgiven for taking this question seriously. I remember the brilliant English historian Hugh Trevor-Roper explaining Watergate to a British audience by comparing it with the revolt against royal prerogative in 17th century England. When Hampden refused to pay ship money in 1636, the real issue was not ship money but the crown's claim to absolute power. Foreigners wondered then why the English made such a fuss about ship money when an unhampered English Government might have exerted much influence in Europe. ''But the English,'' Mr. Trevor-Roper wrote, ''thought first of their own liberties; and who shall say that they were wrong?''\nThe issue is only secondarily Iran and the contras. The underlying issue is whether Presidential prerogative should supersede the Constitution and the law. The next question is whether Americans, in thinking first of their own liberties, are really doing such serious damage to their own institutions and to the Republic's position in a dangerous world.\nThe Presidency is plainly in trouble. But it is not in trouble because of what Congress and the press have done to the executive. It is in trouble because of what the President and his men have done to themselves. Even so, some pundits say, it will be hard to conduct foreign policy in the months ahead if Congress and the press persist in challenging the Administration's version of things; and, since this is the only Government we have, its incapacity will harm us all.\nBut the international doubts about the Reagan Administration's credibility are not the result of Congressional and newspaper exposes. They are the consequence of the Administration's bad habit of solemnly declaring one line toward Iran, Libya and terrorism and pursuing the opposite line under the table. It is this wretched fact, not Congress or the press, that makes every foreign chancellery skeptical of the Administration's word. Nor will the Administration's incapacity in foreign affairs be remedied if Congress and the press should relapse tomorrow into statesmanlike and respectful silence.\nWhen an Administration's foreign policy is incoherent, duplicitous and dedicated to rash and mindless policies, what indeed is so awful about a crippled Presidency? Surely a crippled Presidency is far better for the nation and for the world than an unchastened and unrepentant one. Would even the French be happy to see Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North back in harness, his Presidential carte blanche restored?\nNo Presidency deserves any more trust than it has earned. This Presidency, with its record of international recklessness, deserves to be kept strictly on the leash for the rest of its time in office. Let us hear no more about the horrors of a crippled Presidency.\nStill, some insist that crippling will do permanent damage to the office. That was the pious line of the Committee to Defend the Presidency a dozen years ago. I remember Prof. Charles L. Black Jr. of the Yale Law School arguing in Watergate days that if Mr. Nixon turned White House tapes over to the Congress it would mean a betrayal of his ''successors for all time to come.'' The tapes were turned over, and the Presidency survived. Mr. Nixon was driven from office, and the Presidency survived. The Presidency even flourished for a season under Mr. Reagan, until he, like Mr. Nixon, overreached - and provoked the appropriate constitutional retribution.\nLet's not worry about the Presidency. The office is indestructible if for no other reason than that our system cannot work without Presidential initiative. Presidents need protection less than the rest of us need protection from Presidents. The electorate's obligation is to demand executive accountability. The Constitution has never pretended to guarantee against Presidential incompetence, folly, stupidity or criminality. As the Supreme Court put it in a celebrated decision, the Republic has ''no right to expect that it will always have wise and humane rulers, sincerely attached to the principles of the Constitution. Wicked men, ambitious of power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of law, may fill the place once occupied by Washington and Lincoln.''\nThe Constitution cannot guarantee against that. But it can guarantee accountability. Through the separation of powers, it can guarantee that when a President abuses power, corrective forces exist to redress the constitutional balance. As Senator Sam Ervin put it in Watergate days, ''One of the great advantages of the three separate branches of Government is that it's difficult to corrupt all three at the same time.''\nAmerica should feel proud, not apologetic, about the present reaction against Reagan excess. That reaction is not a failure but a stirring vindication of American democracy. It is evidence of the determination of the admonition to future Presidents to respect their inaugural oath to execute the office faithfully and to preserve and protect the Constitution.\nOnce a President permits reckless policies in defiance of the Constitution and the laws, he can expect precisely what is happening to President Reagan today. Americans think first of their own liberties - and who shall say that they are wrong? No one at home or abroad should be upset for a moment at the national determination to redress the balance of the Constitution. Quite the contrary: everyone should rejoice at this latest proof of the health and vitality of American democracy. The world will be far better off for it.\nCorrection: January 5, 1987, Monday, Late City Final Edition

And while there is seldom anything resembling a consensus in the investment community, many market experts are convinced that stock prices can continue to rise as long as interest rates go no higher than current levels.\n''I'm reminded of that quote by Mae West, who said, 'Too much of a good thing is wonderful,' '' said John Hotchkis, whose firm, Hotchkis & Wiley in Los Angeles, is keeping the $2.5 billion it manages for 25 institutional investors almost entirely in the stock market. Dow Up 22.6% for Year\nEven though corporate earnings did not live up to expectations this past year, Wall Street triumphed, thanks in large part to some heady first-half gains, spurred by lower interest rates on competing bond investments. The Dow Jones industrial average, which tracks the action of 30 of the nation's biggest stocks, rose 22.6 percent in 1986, far outpacing the broader indexes of the New York, American and over-the-counter stock markets.\nThe blue-chip Dow index even threatened to catapult through the vaunted 2,000 level during December, before pulling back. On Wednesday it closed at 1,895.95, not far off its record of 1,955.57 set Dec. 2.\nTo put those numbers in perspective, the Dow closed at just 788.05 on that Friday in August 1982 when the Federal Reserve cut the discount rate, which is the all-important rate it charges its member banks for loans. In the 52 months since then, in what has become by some measures the second-best bull market in history both in terms of percentage gains and duration, investors have made an estimated $500 billion in paper profits from equities. That vast sum far surpasses any gains scored in such a span.\nA. C. Moore, head of research at Argus Research, for instance, is predicting that the stock market will climb 15 percent in 1987, which will correspond closely to the amount he thinks corporate earnings will rise.\nBut Mr. Moore believes most of the gain will come in the latter part of the year. In early 1987, he fears, stock prices will come under pressure because of poor economic conditions. 'It Won't Last Forever'\nYet even the most ardent supporters of the market realize stock prices go in both directions. As Mr. Hotchkis put it: ''It won't last forever. We still live in a cyclical world, and no one has yet found the whereabouts of the tooth fairy.''\nThe cycle that people are most worried about these days is an economic one. Even with the Federal Reserve combating softness in the nation's economy through a friendly monetary policy, corporations for the most part are still reporting mediocre profits.\nThe Standard & Poor's Corporation predicts that moderate to good earnings growth will be experienced by the retailing industry, banking, drugs, insurance and microcomputer software companies. A turnaround will take place, it predicts, for computer makers and the closely related semiconductor industry.\nStaying in the dumps, it believes, will be the auto and oil industries, while profits for the military industry will remain at about this year's levels. Brokerage Recommendations\nBrokerage firms, as always, differ on where to invest in 1987. Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., for instance, is recommending the home-building industry, as well as paper and forest products stocks.\nIn those groups, it likes Georgia-Pacific, Great Northern Nekoosa, Hovnanian Enterprises, Kaufman & Broad, Lennar Corporation and Ryland Group. Among other stocks it finds attractive are Anheuser-Busch, the beer maker; Arkansas Best, a trucking company, and Gannett, a newspaper publisher.\nBut Wall Street is also keeping a wary eye on other things. Insider trading scandals and tax reform, although monumental news events in 1986, may not yet have had a full-blown impact on the stock market. And new trading techniques - notably the split-second programs used by professionals to participate simultaneously in futures, options and stocks - could have an even more profound effect on who is willing to play the market in the years to come.\n''We are in a bull market, but we have not had the traditional third leg of the bull market,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist with Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment firm, who predicts the next upturn will still occur. ''The reason has been disappointing economic growth and disappointing profits.'' Growth Estimates Lower\nMore than 50 economists recently surveyed by Eggert Economic Enterprises Inc. of Sedona, Ariz., estimate, furthermore, that the nation's real gross national product will rise a modest 2.5 percent in 1987. In the middle of 1986, those same economists were predicting more energetic G.N.P. growth of 3.5 percent.\nStandard & Poor's, whose stock indexes are some of the most carefully watched on Wall Street, said corporate profits improved just 11.2 percent during 1986. That was far below the 20-percent-or-so rise the 500 companies that make up S.&P.'s biggest index had been expected to enjoy. The early prediction for 1987: a 20 percent profit jump.\nProfits in the stock market, meanwhile, have been so enormous that some experts fear they cannot continue to grow - especially without getting a forceful assist from a better economy. 'More Than People Expected'\nSaid Leonard Heine Jr., who manages $1 billion worth of other people's money through the Management Asset Corporation, based in Westport, Conn.: ''1986 was so much more than people expected, and it was due primarily to the destruction of interest rates. People were looking for places to put money. And I don't think any of us, in our wildest dreams, anticipated a market reaching 2,000 by the end of 1986.''\nLower interest rates help the stock market to divert money from competing investments.\nIndeed, money has come out of low-paying certificates of deposit and money market funds, for instance, and gone into stocks. But there is little evidence that corporate profits are picking up a windfall from lower credit costs. 'A Very Sluggish Economy'\n''Nowhere do we see any fundamentals that support a market staying at this level,'' said Mr. Heine. ''You have, to say the least, a very sluggish economy.''\nTaking a slightly broader historical view, however, might justify the gains. ''If you look at it in the longer-term context, by taking into account the fact that the market was so weak during the late 1960's and all during the 70's, I think you would draw a slightly different conclusion,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist of Chase Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ''To some extent, I think we are just catching up to a weak and undervalued stock market in those prior years.''\nThe biggest mystery of 1987, market experts agree, will be the insider-trading scandals that have rocked Wall Street. Nearly everyone expects the Securities and Exchange Commission's lasso to catch others who might have helped Ivan F. Boesky, the now deposed king of Wall Street arbitragers, illegally reap enormous profits on corporate takeovers. Effect on Corporate Takeovers\nBut the Boesky situation could end up having its biggest effect on corporate takeovers, which have proved very profitable these last few years not only for Wall Street professionals but also for the average investor who happens to find himself holding stock in a company that gets bought out.\nThe takeover binge - which caused such well-known concerns as RCA, Celanese, Chesebrough-Ponds and Richardson-Vicks to be betrothed to other companies - has been propelled, in large part, by the easy availability of takeover financing. And one reason money has been so available is the growth of the high-yield junk bond market, which has been pioneered by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.\nNow Drexel and some of its executives find themselves under investigation in the Boesky case. If anything comes of that investigation, despite Drexel's insistence that it knows of no wrongdoing, the firm's ability to sell junk bonds could be impaired, and the takeover explosion could be muffled in the years ahead. A Slower Pace Expected\nBut even without such an impact, the trend of corporate takeovers will probably continue at a somewhat slower pace.\n''I think you are going to see them,'' said Robert Pirie, head of Rothschild Inc., an investment firm that has been an adviser on corporate takeovers. ''You are going to see big ones, but nothing like the volume you've seen in the last three or four months.''\nTakeovers were particularly heavy late in 1986 as companies raced to expand, contract or restructure before the new tax laws took effect on Jan. 1.\nBut the tax laws may also have an impact on the kinds of stocks that investors are willing to buy. Market experts say the new laws, which eventually will treat the gains won when a stock goes up in price the same way as a paycheck, will probably cause investors to take fewer risks.\nThat might mean a rebirth for good, safe stocks that pay predictable dividends.\n''I think that in general, with the change in the tax structure, many people will change their philosophy in investing,'' said Barry Salzberg, a partner in charge of executive financial counseling at the accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells. Investors will have to be pretty certain, he said, that the gains that will be achieved on a particular stock will offset the extra tax.

Increased stability in Afghanistan and enhanced credibility for its Government could smooth the way for a reduction of Soviet troops, according to the Western diplomats.\nMr. Gorbachev has said a Soviet withdrawal would be contingent on the reduction of outside aid to the guerrillas.\nSoviet officials and Western diplomats said last month that the presence of more than 100,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan, while not a serious drain on Soviet resources, was damaging to Moscow's international image and an impediment to Mr. Gorbachev's effort to give Soviet foreign policy a new look.\nMr. Gorbachev, who visited India in November, has tried to increase Soviet influence in Asia and the Middle East but has been thwarted to some extent by Moslem anger over the Soviet role against the Moslem guerrillas in Afghanistan.\nThe problem for Moscow, according to the diplomats, is that it cannot accept a pro-Western Government in Kabul, but that such a government would probably take power if Soviet troops were not present.\nAlthough there have been reports of progress in the United Nations-sponsored negotiations on Afghanistan, a political settlement appears unlikely in the near future, the diplomats said.\nAFGHANISTAN TO OBSERVE A CEASE-FIRE

The culprit is WNVC, Channel 56, in Falls Church, Va., a commercial-free outlet that covers Capitol Hill and affairs of state by day, then bombards its viewers with college play once the sun goes down.\nWashington-area basketball fans are in imminent danger of a television overdose, and the blame can't be laid to CBS, NBC or even ESPN. The culprit is WNVC, Channel 56, in Falls Church, Va., a commercial-free outlet that covers Capitol Hill and affairs of state by day, then bombards its viewers with college play once the sun goes down.\n''We're sort of a cross between C-SPAN and ESPN,'' says Matt Miller, production manager for WNVC and its sister station, WNVT (Channel 53), which, between them, will carry more than 200 games this season.\nViewer demand for the games springs partly from the fact that most of the capital still hasn't been wired for cable, leaving a nighttime sports vacuum that the two stations are happy to exploit. Though both are publicly owned, neither is a member of the Public Broadcasting Service, and their lack of such PBS mainstays as ''Masterpiece Theater'' is fine with hoop fanatics, who could barely be better served by satellite dishes in their own backyard. The twin stations have six dishes - three with ''splitter'' capabilities to take in more than one game simultaneously - and can thus blanket the Washington area with live and taped coverage of all the major conferences and such popular independents as Louisville, Marquette and Notre Dame.\nThe stations spend between $2,000 and $3,000 a game on rights fees, which are paid for by the viewers. Since there are no commercials, a timeout on the court allows a return to the studios for that sine qua non of public TV, the pledge break. Surplus from the pledges winds up in general operating funds, in effect subsidizing such non-sport activity as the telecast of the State Department's daily press briefing. The system has proved so successful that in the year just ended, WNVC added some 70 college football games to its schedule, as well as college hockey and a weekly two-hour sports call-in show.\nThough Channels 53 and 56 are now well into the season's coverage, the best - or at least the most - is yet to come. Commercial-free basketball ends this year just before the start of the national tournament with the second annual WNVC college basketball marathon - 35 consecutive hours of play from Friday afternoon to Saturday midnight. Tipoff is at 1 P.M., March 6.\nSCOUTING

Rock Album of the Week: ''Pusherman EP,'' Live Skull (Homestead). With each new record, New York's Live Skull delivers a more concentrated brand of emotional intensity, a more ferociously disciplined sonic assault. Live Skull's instrumentation -two guitars, bass and drums - is the only thing generic about the band. The guitarists, Mark C. and Tom Paine, play parts so tightly meshed and intricately lapidary, their two instruments sound as one. Marnie Greenholz's bass and James Lo's drums draw on the evolving urban rhythms of rap and funk, but their beats are artfully scrambled, and stripped down for maximum power-drive. Playing as a unit, Live Skull builds up layered patterns of deliberate harmonic distortion, sawtooth-wave interference patterns, and other electro-acoustical phenomena with painterly attention to shape and color. And they deliver all of this within the context of tightly structured songs. For this listener, Live Skull's music - a high-wire act played for keeps, without a net - is as challenging, as spiritually corrosive, and ultimately as transcendent as Albert Ayler's mid-60's free-jazz or the implacable drone-dance of the early Velvet Underground. It's one of the essential sounds of our time.

Markets were closed Thursday for the holiday and ended early yesterday.\nJames Vick, vice president and senior corporate trader at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said most of the dollar's movement was caused by traders adjusting their positions rather than any economic news.\nCommerce Department reports that construction spending fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in November and factory orders rose 4.1 percent the same month had little effect, Mr. Vick said.\nTrading continued thin, meaning the few transactions that took place had an exaggerated impact on the market, he said.\nIn Europe, dealers said that Wednesday's announcement of a record $19.2 billion monthly trade deficit continued to pull the dollar downward yesterday, but little else affected the extremely quiet trading there. Most traders were expected to be back in the market on Monday.\nThe West German central bank did not actively intervene to support the dollar, dealers said. A stronger dollar makes West Germany's United States exports more expensive. In Europe, the dollar closed at 1.9165 West German marks, down from 1.9250 late Wednesday. In New York later, the dollar closed at 1.9240 marks, up from 1.91975 Wednesday.\nThe pound rose again on the strength of optimistic forecasts for the British economy and higher British oil prices. Britain is the world's fifth-largest oil producer. In London, it cost $1.4925 to buy one pound, more than $1.4820 late Wednesday, and in New York, sterling rose to $1.4890 from $1.4845.\nTokyo foreign exchange markets were closed yesterday. The dollar fell against the Japanese yen in London, to 158.15 yen, from 160.10 on Wednesday. In later New York trading, the dollar closed at 158.475 yen, up from 158.05 on Wednesday.\nOther late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Wednesday, were: 1.6070 Swiss francs, down from 1.6110; 6.3550 French francs, down from 6.3825; 2.1670 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1720; 1,337.25 Italian lire, down from 1,343.00, and 1.3787 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3805.\nOther late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 6.3575 French francs, down from 6.3620; 1.61525 Swiss francs, up from 1.6090; 1,338.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.3782 Canadian dollars, down from 1.38045.\nGold climbed overseas on the basis of stronger oil prices and the weaker dollar, traders said.\nGold rose in London to a late bid price of $403.50 a troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $390.75.\nEarlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $11.90 to close at a bid $402.99 an ounce.\nLater, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold cost $401.90, down from Wednesday's close of $404.90 The gold market in Zurich was closed again yesterday.

The franc was fixed officially at 3.3120 marks, down from 3.3093 before the New Year's holiday.\nThe European Monetary System links the currencies of eight West European countries.

Shipley's ''The Origins of English Words.'' He describes it as ''an old term for a boor.'' That's the ''boor'' who is synonymous with ''churl, lout, clown, bumpkin, clodhopper, hick, yokel and rube,'' and not the ''bore'' who makes your eyes glaze over.\nI have been looking for an occasion to write the word ''clinchpoop'' ever since stumbling over it in Joseph T. Shipley's ''The Origins of English Words.'' He describes it as ''an old term for a boor.'' That's the ''boor'' who is synonymous with ''churl, lout, clown, bumpkin, clodhopper, hick, yokel and rube,'' and not the ''bore'' who makes your eyes glaze over.\nI don't like ''boor.'' It's an irrational prejudice. Writers have them, and antipathy to ''boor'' is one of mine. ''Lout'' is my favorite among the synonyms above, which are lifted from Webster's Third. ''Churl'' is pretty good, but too cute if what you have in mind is a prime ''lout.''\nI dislike ''bumpkin,'' ''clodhopper,'' ''hick,'' ''yokel'' and ''rube'' and rarely use them, probably because they all come close to some truth about myself that I'd rather not confront.\n''Clinchpoop'' is a word that challenges writers to find the perfect setting for it. Henry Adams found a splendid setting for ''boors'' when he wrote ''Love makes gentlemen even of boors.'' If, however, he had written ''Love makes gentlemen even of clinchpoops,'' we would fault him for writing too clangorously.\n''Clang,'' incidentally, descends from the same Indo-European root (''kleg'') that sired ''clinchpoop,'' according to Dr. Shipley.\nThe difficulty of finding a setting for ''clinchpoop'' may explain why the Oxford English Dictionary lists it as obsolete. The last instance the O.E.D. finds of anyone writing ''clinchpoop'' was in 1589. Imagine: not even Shakespeare could find a way to use it artfully. Nor Donne, Dryden, Pope, Dr. Johnson, Burke nor any other top-drawer writer right up to George Bernard Shaw and Red Smith.\nAbout five paragraphs back, I called something ''pretty good,'' and felt guilty about it. Someone authoritative has written that good writers don't use ''pretty'' in this way. I do it often, even though I know better.\nThis is another prejudice at work. I am partial to the indefinite modifier, which I studied at the knee of my Uncle Bruce, who measured all distances in terms of right goodness. A stranger asking him ''How far is it to the schoolhouse?'' was told ''It's a right good piece.'' Asked ''How far is it to California?'' Uncle Bruce, who lived in Virginia, might have been a bit more precise, saying ''Oh, well now, that's a right good piece, a right smart distance out there.''\nNotice that the second sentence of the previous paragraph runs on into two relative clauses: ''which I studied'' and ''who measured all distances.'' I normally avoid sentences like that because they feel like they're running out of breath. The trick is to chop them into short, snappy sentences, but doing so in this case would create a hopelessly wrong sense of Uncle Bruce, whose manner was leisured rather than short and choppy, probably because he lived and died without ever seeing a television commercial.\nWhile revealing these writers' secrets, I may as well explain that, yes, it's courting trouble with your English teacher to write, as in the above paragraph, that long sentences ''feel like they're running out of breath.'' Rule makers prefer ''feel as if,'' and I usually write by the rules.\nSuppose, though, that you were a long sentence, running maybe a page or two in Gibbon's ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.'' Imagine somebody calling to you right after you had hurdled the third semicolon: ''How do you feel, pal?'' I submit that if you're a sentence with any blood at all in your veins you gasp ''Like I'm running out of breath,'' and not ''as if I'm etcetera.''\nSomebody who wrote magically -possibly H.L. Mencken - dealt with the problem of when and when not to be grammatically correct by hypothesizing that he heard a knock at his door and asked, ''Who's there?'' Should the knocker reply, ''It's me'' or ''It is I''? ''Anybody who replies, 'It is I,' '' said this magical writer (possibly Mencken), ''doesn't get into my house.''\nIn short, to write well you ought to know when it's wrong to be right.\nMore personal prejudices: I refuse to find out what ''hermeneutics'' and ''semiotic'' mean, and I never write words whose meanings I know if I can't pronounce them (''paradigm'' and ''eschatological,'' for instance), yet I often use words whose pronunciations please me, even though I don't know their meanings (''ineffable'' and ''egregious,'' for example).\nFinally, I never start writing until I know what I want to do. In this column, for example, I wanted to do something Shakespeare couldn't: use the word ''clinchpoop'' gracefully.\nOBSERVER

''The market continues to rally based on the OPEC agreement,'' said Andrew Lebow, an analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\nThe agreement reached last month calls for a 7.6 percent cut in production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries during the first half of 1987.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents lower to 19 cents higher with the February contract at $18.13 a barrel.\nHeating oil was 0.10 cent lower to 0.76 cent higher with February at 50.71 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.39 cent to 0.53 cent higher, with February at 49.73 cents a gallon. 'A Rally in a Bear Market'\nThe rise in livestock prices was essentially ''a rally in a bear market'' at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said Charlie Richardson, an analyst in Denver with Lind-Waldock.\n''The beef market had been sharply lower early this week, and traders figured that after they had taken $4 to $5 off, the odds would be that they would put $2 back on before taking any more off,'' he said.\nAs a result, he said, some traders on the futures market who had sold borrowed contracts in anticipation of a price decline turned into buyers.\nDespite yesterday's advances, Mr. Richardson said, ''it's difficult for anybody to be bullish'' because of the increased numbers of animals expected to be marketed during the first quarter.\nGrain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.\nAnalysts said larger deliveries of beans against the January contract put pressure on soybean prices.\nWeighing on the market in general was the expectation of large increases in the amounts of corn and soybeans that farmers will be selling in the coming weeks.\nThe belief is that farmers have been holding back selling beans and corn until they could take advantage of the lower tax rates of 1987.\nFUTURES/OPTIONS

It is, they say, technically superior to most European fiddling and musically more imaginative. . And second, New York is the Irish fiddling capital of the Western Hemisphere.

Paddy Reynolds left Garvary, Ballinamuck, in County Longford some 40 years ago. He came to the Bronx and in the 1950's built a reputation by performing at weddings and dances. His playing represents the New York style of fiddling. His partner this evening will be Brian Conway.

By Sharon Sheehe Stark. 359 pages. William Morrow & Company. $17.95. To the local Pennsylvania Dutch farmers, the Kleeves are an odd, heretical band of outsiders obsessed with possessions and things. They stood, thinks their handyman, as ''a single slipshod strangeness, united against him and his, indifferent to the plight of their surroundings, undeserving, finally, of a single nugget of Bauscher County mud.''\nThough Sharon Sheehe Stark is interested in examining their ''corporate, symphonic'' identity - ''the then and now'' of their shared life -the Kleeves themselves experience little unity of kinship or purpose. To each of them, love is something that separates as much as it binds: they measure their identity by the distance they've traveled from home and parents and parcel out affection grudgingly - more as blackmail or a sign of weakness than a real show of caring. Forever bickering and exchanging blows, they use their intimate knowledge of one another's habits and verbal stratagems to sabotage the very harmony they say they crave.\nSometimes the violence is physical - wassail bowls are smashed, creche figures broken. Sometimes it is verbal - insults are traded, hurtful truths lobbed. Most of the time, it is simply threatened. People are constantly threatening to leave in this novel: doors are slammed, cars are driven off into the night, and while the departures are usually brief, the prospect of permanent disengagement hangs over the Kleeve household like a stubborn and insidious fog.\nLouise Kleeve, we're told, is constantly on the verge of divorcing her husband, Trover. She is fed up with his refusal to talk about his feelings, disgusted with his penchant for buying unnecessary things - extra cars, unwanted exercise equipment (barbells, lifting bench, punching bag, exercycle, chest expander, gravity boots and the like), unread self-help books and unused carpentry tools. As for Trover, he says he's nearly had it with Louise's nagging. He is tired of her messiness and alienation; and her frequently flouted knowledge of his weaknesses scares him further into withdrawal. ''You're always counting something, calories, reps, heartbeats,'' she says to him one evening. ''God, he thought. Unmasked again. She kept summing him up in ever shorter sentences. You're always counting something. Four words. He'd have to change, reshuffle himself, burrow deeper into his own mystery.''\nCaught in the crossfire between their parents are the two Kleeve children: the feisty, no-nonsense Mighty (nee Mary Ann) and her melancholic brother, Michael, a high-school wrestling champ. ''Louise saw her children then, and she saw them now,'' writes Ms. Stark. ''The days between carried too much muddy weather to see through. Things changed as you slept. While you were digging dirt out of grooves and flirting with poets and botany, your children traded natures like baseball cards.''\nAs she demonstrated in a previous collection of fiction (''The Dealers' Yard and Other Stories''), Ms. Stark has a talent for finding those moments in which hidden currents of feeling gather themselves into startling emotional eddies; and she demonstrates a knack as well for making the physical world yield handfuls of glittering similes and metaphors. Louise looks at Trover and realizes that ''hurt always bleached the blue from his eyes.'' And Trover attempts to hide from his sorrows in bed, hoping ''sleep would burn up grief like diesel.''\nYet as often as Ms. Stark's poetic prose succeeds in moving us, it just as frequently bloats into static overwriting. ''There was bile in his heart and cold in the crypt that was his stomach, and he rode a tractor inadequate to its task,'' she writes of one character. And she has another character actually utter these words: ''There I was, staring into endless, measureless everything, and all around me the simple finitudes were piling up.''\nThe self-conscious, writerly feeling of ''A Wrestling Season'' is not confined to its prose, but also extends to its overall thematic patterning. The title itself refers to the sport favored by the Kleeve's son, Michael; but it is also meant as a kind of extended metaphor for the squabbling engaged in by all the family's members. Similarly, Louise Kleeve's hobby -sculpting clay figurines, arranged in awkward family groupings - is meant to comment on their own precarious kinship: a stiffness in their carriage represents the Kleeves's difficulties in communication; broken and cracked limbs, their own emotional damage.\nThere is a dangerous cuteness in such conceits; and as ''A Wrestling Season'' progresses, its whimsy grows more and more annoying, to the point where the novel begins to read like a pastiche of bad John Updike and bad John Irving. Instead of using her lyrical gifts to give the reader a sustained sense of her characters' interior lives, the author increasingly settles for nestling occasional emotional epiphanies in a wordy matrix of domestic sentiment and jokey set pieces. As Trover's buying sprees and family feuds take on the slapstick feel of a television game show, the characters start to resemble the corny figurines sculpted by Louise - and the reader ends by wondering why he should care about them or their problems. It's an unfortunate comment on a novel that contains such encouraging moments.

It was the best performance since the blue-chip index rose more than 43 points on Dec. 2.\n''It's nice to get off to a good start,'' one trader said.\nMore important to others was that the rally began to answer some important questions as to why the market had been stumbling of late.\n''I think it's a big relief that the tremendous weakness in the broad market that we've seen in the last couple of weeks was, absolutely, tax selling,'' said Jon Groveman, a market analyst with Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. ''The test will come Monday.''\nThe broader market did even better than the Dow. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,483 issues that rose in price, compared with only 164 that declined. A Fast Start\nMarket analysts have been predicting that 1987 will be a good year for the stock market if interest rates fall or remain at current levels, and corporate profits improve.\nBut the general feeling was that stock prices would perform best later in the year, when many experts see business conditions improving. Yesterday, however, those on Wall Street who showed up for the first session of the year seemed eager to get the ball rolling.\nAfter just 30 minutes of trading, the Dow was up 22 points. The fast start, experts said, was inspired in part by an improvement in bond prices. But especially helpful was a sharp jump in the price of stock index futures.\n''The futures opened at huge premiums to the stocks,'' said Donald Selkin of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''So the price of stocks had to be re-evaluated upward to put them in line with the futures.''\nOften when the prices of stock index futures become too high, investors switch gears, buying stocks and selling the futures. That, analysts said, was what happened yesterday morning.\nThe Dow's move yesterday nearly salvaged the holiday-shortened week, with the index losing just 3.09 points in the last four trading days.\nStandard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.28 points yesterday, to 246.45, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.43, to 141.01. Volume Low\nThe average share was up 65 cents. Trading volume, however, dropped to 91.9 million shares from Wednesday's 139.2 million. The day after New Year's, however, proved to be a much busier session than the day after Christmas, when fewer than 49 million shares changed hands.\nLaszlo Birinyi, manager of equity market analysis for Salomon Brothers, believes a lot of the trading volume on Wednesday and earlier in the week came from investors trying to beat the change in the capital gains tax rate.\nOn Wednesday, for instance, odd-lot trades, which generally are made by small investors, accounted for 1.5 percent of the total volume, according to Mr. Birinyi. Normally, he said, these small trades account for less than 1 percent of the activity.\nMarket experts had been predicting that investors, faced with a higher tax rate on their capital gains under the new tax law, would be heavy sellers of stock before the end of 1986.\nAnd while the harmful effect on the market was not as large as many had predicted, there was a sense during the last few weeks that Wall Street was facing an uphill struggle until the year ended. The Dow did fall in the three final sessions of 1986. Volatility Expected\n''I think you will still have a year of high volatility,'' said Alan Ackerman of Herzfeld & Stern. ''The key to the market in 1987 is going to be interest rates.'' Also helpful, he said, will be low inflation and plenty of cash looking for a place to be invested.\nThe three most heavily traded issues yesterday will all be traded ex-dividend on Monday. Public Service of Colorado topped the active list, rising 1/8, to 18 7/8, on consolidated volume of 7 million shares. Second was BellSouth, up 1 7/8, to 59 5/8. Illinois Power, third, was unchanged at 29 3/8.\nLower interest rates also helped other former A.T.&T. companies. Southwest Bell gained 1 7/8, to 114 1/8, in active trading, while Nynex rose 1 5/8, to 65 3/4. There is also a feeling on Wall Street that these companies will soon be permitted to enter new businesses and receive rate increases.\nI.B.M., which had been leading the market lower recently, reversed direction yesterday, climbing 2 points, to 122.\nMerck rose 2 1/8, to 126.

452	UNIONS PRESSURING CHIRAC AS RAIL STRIKE GOES ON	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DC1739F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: With rail workers rejecting Government proposals to end a crippling 15-day-old strike, a battle of wills seemed to be shaping up today between the main leftist French labor unions and the conservative Government of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac.\nWith rail workers rejecting Government proposals to end a crippling 15-day-old strike, a battle of wills seemed to be shaping up today between the main leftist French labor unions and the conservative Government of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac.\nSome political analysts said today that the unions, sensing that the Government was vulnerable to pressure, were trying to continue the strike in an effort to produce the maximum possible embarrassment to Mr. Chirac.\n''If the strike continues today, it's probably because there are other, more political ambitions for the action,'' said Pierre Mehaignerie, the Transportation Minister.\n''There is certainly - and this seems clear - a desire on the part of some union organizations to call into question the very mission for which the Government was chosen by its electorate,'' he said. A 'Day Without Trains'\nMr. Mehaignerie was speaking after the unions rejected a compromise over what had been the main demand of the strikers - that a proposed salary scale based on merit rather than seniority be withdrawn.\nA Government mediator, Francois Lavondes, said Thursday that the new plan would not be enacted, but union leaders termed the concession inadequate. The rail workers pointed out that Mr. Lavondes did not specifically say that the proposal would be withdrawn, and they said it might be reimposed if they returned to work.\nThe unions called for a ''day without trains'' throughout France today as thousands were making plans to return home after winter vacations.\nIn some places, the police were called out to clear bands of striking workers from tracks and switching centers that they had occupied in an effort to block trains.\nThe state-owned railway system said that it expected only about one in six trains to operate on long routes and one in eight in the Paris suburbs today. 'A Crazy Machine'\n''It's a crazy machine that we no longer control,'' Andre Bergeron, the head of Force Ouvriere, a moderate union that has questioned the continuation of the strike, told Le Monde. He was referring to the occupation of tracks and switching areas.\nRaising the possibility that the strike was ''taking a political turn,'' Mr. Bergeron said, ''Now, I fear everything.''\nThe confrontation between the huge railroad system and striking workers began as a wildcat walkout just over two weeks ago by train drivers opposed to the proposed stress on merit rather than seniority in promotions.\nBut the strike's continuation, which was being urged in particular by the Communist-controlled C.G.T. and another union, the C.F.D.T., has clearly turned into a major political problem for the Government. Seen Aimed at Government\nSpecifically, political analysts say the union action was aimed at weakening the Government, whose prestige had already suffered a sharp loss when student demonstrations a month ago forced it to scrap a major university reform plan.\nThe train strike, in addition to taking a heavy economic toll, has posed a new set of political problems for Mr. Chirac, who governs in an often awkward power-sharing arrangment with President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist.\nMr. Mitterrand met with a delegation of 150 striking workers and their families Thursday at a vacation spot, a gesture that was seen within Mr. Chirac's camp as something close to a provocation.\nJacques Toubon, the head of Mr. Chirac's party, the Rally for the Republic, said Mr. Mitterrand's move was likely to ''reinforce the all-or-nothing attitude of the extremists and thus go against the social peace and cohesion that everybody is seeking.'' Rival Is Strengthened\nMeanwhile, the domination by hard-liners of the rail strike has apparently benefited Mr. Chirac's main rival among the conservatives, former Prime Minister Raymond Barre. Mr. Barre, who like Mr. Chirac is expected to run in presidential elections next year, has argued all along that the power-sharing arrangement with Mr. Mitterrand, which goes by the name cohabitation, was a mistake that would cripple Government action.\nThe student movement and the train strike have given some credibility to Mr. Barre's position. On both occasions, Mr. Mitterrand has discreetly shown his sympathy for the Government's opponents, thereby making it more difficult for Mr. Chirac to resist compromises.\nExplaining their refusal to return to work following the Government's concession on the salary scale, striking workers cited the failure of management to propose an alternative scale. Workers are also demanding longer rest periods between trips and bigger year-end bonuses. Other Strikes Urged\nThe C.G.T., which is particularly strong among the 230,000 employees of the rail system, called today for strikes in other state-owned French enterprises, raising the possibility that the movement could spread.\nThe union called on subway, electricity and post office workers to walk out for 24 hours next week.\n''Yes, the flood is rising, and it's just as well,'' Henri Krasucki, the C.G.T. leader, said Thursday. ''Some are afraid of it, but not the C.G.T. It's our only chance to make ourselves heard.''
453	PROGRAM TRADERS' IMPACT SEEN WANING	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DB1739F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Amid all the factors that cause stocks to rise or fall, program trading of stock index futures now ranks as one of the most potent. But a number of developments are at work that will change the way that game is played and, to some extent, reduce the sharp impact it has had on stock prices.\nAmid all the factors that cause stocks to rise or fall, program trading of stock index futures now ranks as one of the most potent. But a number of developments are at work that will change the way that game is played and, to some extent, reduce the sharp impact it has had on stock prices.\nThe changes include the slimmer margins of profit available for program traders as more and more institutional investors hold futures contracts as much for protection as for profit.\nThere are also signs that a number of leading brokerage houses may introduce a slew of stock index futures products aimed at individual investors. While individuals have always had the opportunity to trade the instruments, so far the markets have been dominated by institutions. New Expiration Times\nAt the same time, because of worries about sharp price swings in stocks, particularly on ''triple witching hour'' Fridays, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange plan to move up the expiration of their stock index futures contracts to the opening of trading on those Fridays from the close.\nPerhaps most important, the coming 12 months will give all investors more time to learn about the instruments and what they can do.\n''This is a market that is still in its adolescence,'' said one futures trader, who asked not to be identified. ''Whenever you have new markets and new strategies, you might have some volatility in the short run, but longer term it will even out.''\nStock index futures - promises to buy or sell shares at a specified price by a given date of the stocks upon which an index is based - have existed only since 1982. Investors who buy an index future are wagering that the market will rise before the contract matures; investors can sell a futures contract if they believe the market is headed down. Wide Institutional Following\nThe instruments have developed a wide following among institutions, which can gain a tremendous amount of exposure to the stock market or buy a big piece of protection for their portfolios at a very low cost.\nFor example, an institutional investor who hedges a $10 million stock portfolio by selling futures contracts based on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would incur commissions of around $1,000. Selling the same amount of stock would cost about $10,000 in commissions.\n''Stock index futures are an enormously valuable product for institutions,'' said Richard Ketchum, director of market regulation at the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''They provide new and more effective hedging techniques at a very low cost. They are good things, but that does not mean we are not concerned about the volatility that may accompany them.''\nIncreasingly, blame for sharp changes in stock prices has been directed at program traders, who attempt to lock in short-term profits by identifying price discrepancies between index futures and the underlying stocks. After the discrepancy is identified, these traders sell whichever is more expensive and buy the one that is cheaper. In Wall Street parlance, the technique is called index arbitrage. New Investors in Index Futures\nBut in the last 12 months a new type of institutional investor has discovered the value of stock index futures. The participation of these institutions, whose strategies are primarily defensive, has narrowed the spread between the price of the futures and the underlying stocks, cutting into the potential profit of those who make index arbitrage trades.\n''There are two types of ways that stock index futures can be used,'' said Andrew Harmstone-Rakowski, a vice president at J. P. Morgan Investment Management. ''One is as an investment strategy, like portfolio protection, and second as an arbitrage. There is no question that the former usage has gone up significantly in the past year and will continue to go up.''\nCourtney D. Smith, a vice president and director of futures at the Twenty-First Securities Corporation, said that ''a year ago arbitragers frequently could pick up a guaranteed 13 to 16 percent rate of return on an index arbitrage.'' But, he added, ''Now it is very difficult to get much more than the prevailing rate on three-month Treasury bills.''\nUntil last year, it was generally believed that most of the effects on stock prices caused by the use of stock index futures were confined to the ''triple witching hour,'' one day every three months when stock index futures, stock index options and individual stock options all expire.\nOn such days, stock prices tend to fluctuate wildly, as individuals and institutions who hold the contracts exercise their last chance to make a profit before the contracts expire. 85 Million Shares at the Bell ''Triple witching'' days still pack that potential. On Dec. 19, for examples, 85 million shares, or more than $3 billion worth of stock, changed hands on the closing bell. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up 6 points at 3:59 P.M., shot up another 10 points at the close.\nBut the use of stock index futures has grown so rapidly - volume in 1986 was more than six times what it was just four years ago - that sharp moves can occur on ordinary trading days as well. That fact was driven home on Sept. 11 and Sept. 12, when the Dow fell by more than 120 points, its worst two-day plunge ever.\nThe S.E.C. recently completed a study of what drove down prices so much in September. ''We didn't find that index futures were an underlying problem on those days,'' Mr. Ketchum said. ''They clearly had an impact, but nothing we now know suggests that the 11th and the 12th were the result of speculative binges.''\nA number of studies, in fact, have shown that prices are not really any more volatile now than they were a decade or two ago. In a recent article, economists from the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company noted that ''even in 1986, stock-price volatility - when viewed, as it should be, in percentage terms rather than in terms of absolute changes - has not been out of line with other periods in the last decade and a half.''\nNevertheless, the sight of institutions, which the Morgan economists say now account for between 80 and 90 percent of all trading on the New York Stock Exchange, jumping in and out of the futures and stock markets may have a negative effect on individual investors, who see themselves as too small and too unsophisticated to participate in the action.\nBut that perception may change in the coming year. A number of firms, including Kidder, Peabody & Company, are rumored to be on the brink of introducing new stock index futures funds for the public.\n''What we have done is turn the marketplace away from the public and into an institutional playground,'' said Jack Barbanel, director of futures trading at Gruntal & Company. ''The key is to give the public something that makes them feel that they are in tune with the professionals.''

He was 63 years old.\nMr. Hirkala, a Democrat, had just left a party in honor of the city clerk of Passaic when he was stricken while sitting in his parked car.\nMr. Hirkala had served in city government for 37 years, 9 of them as city clerk, before stepping down last year.\nHe was elected to the New Jersey Assembly in 1968, and served there for four years before winning election to the Senate in 1972.\nIn the Senate, Mr. Hirkala served as assistant minority leader, majority whip, assistant majority leader and president pro tempore.\nBorn in Passaic, Mr. Hirkala attended public schools there, before joining the Navy at 17. He was discharged in 1945.\nBefore his entry into state politics, Mr. Hirkala served as city clerk, assistant tax assessor and registrar of vital statistics in Passaic.\nSenator Carmen Orechio, Democrat of Nutley, said that Mr. Hirkala, the father of two retarded children, ''championed the cause of the handicapped'' and was ''concerned for the urban poor, children and the elderly.''\nHe is survived by his wife, Josephine; a daughter, Karen, and a son, Robert, both of Passaic.
455	TV: GROWING CORPORATE TOOL	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DA1739F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Companies, always eager to turn cost centers into profit centers, are trying to make greater use of their television operations.\nCompanies, always eager to turn cost centers into profit centers, are trying to make greater use of their television operations.\nTelevision first made its appearance in the business world to save commuting to meetings - staging corporate conferences was one frequent use. Now, however, companies are beginning to produce programming for sale to subsidiaries, to each other and even to the armed forces.\nSpecialized programming is now available on such diverse topics as semiconductor technology, accounting and new surgical techniques. As more and more programs are developed, television is emerging as a more important tool in marketing, management and training. To help corporate viewers sift through the programs bombarding their satellite dishes, one company is even offering a guide. Penney's Has Its Own Network\nOne of the more aggressive players in the new market for business television is the J. C. Penney Company, which originally installed its own satellite network so that its corporate buyers could more easily show new products to its 1,600 regional store managers.\nNow, however, Penney's is using the same equipment to produce programming for sale to other companies through a new subsidiary, seeking to capitalize on its own business experience and convenient midtown Manhattan location, ''We are business communicators ourselves,'' said Russell Longyear, the president of JCPenney Communications, who says the unit has been profitable for several months. ''We are able to offer personnel who understand how to deal with other companies' needs.''\nThe company has begun to diversify its offerings, Mr. Longyear said. ''We are interested in generating unique or original programming that would have a wide customer potential,'' he added.\nWith that goal in mind, Penney's recently broadcast to its staff a production dealing with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. It was sold to others for $65 per viewer, as opposed to the flat rate charged by others. Live Programs\nMuch of the new business programming is live rather than on tape. Live broadcasts are less costly and they permit phoned-in questions, which make the programs more dynamic, according to William C. Graves, director of communications for Computerland Inc., the largest computer retail chain. ''It becomes a call-in show, almost like a religious broadcast,'' he said.\nPart of the excitement of live shows, Mr. Graves added, is that ''anything can go wrong at any time.'' Computerland has done more than 30 live broadcasts - most of them aimed at franchise owners and sales representatives - and finds them an effective educational tool. But at one recent broadcast for customers, ''The Power User,'' only two callers responded from the 20 sites receiving the show.\n''There's an aspect in which you can be seduced into playing around with expensive equipment,'' noted Mr. Graves, who said that a show generally cost $4,000 to $8,000 to produce. ''If it doesn't make sense, if people aren't watching, then we aren't going to do it.'' Calling on a Customer\nOther companies have had good results in using television to focus on specific customers. The Hewlett-Packard Company, which pioneered the use of video as a training tool in 1967, now uses its satellite network to make live customer visits.\n''This is a new way of approaching a sales call,'' said Marika Ruumet, manager of HP-TV Network. ''You can go into the board room and simultaneously into the offices of the people who will really be affected by the purchase. Done live, it really puts people on the spot.''\nBut with 84,000 employees, Hewlett-Packard's major use for television remains training. While an initial $25,000 investment in television has grown to several million dollars and 34 full-time employees, HP-TV functions as a separate company and must bid competitively for jobs within Hewlett-Packard. The network has also found an outside market for its product, selling basic electronics films to customers including the United States Army. Managerial TV Stars\nCompanies differ on whether to use professional actors or employees in business television. Hewlett-Packard does both. ''There is visibility and impact when you reach a number of people in your company at the same time,'' Miss Ruumet said. ''Middle managers and top executives are going to have to learn television skills.''\nMarc Porat, president of Private Satellite Network Inc., puts it more strongly. ''Television is now coming to the world of business management in the way it came to politics in the 1960's,'' he said, adding that business people who do not relate to TV might face some career difficulties.\nPrivate Satellite Network is just one of several companies hoping to take advantage of the growing popularity of business television. The company provides equipment and programming for such blue-chip clients as Merrill Lynch, J.C. Penney and I.B.M., and also offers networks for lawyers and institutional investors.\n''Only about 25 companies understand'' business television today, Mr. Porat said. ''But we are in the dawn of something that in 10 years will be trite.'' Growth Foreseen\nAnother concern that sees an opportunity is the Telespan Publishing Company, whose president, Elliot Gold, said that by the end of the year there would be more than 36 ''networks,'' equipped with production and transmission facilities, broadcasting daytime business television to more than 7,000 viewing locations with satellite dishes.\n''The earth stations are out there, and most teleconferencing sites are used less than one hour a day,'' Mr. Gold said. ''The people with programming know they can reach those sites.''\nTelespan, in its own way, is seeking to capitalize on the wealth of programs becoming available. The company is just mailing its second issue of BusinessTV, a publication that it calls ''the TV Guide for corporate America.'' Mr. Gold himself solicits listings for the publication.\nMr. Gold's company, based in Altadena, Calif., has covered the teleconferencing market for several years in another publication, a newsletter called Telespan. ''To me, business television is where we were in the early 1950's when people had no idea what programming was available, and we needed TV Guide.'' he said.

The report made a sharp downward revision in the October estimate, which was originally depicted as a gain of 1.6 percent. Construction spending was unchanged in September and has not shown an increase since August.\nAnalysts said the new figures more accurately reflected what was happening as the new tax law and overbuilding put a damper on construction activity. 'One of Weakest Sectors'\n''Construction is going to be one of the weakest sectors of the economy,'' predicted Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting concern.\nThe tax law, which took effect on Thursday, removes many of the tax shelter advantages from real estate investment and reduces depreciation benefits. However, buildings completed and occupied before Jan. 1 could qualify for the more lucrative tax treatment of the old law.\nThe report said residential construction fell by three-tenths of 1 percent in November, to an annual rate of $178 billion. A rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in multifamily dwellings offset a a two-tenths drop in construction of single-family homes. Multifamily Drops Seen\nAnalysts said the decline in single-family construction was a reflection of lower sales of new homes in recent months. They said activity in this area should pick up with the recent further declines in mortgage rates. However, they predicted big decreases in multifamily construction.\nNonresidential construction fell five-tenths of 1 percent in November, to an annual rate of $91.6 billion, following a 1.3 percent drop in October.\nOffice construction fell 1.5 percent in November, while factory construction was off 1.6 percent and hotel and motel activity was unchanged. Only construction of shopping centers and other commercial buildings showed improvement among the major nonresidential categories, rising by three-tenths of 1 percent.\nConstruction of public buildings fell 1.7 percent in November. Spending for highways, the biggest single category, was off 5.4 percent.

But many analysts said the November gain was influenced by temporary factors, such as the new tax law, that offered little evidence that manufacturers will enjoy increased demand in 1987.\nIn another report in which the tax law was a factor, the Commerce Department said construction spending fell by seven-tenths of 1 percent in November, the second consecutive monthly drop. Analysts said the figures reflected what was happening as the tax law and overbuilding dampened building activity. [ Page 32. ] November's increase in new orders was led by the largest one-month rise in military orders in 12 years, a 107.9 percent surge that reflected heavy demand for aircraft. The big increase, which followed a 43.4 percent decline in October, left military orders at $10.4 billion.\n''Even though the overall number looks impressive, when you look more closely it completely evaporates,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting concern. ''It isn't telling us anything about future strength.''\nWithout the military increase, orders would have gone up by a much smaller 1.13 percent in November, and some analysts said even this gain was overstating future economic strength.\nThey attributed much of the advance in the civilian categories to a last-minute rush by businesses to buy and take delivery on capital equipment to qualify for higher tax benefits that expired on Jan. 1. Negative Growth Rate Seen\nMr. Evans said he believed the economy limped along at a 1.5 percent annual growth rate in the just-completed October-December quarter and he said growth in the January-March period would slump to a negative 1 percent, as businesses and consumers cut back on spending with the advent of the new tax law.\nNonmilitary capital spending climbed 6.4 percent as businesses placed rush orders to qualify for more lucrative tax treatment under the old law. Business capital spending to expand and modernize had fallen 4.6 percent in October.\nTwo-thirds of the $7.9 billion increase in orders occurred in the durable goods sector, which rose by 5.5 percent in November. In an advance report 10 days ago, the Government had put the increase in durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, at a slightly higher 5.9 percent. Transportation Equipment Up\nOrders for transportation equipment rose 15.9 percent, powered by an 85.3 percent increase in the aircraft and missile category. Without the big increase in military orders, demand in the transportation category would have fallen 6.3 percent.\nMachinery orders were up 12.2 percent, led by a 16.2 percent rise in orders for office equipment.\nOrders for nondurable goods rose 2.5 percent, to $91.15 billion, after having fallen 1.9 percent in October.\nShipments of manufactured goods rose 1 percent, to $198.2 billion, with two-thirds of the $2 billion rise attributed to a pickup in shipments of military goods.

But in practice, court adminsitrators say, judges have seldom chosen to impose fines.\nLast month, however, a case in which a judge had imposed such a penalty came before the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals. In its ruling, the court said there should be guidelines stating what level of fine is merited by which behavior. The ruling instructed the State Office of Court Administration to draft guidelines as quickly as possible.\n''It's going to change the rules of the game a lot,'' said Matthew T. Crosson, the deputy chief administrator of the courts. ''It will give judges much more power to control their caseloads.''\nAdministration officials said it was difficult to say how stiff the penalties might be. One state law already on the books, however -which only covers personal injury suits - allows fines of up to $10,000.\n''If we're going to have a meaningful sanction, it will have to be more than a token amount,'' said the counsel to the state Office of Court Administration, Michael Colodner.\nA spokesman for the City Bar Association, however, warned that forming the guidelines, a job that administrators will start this month and hope to complete next month, will not be easy.\n''It's going to take some time and a great deal of thought,'' said the chairman of the Association's Committee on Professional Discipline, Stanley S. Arkin. ''There are lawyers who abuse the process,'' he said, but ''you don't want to inhibit novel and creative lawsuits.'' Stacking Courthouses\nA joint city-state committee studying the problems of New York City's crowded court buildings is considering a uniquely New York solution for at least one site: building on top of an existing courthouse.\nCommittee members say engineering studies are under way on a proposal to add as many as four stories to an eight-story, 57-year-old building at 80 Centre Street in lower Manhattan, which is currently used for courts and state offices.\nMembers of the committee say the proposal, part of a $200 million capital improvements project pledged by Mayor Koch last August, illustrates the difficulty they face in trying to expand and improve courts in the congested areas where most of the city's court buildings are situated.\n''Finding new land in Manhattan is going to be difficult, if not impossible,'' said a member of the committee, Harvey W. Spectre, a deputy budget director at the city's Office of Management and Budget.\nMr. Spectre said construction on the 80 Centre Street site could begin next year if the project is found to be feasible. Jurors' Identities\nMore and more court clerks and judges are refusing requests from reporters and the public for the names of jurors in highly publicized trials, administrators say. The reason: a recent appeals court ruling that said they are not required to provide the names.\nThe ruling, by an Appellate Division panel in Brooklyn, resulted from one of the first legal challenges to a 1978 state law that called such information ''confidential'' and only subject to release by order of the Appellate Division. Administrators said the ruling has been circulated to clerks in courtrooms across the state.\nWhether such rules are needed and will be universally applied in courts throughout the state are still subjects of debate.\n''In my experience, there's very little harassment of jurors,'' Justice Peter J. McQuillan, administrative judge of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said. New Post, Cold Shoulder\nNew York State's first Director of the Office of Security Services is expected to be named sometime next week, but court administrators say he will likely get a cold welcome from many members of the current court security force.\nThe reason, administrators and court security officials say, is the long-simmering opposition among many unionized court workers to the idea of a court security office in general and to this particular administrative version.\nA key conflict, they say, is that court clerks, who have traditionally supervised in-court security, are not to be considered for promotion to the supervisory jobs that are to be created under the direction of the state security chief. Instead, the supervisor's jobs - there are to be at least six deputies or assistant directors -are reserved for uniformed court officers.\n''We wanted to give them a career ladder,'' said Mr. Crosson at the Office of Court Administration, referring to the uniformed officers. ''But it's been a real mess.'' ''This is just the first shot,'' said Robert W. Olivari Jr., spokesman for the New York State Court Clerks Association, referring to the director's appointment.\n''Are we going to continue to oppose it?'' he said. ''Definitely yes.''

In doing so, they recouped some of their declines of earlier in the week.\nSpurred by a sharp drop in short-term interest rates and some weaker than expected economic statistics, prices of Treasury notes and bond rose modestly yesterday. In doing so, they recouped some of their declines of earlier in the week.\nFinancial analysts expected that the upward pressure on rates would quickly subside once the credit markets got past the many disruptions at year-end. Besides the unusual flows of funds caused by the efforts of banks and other institutions to present a more favorable balance sheet on Dec. 31, bankers said, there was extra upward pressure on rates from the rush to complete many asset sales and other transactions before the new tax bill took effect on New Year's Day.\nYesterday, however, the upward pressures on rates subsided quickly. Short-Term Rates Tumble\nThe overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market fell to about 6 3/8 percent, from 16.17 percent on Tuesday and 14.35 percent on Wednesday. Other short-term rates also declined, with 30-day commercial paper falling from about 7.70 percent on Wednesday, to 6.15 percent, and three-month Treasury bills falling about an eighth of a percentage point, to 5.56 percent.\nThe decline in short-term interest rates - which reduced the overnight cost of financing government securities from as high as 18 percent on Wednesday to 6 1/8 percent yesterday - was widely expected, but was still a relief for securities dealers that hold large inventories of recently auctioned Treasury notes due in two, four and seven years. The cost of financing inventories of other securities also declined, as leading banks reduced their broker loan rates to 7 1/4 percent or 7 1/2 percent, from 17 percent or 18 percent on Wednesday.\nBy 2 P.M., when trading in the Treasury market stopped, the 7 1/2 percent bonds due in 2016 were up nearly 1 point and were offered at 101 1/8 to yield 7.40 percent, while the recently auctioned 7 percent notes due in 1994 were offered at 100 3/32, up 17/32, to yield 6.98 percent, up from about 99 1/2 at Tuesday's auction.\nSecurities dealers said that besides the drop in short-term interest rates, prices were helped yesterday by the Commerce Department's report of a decline of seven-tenths of 1 percent in construction spending in November and a revision of October's data to show a decline of eight-tenths of 1 percent instead of the 1.6 percent increase previously reported. Growth Forecast Reduced\nAnalysts at Money Market Services, a Belmont, Calif., economic analysis firm, said that ''large downward revisions in today's construction spending data and weakness in the merchandise trade report'' had led them to reduce their forecast for fourth-quarter economic growth after inflation to 1.4 percent from 2.5 percent.\nLast Wednesday, the Commerce Department's report of a record trade deficit for November of more than $19 billion was a disappointment to some analysts who had expected a smaller deficit.\n''Anything suggesting the economy is growing at less than 2 percent, or not at all, will heighten expectations that the Fed will ease some time in the first quarter,'' one Treasury note trader said. Yesterday's trading was not active enough to provide a clear sign of the market's expectations, he said, adding that many participants are looking ahead to the December employment data scheduled for publication next Friday.\nCREDIT MARKETS
463	JOB SEEKERS AWAIT JAPANESE AUTO PLANT IN INDIANA	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DC1439F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Things have not been the same in this western Indiana town since two Japanese manufacturers said they would build an automobile plant on some cornfields near the Wabash River.\nThings have not been the same in this western Indiana town since two Japanese manufacturers said they would build an automobile plant on some cornfields near the Wabash River.\nThe plant is now only lines on paper, but developers are already making inquiries with the municipality about building shopping malls and pizza stands. People are coming from as far away as Florida for jobs that will not start until 1989. Town officials, used to dealing with Indiana storekeepers, are memorizing Japanese salutations.\nOn Dec. 2, Fuji Heavy Industries and Isuzu Motors announced they would build a $500 million assembly plant that would employ 1,700 people and would be making a quarter of a million vehicles a year by the mid-1990's.\nBut talk of plans for such a plant spread long before the announcement was made, and people started calling the local employment office about jobs in September, officials said. Attention From All Over\nLike other small towns where Japanese companies have announced plans to build factories, Lafayette drew instant attention. It is now grappling with requests and offers of all kinds, from contractors wanting a hand in the construction to newly arrived job seekers looking for a place to live.\nIn Bloomington, Ill., where a joint Mitsubishi and Chrysler plant is to open in late 1988, jobless families have trickled in from Texas and Florida in the mistaken belief that the plant is already hiring. One Bloomington shelter for the homeless has been full of such migrant families since late summer, said Tina Sipula, the shelter's director.\nIn Georgetown, Ky., the job inquiries started the day Toyota announced it would be opening a plant there. Now, a year later, 50,000 resumes are on file for 1,400 jobs at a plant that will not open until 1988. ''Someone even applied from the Republic of China,'' said Helen Flowers, a manager at the local employment office. ''And we got at least one from Hawaii.''\nRick Eli, a construction worker from Florida, heard rumors about the Lafayette plant and drove up here in the fall. So far he has been taking temporary construction jobs, hoping to find enough work to carry him until the plant gets to the point where sandblasters are needed. Biggest Thing Since Purdue\n''I'll have plenty to do till they're ready for people like me,'' Mr. Eli said. '' I'll be doing everything from carpentry to plumbing.'' Sandblasters will not be hired for a year or so, but Mr. Eli checks the site anyway to see how things are coming along.\nSome people consider the plant the biggest thing to happen to Lafayette since Purdue University opened here in 1865. Lafayette is in the center of Tippecanoe County, where Gen. William Henry Harrison defeated the Indians in 1811 and got the slogan for his 1840 Presidential campaign, ''Tippecanoe and Tyler, too,'' a reference to the battle and his running-mate, John Tyler.\nAlthough a local radio program received a few snide calls about Pearl Harbor right after the announcement that the Japanese plant would be built, most Lafayette officials are embracing all things Japanese. A group of them are planning a trip to the Japanese Embassy in Washington and to New York City to try sushi at a sushi bar.\n''I've never had it before,'' said Mark Davis, president of Greater Lafayette Progress, Inc., an economic development group, ''but I'm going to learn to like it.''\nGordon Kingma, executive vice president of the Lafayette Chamber of Commerce, has been carrying a pocket Japanese dictionary around with him for months. ''The only thing I know so far is good morning,'' Mr. Kingma said. ''That will get me to the afternoon.'' His office has been fielding calls from all over the country, from a woman in Dallas representing an executive search concern, from a Houston developer who wanted to build a shopping center, ''and a fellow from North Dakota called and asked if there would be room to build a Taco John,'' Mr. Kingma said. ''We're trying to keep a file of all these people.'' Green Tea and Annual Reports\nAll this is a result of years in which high state officials courted the Japanese and sat through ceremonial meetings that, the officials said, took a little getting used to.\n''You drink green tea, exchange gifts, they tell you what a fine state you have, and you say what a fine company they have, because you've read the annual report,'' said Lieut. Gov. John Mutz of Indiana, who was the state's chief negotiator in the deal. ''It takes years to get the thing done.''\nIndiana was repeatedly passed over as the Japanese opened automobile plants in neighoring states, but once the Lafayette deal was official, Gov. Robert D. Orr gave the Japanese representatives an enthusiastic welcome. ''Your state government - since you are now corporate citizens of Indiana - will support you as you grow and prosper,'' he said.''\nNot everyone is as optimistic. ''There are still going to be poor people sleeping under the bridge,'' said Mary Bays, an unemployed laundress who has been staying at a homeless shelter.

''Primarily, the new material includes letters written to him. Many of Franklin's own letters were destroyed by the British when they were in Philadelphia at the same time that he was in France.''\nThe letters and documents pull together all the known material, to and from Franklin, in English and French, that has been found in archives here and abroad about his activities in France from Oct. 1, 1777, through Feb. 28, 1778.\nDuring this period, when the 71-year-old Franklin effectively headed the three-man American mission to Paris, he achieved the most important success of his career for the new united (still a small ''u'' in some of these documents) States: French-American treaties of amity, commerce and general alliance. Historians have pointed out that these treaties were turning points - in the war on and off the battlefields as well as on the high seas - that led to eventual success in the rebellion by the American colonies against Britain.\n''Franklin was enough of a diplomat to realize that the treaties could be attained because they also fit into France's own plans and position in European affairs,'' Mrs. Oberg said. She succeeded William B. Willcox, who was editor of the Franklin Papers for 15 years until his death in 1985. A Renaissance Man\nThe personal and official papers reveal Franklin to be a Renaissance man: writer, philosopher, scientist and above all - especially at this perilous moment in the fight for independence by civilians under arms against professional British soldiers and German mercenaries - a brilliant statesman.\nAs if these talents were not enough, he was simultaneously ''Mon Cher Papa'' to the ladies of Paris. That is the title of a separate Yale University Press volume written by Claude-Anne Lopez, one of the longtime editors of the Franklin Papers.\nMrs. Lopez cited a passage from one of the letters written to him by Anne-Louise Brillon de Jouy, ''Do you know, my dear papa, that people have criticized the sweet habit I have taken of sitting on your lap, and your habit of soliciting from me what I always refuse?''\nShe wrote 103 letters to him; he wrote 29 letters to her (they wrote to each other only in French). ''The verb aimer flew back and forth between them more than a thousand times in all its modes and tenses,'' Mrs. Lopez said. It is significant that Franklin was also friendly with her husband, Brillon de Jouy, a Government official who was a go-between for French merchants selling weapons to the hard-pressed American colonies.\nIn one letter Franklin alluded to a game of chess played in Mrs. Brillon's bathroom while she soaked in the tub. ''Of course, bathtubs in those days were covered with a wooden plank,'' Mrs. Lopez observed. ''To murder Marat in his tub, Charlotte Corday had to lose her life, not her modesty.'' The Agreeable Ladies\nOf his many social relationships -in between raising money and arms for his countrymen - Franklin himself told his stepniece: ''Somebody gave it out that I lov'd Ladies; and then every body presented me their Ladies (or the Ladies presented themselves) to be embrac'd, that is to have their Necks kissed. For as to kissing of Lips or Cheeks it is not the Mode here, the first is reckon'd rude, and the other may rub off the Paint. The French Ladies have however 1,000 other ways of rendering themselves agreeable.''\nThe Franklin Paper editors point out that Volume 25 opens in despondency and closes in elation. Through October and November of 1777, the American mission was not making any real progress in drawing the French deeper into the Revolution. British columns were drawing closer to Albany and Philadelphia. One plan of financing the American war with the sale of tobacco had evaporated. The French remained noncommittal about an independent treaty with the Americans.\nFranklin and his fellow commissioners needed money to pay for arms and provisions. ''The total Failure of Remittances has embarass'd us exceedingly,'' they wrote home to the Committee for Foreign Affairs. ''The Contracts we enter'd into for Clothing and Arms in Expectation of those Remittances and which are now beginning to call for Payment distress us much, and we are in imminent Danger of Bankruptcy.''\nAt the same time, Franklin's health caused him some distress. Describing his ailments at ''near 72 Years,'' he wrote to a physician, ''Subject to slight Fits of the Gout at long Intervals; was accustomed to what is called good Living, used but little Exercise, being from the Nature of his Employment, as well as from Love of Books, much in his Chamber writing or reading.'' The Turn of the Tide\nOn Dec. 4, 1777, a year and a day after Franklin's arrival in France, news reached Paris of Gen. John Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga. That turned the tide. The documents disclose that the French Foreign Minister, Charles Gravier Vergennes, then received permission to open negotiations for the treaties with the Americans.\n''A chain of hope now ran from the French ministers to the commissioners and then to Congress and the American people,'' the editors note. ''Franklin's position changed, and his way of life within it. He was seen more in public and started to show his human side. He attended a meeting of the Royal Academy of Sciences for the first time in 12 months. He delivered gifts of his newly translated work, 'Way to Wealth.' He gave a party to celebrate the 13 states. When he appeared at the opera or the theater, crowds acclaimed him. At a ball, the ladies swarmed around to embrace him despite the glasses on his nose.''\nIn one document, Franklin sent words to summer soldiers and doubters of the American Revolution: ''We must remember that the Revolution was not directed by the leaders of faction, but by the opinion and voice of the majority of the people; that the grounds and principles upon which it were formed were known, weighed and approved by every individual of that majority.''\nA few years later, Franklin, having done so much to help win the war, envisioned the next stage for the United States. To Josiah Quincy, on Sept. 11, 1783, he wrote an often-quoted line, ''There never was a good war or a bad peace.''

It has daily newspapers in every Australian state capital.\nFour weeks ago, the Herald board agreed to endorse the Murdoch bid, but on Dec. 24, Mr. Holmes a Court made an offer of cash or securities in a little-known company, J. N. Taylor Holdings Ltd.\nMr. Murdoch and many analysts argued that the Murdoch offer, in securities, offered a better value to shareholders.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Holmes a Court increased his cash offer, to $13.50 (Australian) from $13, and augmented his securities offer. (The Australian dollar is currently worth about 66 cents in United States currency.) Mr. Holmes a Court also lowered his condition for a minimum share purchase, to 56 percent from 90 percent.\nMr. Murdoch, who arrived in Australia this week from the United States, visited Herald directors Thursday. He said he would not increase his offer but would take it directly to shareholders. ''We will regroup and consider,'' he said, adding that he might pursue legal action against the Herald board.\nThere has been considerable speculation that if Mr. Holmes a Court succeeds in his bid, he would sell parts of the Herald Group to Mr. Murdoch's Australian rival, John Fairfax Ltd.\nMr. Murdoch began his publishing empire in Australia and the takeover would make him by far the biggest newspaper proprietor in Australia, with control of 75 percent of the country's major daily newspapers. In the United States, Mr. Murdoch owns sizable broadcasting and publishing holdings, including The New York Post and The Boston Herald.\nCOMPANY NEWS

He has dashed over the Cleveland Stadium turf, he has fought the wind from the open end facing Lake Erie, and he has slithered past tacklers. And he likes what he has done. So today's American Football Conference divisional playoff between the Jets and the Cleveland Browns will bring the singular McNeil over familiar territory.\nFreeman McNeil has already played the game in his head. He has dashed over the Cleveland Stadium turf, he has fought the wind from the open end facing Lake Erie, and he has slithered past tacklers. And he likes what he has done. So today's American Football Conference divisional playoff between the Jets and the Cleveland Browns will bring the singular McNeil over familiar territory. ''I try to simulate in my mind what's going to take place in certain situations,'' he explained. ''In addition to the team game plan, I also make up a game plan of my own in my head. So I have two game plans.''\nAnd is his own game plan accurate?\n''Usually, I'm about 89 percent right,'' he said.\nIt is best not to question McNeil about that figure - or any other figures he comes up with. For McNeil seems to be the only player who understands the peculiar ways in which he analyzes life, or football, or a combination of both. Take this game. Pat Ryan will be the Jets' quarterback for the second straight playoff game, but he said the team will go only as far as McNeil carried it. McNeil, said Coach Joe Walton, was the ''pulse'' of the offense.\nAnd McNeil talked continually about team effort and the job of his line.\nThe truth is, the Jets need another big game out of McNeil, who has produced three straight 100-yard performances. Ryan is at his best when McNeil is running and the quarterback can then execute the no-mistake, short-range offense that leads to first downs, clock-killing, a potential Jets victory.\nIt has taken virtually a whole season for McNeil to hit his stride of other years. Significantly, McNeil has done it in December. Once, that had been his cruelest month. Coming into the season, he achieved a 100-yard rushing performance only once in a game in December.\nThis season he had been able to generate a 100-yard game only once, against the Indianapolis Colts, in the first 10 he played. In those 10 appearances, he averaged only 61 yards a game, 3.3 yards a carry.\nIt had been a season in which, in the second game, he suffered a horrifying accident in which his right elbow popped out of its socket when he landed on it - and then popped back in.\nHe missed four games, but it has been only lately that he is running like the old McNeil. The injury took most of the season to heal, even though he returned a few weeks sooner than doctors had predicted.\nThat accident, he now admits, had depressed him, making him consider ending his career. But in a sense, it also rejuvenated him.\n''At the time I got hurt, I was starting to get into a groove, and doing the things I was doing the previous years,'' he said.\n''I felt I benefited from it so much because I had a chance to analyze it being apart from the team - dejected, alone, and said, 'geez, what am I doing this for?' But then I set a goal for myself. I wanted to play before the season was out - and play effectively.'' It has always been an irritant to McNeil that he has never played an entire 16-game season. The one season he did complete he led the league in rushing: the nine-game strike season of 1982. That was followed by two spectacular playoff games - 202 yards against the Cincinnati Bengals and 101 against the Los Angeles Raiders.\nStill, he was generally ineffective in December. McNeil, the player who had been able to generate 19 games of 100 or more yards, could do it only once in 13 December games. Usually, he went into December as a battered player, having invariably been seriously injured at some point in the season - sprained foot his first season of 1981, separated shoulder in 1983, rib injuries in 1984, rib and ankle problems in 1985, and this season's dislocated elbow.\nWas he thinking this time about December? Especially after this season's injury?\n''No. Everything I did in the past didn't make any difference any more,'' he insisted. ''I shed all that, and I thought about how important it was for me to be in the N.F.L. and I could have been out of it. I was getting slapped in the face with reality, and I learned I can change things. It did a lot for me. It let me know that nothing's guaranteed.''\nIn his last three games, though, he is averaging 126 yards a game and 5.3 yards a carry. He is, again, a hot runner.\n''Playing against a guy like that, you're sitting on a keg of dynamite and you hope it doesn't go off while he's in your ball park,'' said the Browns' coach, Marty Schottenheimer.\nSchottenheimer was grading players in 1981 in Cleveland, and Lawrence Taylor, McNeil, Kenny Easley and Ronnie Lott were available that year in the college draft.\n''I studied Freeman McNeil very closely,'' Schottenheimer recalled. ''I had Freeman rated as good as those players.''\nWhen told how Schottenheimer had rated him, McNeil replied, ''Well, I can't let him down.''

468	TUGS OF SUN AND MOON CAUSE TIDAL COMMOTION	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D71439F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The phenomenon that has caused extremely high tides this week involves six factors effecting the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon and the Earth, according to Government specialists.\nThe phenomenon that has caused extremely high tides this week involves six factors effecting the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon and the Earth, according to Government specialists.\nIf all were in complete coincidence, combined with the storms that have battered both coasts, it could have proved disastrous, the specialists said yesterday.\n''That would be a real doozy,'' said Dr. LeRoy E. Doggett of the Nautical Almanac Office of the United States Naval Observatory in Washington.\nThe period of extreme high tides began on Dec. 30 and should begin tapering off today. The Factors at Work\nAccording to Stephen K. Gill of the National Ocean Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the six factors in play are these:\n* The Moon passed almost directly between the Sun and Earth on Dec. 30. In that alignment, syzygy, the gravitational tugs of Sun and Moon work together to cause a ''spring tide.''\n* On that same day the Moon was closest to the Earth in its elliptical monthly orbit around the planet, adding to the moon's gravitational effect.\n* The Earth is nearing its shortest distance from the Sun in the planet's annual journey around that star, augmenting the Sun's gravitational effect. The Earth reaches that point, perihelion, on Jan. 4.\n* On Dec. 30 the Moon reached the southernmost point in its orbit, relative to the Earth's Equator. Therefore the tidal bulge caused by the tug of the Moon in the Earth's water envelope reached its highest latitude in regions below the Moon and on the opposite side of the Earth.\n* Likewise, shortly before midnight, Eastern standard time, on Dec. 21 the Sun reached its southernmost point, the winter solstice, causing a similar tidal effect. In both cases the effect is assymetrical. Were it not for other factors this would cause only a single very high tide, rather than two.\n* Another factor is the current state of an 18.6-year cycle in wobbling of the lunar orbit. In the manner in which the once-popular hula hoops rotated about the hips in a wobbling pattern, the two points at which the lunar orbit crosses the plane of the Earth's Equator rotate in space. The current effect of this process, which astronomers call the regression of the lunar nodes, is to place the Moon exceptionally far south. Lunar and Solar Effects\nThe influence of solar gravity is about half that of the Moon. It is spread over a longer period since the Earth takes a year to circle the Sun. The period of closer proximity to the Sun, centered on Jan. 4, is therefore extended. Lunar effects occur in a monthly cycle and are more transient.\nHigh tides occur simultaneously and symmetrically on opposite sides of the Earth, twice daily at each location. They are high on the side opposite the Moon in part because that side of the Earth is farthest from the Moon and the effect of lunar gravity there is minimal. Lunar gravity also displaces the solid Earth toward the Moon more than it displaces oceans on the far side.

She married him seven years ago and has lived in Moscow on and off since then. She said that she had returned to Spokane so there would be no question about the child's citizenship and that she had not decided whether to return with her baby to the Soviet Union.\n''The child is innocent in all of this,'' she said Thursday after the birth of her daughter, Emily Ann Finkel.\n''She has absolutely nothing to do with any of it,'' she continued. ''The impact of it all may soften hearts a bit.''\nMs. Graham talked to her husband by telephone about a half hour after Emily's birth, and she said he was elated. Husband Felt 'A Bit Left Out'\n''He was with friends and had champagne at the ready,'' she said, adding that he said he felt ''a bit left out.''\n''He is really pleased and thrilled'' she said. ''But it's hard to explain over the phone what she looks like. He was concerned because I had a long labor, and he kept calling for progress reports.''\nSoviet officials have given vague reasons for denying an exit visa to Mr. Finkel, who is 38 years old. Ms. Graham said they had cited concern about information her husband might have obtained while serving his compulsory one-year term in the Soviet Army 15 years ago.\nShe gathered signatures in downtown Spokane three weeks ago as part of a petition to draw attention to her case. The petition was sent to President Reagan, along with a request for him to intercede with the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.\nMs. Graham's parents met with Mr. Reagan while he was in Spokane for a political rally Oct. 31, and the President assured them he would take a personal interest in helping Mr. Finkel.\n''There is no future there for my husband or for us as a family,'' she said. ''It's so unpleasant there, and we'd be better off here - and together, obviously.''\nMs. Graham added, ''For Emily to appear in 1987 is a good sign that this will be the year we'll all be together.''

471	CONGRESS REPORT SEES BUDGET CAP OF $174.5	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D81539F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The Congressional Budget Office said today that the Government would run deficits of $174.5 billion this year and $169.2 billion next year if Congress took no action to change current law.\nThe Congressional Budget Office said today that the Government would run deficits of $174.5 billion this year and $169.2 billion next year if Congress took no action to change current law.\nThe estimates may surprise some members of Congress, who adjourned in October saying they had reduced the deficit for the current fiscal year to $151 billion. That is $7 billion beyond the target for the year sought by the budget-balancing law enacted a year ago.\nRudolph G. Penner, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the new estimates were based on revised economic assumptions and new data on tax collections and Government spending patterns, including the effects of legislation passed in September and October. Reagan Budget More Optimistic\nIn a letter today to the chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees, Mr. Penner also presented his economic forecast, predicting that the economy would expand about 3 percent a year in 1987 and 1988.\nPresident Reagan's budget, to be sent to Congress Monday, makes more optimistic economic assumptions: growth of 3.2 percent this year and 3.7 percent in 1988. Last year at this time the Administration was saying the economy would expand at an annual rate of 4 percent in 1987 and 1988.\nThe Congressional estimate for the deficit this fiscal year is close to the Administration estimate of $173.2 billion. Deficit's Relation to Output\nThe Congressional Budget Office said that under current law the deficit would decline steadily, to $84.8 billion in the fiscal year 1992. It projected deficits of $162.2 billion in 1989, $133.8 billion in 1990 and $109.2 billion in 1991.\nThe office assumes that the economy will continue growing in this period, so it predicts the deficit will shrink from 4 percent of the value of all goods and services the country produces this year to 1.4 percent of this gross national product in 1992 if current law is not changed.\nIn his letter, Mr. Penner said the new estimates of Government spending ''increase the projected deficits substantially'' beyond the levels anticipated just a few months ago. Aid to Banks and Farmers\nOne factor, he said, is that Federal agencies will be providing more aid to troubled financial institutions. Spending for this purpose by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation is estimated to total $6 billion this year, or $4.2 billion more than the budget office assumed in August.\nIn addition, Mr. Penner said the grim outlook for American agricultural exports was expected to ''increase outlays for farm price supports by $3 billion in 1987 and about $6 billion per year in the 1988-1991 period,'' beyond previous estimates.\nSpending on Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor, ''exceeded expectations'' in 1986, and ''this growth is expected to continue,'' he said in the letter. Military Growth Is Outpaced\nAides to Republican members of Congress observed that military spending was growing more slowly than the budget as a whole, according to the new projections.\nThe report by the Congressional Budget Office shows that under current law total spending would grow 6 percent, to $1,069.4 billion in the fiscal year 1988, which starts Oct. 1, while military outlays would grow 3.7 percent, to $289.9 billion.\nBy contrast, according to the report, spending on Government benefit programs would increase 6.4 percent, to $512 billion in 1988 under current law.\nOther nonmilitary spending would increase 11.4 percent, to $185.4 billion in 1988 under current law, the office said. This category of spending includes Federal law enforcement, transportation programs, foreign aid, job training and the work of dozens of other Government agencies from the National Weather Service to the National Park Service.\nThe report indicates that benefit programs are growing faster than the budget office anticipated in August. It now estimates that these programs, which account for nearly half the entire budget, will cost the Government $481 billion this year, or $14 billion more than it projected in August. 'One-Time Savings' Cited\nUnder current law, it said, the Government would spend $617 billion on benefit programs in 1991, or $24 billion more than it projected five months ago.\nJust before Congress adjourned in October, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and other Republicans said it appeared that the 1987 deficit would be $151 billion. But the ranking Democrat on the panel, Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida, said then that the deficit would be substantially higher ''when you strip out the smoke and mirrors.''\nThe Congressional Budget Office said today that legislation approved in the final months of the last Congress would reduce the deficit by $32 billion in the current fiscal year. However, it said most of these changes produced ''one-time savings'' and would reduce the deficit by only $6 billion a year in the future.\nMr. Reagan's budget will show a deficit of $107.8 billion for 1988. If Congress made no changes in existing law, the 1988 deficit would be $150 billion, according to Administration estimates shown in confidential budget documents. This is $19 billion less than the deficit projected by the Congressional Budget Office. Differing Economic Assumptions\nEdwin L. Dale Jr., spokesman for the Administration's Office of Management and Budget, said the difference was ''almost entirely accounted for'' by different assumptions about the performance of the economy and the timing of Federal payments to farmers.\nThe Administration assumes lower interest rates than the Congressional Budget Office for this year and the next five years. For 1987, the Congressional office envisions rates of 5.6 percent on three-month Treasury bills and 7.2 percent on 10-year Government bonds. By contrast, the Administration assumes those rates will be 5.4 percent and 6.7 percent.

Mr. Marvin said he learned of Mr. Halcomb's case ''purely by accident'' from another prisoner.\n''He could have been in there forever,'' Mr. Marvin said.\n''There are safeguards and procedures built into the system to prevent this kind of thing from happening,'' he said. ''In this case, they were totally ignored.'' Mother Feared Her Son\nJudge Meyerson said he ordered Mr. Halcomb jailed because the defendant's mother, Ethel Halcomb, said she and her family feared the 290-pound man when he was drunk. She also said alcoholism counselors had recommended confinement.\nMr. Halcomb was never represented by a lawyer. In addition, he was not provided with a sign language interpreter when he pleaded not guilty to a charge of disorderly intoxication July 7.\n''Everybody should be represented by an attorney,'' Judge Meyerson said. ''In this particular case, his mother, who he lived with, was with him.''\nThe case began May 10 when the manager of a doughnut shop complained of an unruly customer. Mr. Halcomb was charged with disorderly intoxication, a charge that carries a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail.\nJudge Meyerson ordered him to participate in an alcohol and drug abuse program, but his mother said he quit after a couple of sessions.\nOn Sept. 5, Edward Cooke, supervisor of Dade County's alcohol and drug abuse program, asked Judge Meyerson to sentence Mr. Halcomb to treatment.\nThe judge sent Mr. Halcomb to jail Nov. 13, saying that the indefinite sentence was treatment rather than punishment.\nWhen an administrative judge signed the release, he ordered Mr. Halcomb to appear before Judge Meyerson next week. A lawyer will accompany him.
476	SIHANOUK'S SON JOINS FATHER'S FIGHT	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DB1239F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Eight years ago this month, when the Vietnamese Army marched into Phnom Penh and overthrew Pol Pot, Prince Norodom Ranariddh was living the untroubled life of a university lecturer in France.\nEight years ago this month, when the Vietnamese Army marched into Phnom Penh and overthrew Pol Pot, Prince Norodom Ranariddh was living the untroubled life of a university lecturer in France.\nHe thought the turbulent years of his Cambodian youth were behind him. His father, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, had been in and out of power - first as King, later as leader of a Government overthrown by Washington-backed officers, and finally as Pol Pot's head of a Khmer Rouge state, brought back to give the regime respectability.\n''I was not so rich in France,'' he said of life in exile. ''But I was very free.''\nAs the anniversary Jan. 7 of Vietnamese occupation nears, Prince Ranariddh, 43 years old, is back in Southeast Asia, deeply enmeshed in the torment of what he calls ''my poor country.'' He is commander of a growing army of guerrillas, one of three forces allied against the regime in Phnom Penh, as well as the alliance's diplomatic strategist. He is also becoming in some Cambodian eyes an heir to the powerful symbolic role of his father.\nPrince Ranariddh, in an interview on New Year's Eve in his Bangkok home, said he did not seek a royal role. But in the minds of exiles, he said, Prince Sihanouk is certainly identified with a period of ''real independence for our country, and also peace, liberty and development - a very beautiful time.'' A Learning Experience\nPrince Ranariddh said that in the last three years of shuttling back and forth between the Cambodian border and Beijing, where his father is based, he had come to know the Cambodian people for the first time.\n''I was the son of a King,'' he said. ''I lived in the palace, and I spent a lot of time - maybe more than 10 years - abroad, especially in France. And so I did not know the Khmer people, the Khmer mentality, the Khmer feeling.''\n''Thanks to my father, I have had the great joy to discover my people,'' said the Prince, a scholar of international law with a Ph.D. from the University of Aix-en-Provence, where he later taught.\nThe Prince said he is worried that the Soviet Union, which supports Vietnam, and China, which backs the Cambodian insurgents, might strike a deal on Cambodia, to the country's detriment.\n''I cannot believe that China and the Soviet Union, the two Communist superpowers, could allow Cambodia to adopt a liberal ideology,'' he said.\n''In Washington at the State Department recently they told me: 'Don't worry about that, because the hostility between the Soviet Union and China is so deep that there is no chance they will reach an agreement on Cambodia,' '' he said. ''The Americans are really very naive.'' The Popularity Contest\nThe Prince said a Chinese journalist recently asked him for proof that his father was still popular in his homeland.\n''I said the proof is that the Chinese Government had printed a hundred thousand portraits of Prince Sihanouk and sent them to the Khmer Rouge to take inside Cambodia,'' he said.\n''Could they bring to our people the portrait of Mr. Pol Pot?'' he asked. ''Could they play on the radio the voice of Mr. Khieu Samphan?''\nKhieu Samphan represents the Khmer Rouge in the coalition, which also includes the Sihanoukists and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front. Pol Pot, who led the Khmer Rouge Government that left hundreds of thousands dead from 1975 to 1978, is said to have retired; there are reports that he is gravely ill.\nThe Prince said he doubted that anything in the Khmer Rouge's radical ideology had changed, despite highly publicized commitments to more centrist policies. Rivalry Within Alliance\nThe Khmer Rouge remains the strongest member of the coalition. Prince Ranariddh said it was imperative that his army equalize resources with the more powerful and numerous Khmer Rouge, so that Cambodians who do not want the Vietnamese will cease to fear a return of the Khmer Rouge.\nThe National Liberation Front, wracked by internal bickering, is the smallest of the three groups. Prince Ranariddh dismissed it, along with many members of the exiled Cambodian middle class who, he said, ''struggle from the coffeehouses of Paris and New York.''\nThe Prince talked about his ''Solarz projects'' - paid for with about $4 million in United States aid for which Representative Steven J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads the House subcommittee on East Asia, was a key Congressional sponsor.\nThe Prince said the money had bought medicine, clothes and radios. He said more money would allow the Voice of the Khmers, a 10-kilowatt radio station, to be upgraded to reach all of Cambodia.\nHe said there could be no military victory against the Vietnamese. His only hope, he said, was to ''mobilize the people'' into noncooperation and sabotage. He said more money was needed to ''win hearts'' by sending medical teams into the Cambodian countryside and outbidding the Vietnamese for Cambodian farmers' rice. Erosion of Culture\nPrince Ranariddh reserves his most eloquent anguish for the erosion of Khmer culture.\n''A lot of people talk just about the war in Cambodia,'' he said. ''But there is another process: the Vietnamization of Cambodia.''\n''There are 700,000 Vietnamese civilians in Cambodia, and they are exploiting our soil,'' he said. ''Even in the very small villages, there are already Vietnamese merchants. They buy rice from our people at very low prices and send it on trucks back to Vietnam.''\n''The Vietnamese have rewritten our bilateral history,'' he went on, adding that in almost every area of culture subtle changes were taking place ''that the foreigner does not see.'' On a note pad, he sketched the evolution of classical dance students' costumes from a traditional Khmer to a Vietnamese style.\n''The Vietnamese have tried to Vietnamize us many times in history,'' the Prince said. ''But this time is more dangerous.''\n''They are supported by the very powerful Soviet Union,'' he said. ''They also have an ideology, the Communist ideology, that is very powerful. France colonized us just economically. But now the colonization is political, physical.''\n''Maybe,'' he said ''and I hope not - this is the beginning of the end of the ethnic Khmer nation.''

'A Pretty Good Job'\nThe agency assembled planners in marketing and rail service who developed a master plan for what became the Consolidated Rail Corporation, more commonly known as Conrail. It went on to monitor Conrail's long and troubled road to profitability, making recommendations for adjustments in Federal policy along the way to help the carrier. The agency also hired a battery of lawyers to handle lawsuits on claims.\nToday railroad service in the regions is healthier than it has been in decades, and now the U.S.R.A. is working on its final assignment: shutting down. Some people are a bit nostalgic about it while others are somewhat elated.\nWhatever the case, the railway agency is, ultimately, that rarest of Washington rarities - a bureaucracy that is going out of business instead of growing like a summer weed.\n''The historical record is that they did a pretty good job,'' said Deputy Transportation Secretary James H. Burnley 4th, who often found himself at odds with the agency in recent years as it warned Congress not to go along with the Transportation Department's plan to sell Conrail to a private buyer.\n''During their early years they played a valuable role,'' Mr. Burnley said. ''But in the last three years, it's been sort of an agency with no mission. It just sat on the sidelines and carped.''\nCongressional approval last fall of the sale of the Government's 85 percent interest in Conrail eliminated the need for the agency to exist. It will be closed April 1.\n''No one expected us to be in business this long,'' said Cary Dickieson, one of the agency's original staff members, who also served as its executive vice president for six years. ''When it was first set up, people thought it would be in business for about three years.''\nBut, as Mr. Dickieson and others noted, that forecast would prove incorrect.\nJust settling the nearly $17 billion in claims against the seven bankrupt railroads took the better part of nine years.\nAt the height of the litigation, when the railway agency had a staff of 400 employees and a budget of $30 million, nearly two-thirds of those employees were lawyers working on claims.\nMeanwhile, turning a handful of failed railroads into a single profitable line took almost as long as settling the lawsuits.\nThe agency's initial goal of achieving a profitable operation in just a few years fell short because of declining rail traffic in the regions and an economic slide that dominated the economy in most of the late 1970's and into the early 1980's.\nThe turnaround did not come before the railway agency and the Reagan Administration squared off over Conrail's future, a battle that has since kept the two at odds.\nWhen President Reagan took office, his Administration proposed dismantling Conrail and selling its pieces so as to end a mounting Federal subsidy. But the railway agency persuaded Congress in 1981 to adopt legislation aimed at giving Conrail one last chance to succeed. $1 Billion in the Bank The legislation made it easier for Conrail to abandon trackage, dismiss workers and cut costs in other ways. That same year, L. Stanley Crane, former chief executive of the Southern Railway System, became chief executive of Conrail.\nToday, Conrail is one of the most profitable railroads in the country, with about $1 billion in profits in the bank, and it will be sold in a public stock offering as one company rather than in pieces. The low-profile railway agency has been given a lot of the credit in this effort.\n''They did their job very well,'' said Representative James J. Florio, the New Jersey Democrat who played a key role on railroad issues as chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Transportation and Tourism of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n''They were the objective information generators for Congress,'' Mr. Florio said, adding that the agency was not liked by the Reagan Administration ''because U.S.R.A. was committed to a viable Conrail.''

Zimroth, then chief assistant to the Manhattan District Attorney, was considering two job offers, one to join a small Wall Street law firm and the other to become Mayor Koch's criminal-justice coordinator.\nEarly in 1980, Peter L. Zimroth, then chief assistant to the Manhattan District Attorney, was considering two job offers, one to join a small Wall Street law firm and the other to become Mayor Koch's criminal-justice coordinator.\nMr. Zimroth turned down the Mayor's offer.\nInstead, he entered private practice, after 14 years as a prosecutor and law professor, ''to get more breadth as a lawyer,'' Mr. Zimroth recalled yesterday after Mr. Koch named him the city's new Corporation Counsel.\nDespite that concern of seven years ago, Mr. Zimroth's resume and interviews with his friends suggest that diversity has long been one of his greatest assets.\n''I think I'm a very good lawyer, I do,'' Mr. Zimroth said in an interview after a brief news conference in the Mayor's City Hall office. ''And I've had a very broad experience in the law.\n''I've been a prosecutor, a defense lawyer, a teacher. I've been an administrator. And I really feel very strongly about using the law as an instrument for social good. That's why I became a lawyer.'' In Past, a Top Advisory Post\nThe Mayor's two previous Corporation Counsels - Allen G. Schwartz and Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., who officially left the post Thursday after five years to return to private practice - each became a close adviser to Mr. Koch on matters of general policy as well as of law. Mr. Koch said yesterday that he hoped Mr. Zimroth would ''occupy the same role that they occupied.''\nMr. Zimroth, a 43-year-old native of Brooklyn, was offered the job Monday and accepted it Tuesday. He said he had not yet formulated specific ideas or themes that he might emphasize as the city's top lawyer and head of an office of 500 lawyers. In addition to defending the city, he said, he hoped ''to use the law in an imaginative way.''\nMr. Zimroth also said that he thought the city corruption scandal was ''more a challenge than a liability'' to someone entering the administration, because it provided an opportunity to work toward fundamental changes in government and politics.\nFriends said Mr. Zimroth's tenure as the top assistant to District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan from 1977 to 1980 would serve him well in his new job. 'Experience in Public Issues'\n''He's had a lot of experience in the kinds of public issues that the Mayor's lawyer needs to consider,'' said Judge Pierre N. Leval of Federal District Court in Manhattan, an old friend and colleague.\nBorn Jan. 11, 1943, Peter Lenard Zimroth was raised in the Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay sections. His father, Sol, owned a dry-cleaning store in Brooklyn, and later sold insurance and mutual funds. His mother, Ruth, was a homemaker during his youth and later worked as a bookkeeper. His parents now live in Connecticut, as does his sister, Alice.\nMr. Zimroth graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, Columbia College and Yale Law School. He was editor in chief of The Yale Law Journal. He was a law clerk to Chief Judge David L. Bazelon of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, then to Justice Abe Fortas of the Supreme Court of the United States.\nMr. Zimroth worked as an assistant United States Attorney in Manhattan for several years before joining the law school faculty at New York University in 1970. He taught courses on the Federal courts, criminal law and criminal procedure and attained the rank of professor. A Reunion With Morgenthau\nIn 1974, he published a book, ''Perversions of Justice,'' about political trials in the United States during the late 1960's and early 1970's.\nIn 1975, he rejoined Mr. Morgenthau - under whom he had worked in the United States Attorney's office in the late 1960's - in the District Attorney's office.\nSince entering private practice in 1980, he has specialized in criminal and civil litigation. Mr. Zimroth described the practice as ''a broadening experience.''\n''The demands of the courts and clients are really different from those in public life,'' he said. ''Every case that you have, you have to learn a new thing, a new business, a new industry.''\nRobert S. Fink, a partner with Mr. Zimroth in the firm of Kostelanetz & Ritholz, described the new Corporation Counsel as ''a perfectionist.'' Knows How to Relax\n''He is an extremely hard worker; he's a workaholic,'' Mr. Fink said. ''He is, I think, a very, very brilliant lawyer. And he is probably the best trainer of young lawyers in our firm.''\nWhile Mr. Zimroth will work through the night when necessary, Mr. Fink said, he also knows how to relax. It was during such a moment that Mr. Zimroth met his wife, the actress Estelle Parsons, 14 years ago.\nShe was filming a movie, ''Four Play,'' at a bar in SoHo and Mr. Zimroth, who accompanied a mutual friend to the set, got a role as an extra. ''And he had those beautiful blue eyes,'' Ms. Parsons said.\nThe couple lived in the same building on Manhattan's Upper West Side but had never met. Married four years, they are still there, with their son, Abraham, who is 3.\nMr. Zimroth, who will earn $94,500 a year, said he had taken a ''very substantial'' cut in pay to return to government. Asked how long he expected to remain Corporation Counsel, he answered, ''As long as I can afford it.'' MAN IN THE NEWS
480	O'CONNOR TOURS THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D81339F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Israelis showed John Cardinal O'Connor the grim pictorial record of the Holocaust today, taking him on a tour of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum.\nIsraelis showed John Cardinal O'Connor the grim pictorial record of the Holocaust today, taking him on a tour of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum.\nThe Israelis were openly hoping the Cardinal would understand the relationship between those horrors and the need for a secure Israel not dependent on the good will of other nations.\nIn remarks to reporters later, the Cardinal suggested that his tour of Yad Vashem had not changed his views on Vatican recognition of Israel.\n''I think it's totally irrelevant,'' he said. ''We're talking about an event infinitely beyond such matters. I could talk glibly, and I could use all sorts of political jargon. But this is the mystery of suffering, and we must do what we can to preclude this kind of suffering to the degree possible. Whether that can be brought about by any kind of diplomatic relations, I don't know.'' Views Photos and Documents\nAt Yad Vashem, Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, saw photographs of rabbis humiliated by Nazi soldiers, of children starving in the Warsaw ghetto, of women stripped to be marched off and shot, of emaciated death camp inmates lying side by side in wooden bunks, of pits filled with piles of corpses. He viewed pictures and documents that told how ships filled with Jews trying to flee such atrocities were turned back by country after country.\n''If at that time there had been a Jewish state, things would have been different,'' said his guide, Yitzhak Arad, the chairman of Yad Vashem.\nThe Cardinal walked through the museum silently, nodding his head in disbelief, the pain of what he saw visible in his face.\nLater, he prayed for five minutes in a memorial hall to the six million Jewish victims of the Nazis, kneeling in front of an eternal flame surrounded by the block-lettered names of the major Nazi extermination camps. Called 'Totally Indescribable'\nHe emerged into a fog-shrouded morning and was asked by reporters to describe his feelings.\n''Anything I would say here is banal,'' he said. ''This is totally indescribable. I can't talk about it. It's a mystery to me.''\nThe Cardinal was invited to Israel in September after he made a public appeal for a Palestinian homeland. Israeli leaders hoped that by understanding the history of anti-Jewish persecution and Israel's vulnerability in the Arab world, he would appreciate why Israel finds it difficult to make such concessions to the Palestinians as the surrender of the West Bank.\nThe Israelis would also like the Cardinal to understand the injury they feel at the Vatican's refusal to extend full diplomatic relations to Israel and to recognize its control over an undivided Jerusalem. The Vatican would prefer international status for Jerusalem.\nThe injury to Israel was amplified in the last week when the Cardinal first scheduled and then canceled meetings with top Israeli leaders, explaining that the Vatican's policy on Jerusalem forbade him to meet officially with the leaders in Jerusalem. The Cardinal, at a New Year's Day mass in the Old City of Jerusalem, apologized to the Israeli people and Government for the gaffe. Explaining Israel's Fears\nAs the Cardinal stepped into his car, Mr. Arad told him, ''It's impossible to understand Israel's fears and its courage without seeing the background of the Holocaust.''\nLater, Mr. Arad, whose parents perished in the Treblinka death camp, said to reporters:\n''The lesson we have learned of the Holocaust is what it means to be on the margins of mankind, to be vulnerable, to be dependent on the good will of other people. If someone says to us that they want to push us into the sea, we have to take that seriously.''\nMr. Arad was referring to threatening statements made over the years by some Palestinian leaders and others.\nThe Cardinal said he ''would never dream of contradicting'' Israel's right to exist. Indeed, he said, ''it is my conviction and the conviction of my Pope that Israel has the right to self-determination, the right to defend its borders, the right to want to struggle for freedom.'' Won't Talk About Diplomacy\nIt is an arguable matter, he said, whether Vatican diplomatic recognition would ''preclude such suffering'' as the Holocaust. ''I'm not a high-flown diplomat,'' he said. ''I can't talk intelligently about diplomatic relations.''\nBut the reality of the Holocaust, he said, ''has chilled me ever since the first day I put my hand into the ovens at Dachau'' during a visit to West Germany. The Holocaust, he said, has deepened his ''commitment to the sacredness of every human person.''\n''This is why I speak out so passionately about the unborn, because I think they're human, about the crippled and diseased, about Jews and Arabs,'' he said. ''If the Nazis had really believed that, do you think the Holocaust would have happened?''\nAt Yad Vashem, the Cardinal was shown the tree-lined Avenue of the Righteous dedicated to 5,000 non-Jews, some of them Roman Catholic priests, who helped conceal Jews or otherwise rescued them from the Nazis. But reporters also asked him about criticism that the Vatican had failed at the time to speak out about the brutalities against Jews.\n''I don't know what the church did or did not do,'' the Cardinal said. ''We now know it's my responsibility to prevent this kind of suffering for Jews and for all people.'' Church Silence Faulted\nAfter the Cardinal left, Mr. Arad took a different view.\n''All of us know about the silence of the church at that time,'' he said. ''If the church had raised its voice, many more Jews would have survived. It would have caused more Christians to help Jews, and Jewish survival often depended on the local population.''\nLater in the morning, the Cardinal, 66 years old, met for an hour and a half with Zevulon Hammer, the Minister of Religious Affairs. The Cardinal had concluded that Mr. Hammer was the highest-ranking Israeli that he was permitted to meet officially in Jerusalem under Vatican guidelines.\nMr. Hammer said afterward that the Cardinal had spoken to him about the possibility of arranging some informal meetings outside of the official buildings of Jerusalem with President Chaim Herzog and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.\nMr. Hammer, however, suggested that such meetings would be difficult because Israel did not want to set precedents that would later allow foreign officials and diplomatic representatives to ''boycott Jerusalem.''\nAs he left the meeting with Mr. Hammer, Cardinal O'Connor was asked why he felt Vatican guidelines permitted him to meet with Mr. Hammer but not with other Israeli officials. He replied, ''There are no implications in my coming here, because religion is sacred and common to both of us.'' Won't Meet With Peres\nFor the first time, the Cardinal said definitively that according to his reading of Vatican guidelines, he would not be able to meet with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres in his Jerusalem office. It was Mr. Peres, while in New York last September, who originally invited the Cardinal to come to Israel, and the Cardinal had earlier indicated that a return courtesy call to Mr. Peres might not violate Vatican protocol.\nThe Cardinal met earlier this week with King Hussein of Jordan, whose country the Vatican also does not recognize diplomatically. He explained that he could meet the King but not the Prime Minister or President of Israel because diplomatic recognition was not at issue. Only the status of Jerusalem is at issue, he said.\nThe Cardinal said he had also discussed his visit to Yad Vashem with Mr. Hammer. ''I mentioned to the Minister,'' he said, ''that it might well be that the Holocaust may be an enormous gift that Judaism has given to the world.''\nThe suffering, the Cardinal explained, taught the world of the ''sacredness and dignity of every human person.''

It is available for $12.95 from Barclay Bridge Supplies, 8 Bush Avenue, Box 909, Port Chester N.Y. 10573.\nThe author offers a hilarious revision of the Greek myths, explaining what Homer and Virgil omitted: that bridge games played a vital role in the story of Helen, Paris, Achilles, Hector, Odysseus and the rest. The punny presentation (''all leads roam to Rhodes'') allows the reader to learn, or relearn, the classical legends in painless fashion.

But we can reveal that he found a brilliant solution while substantially inebriated: ruff five hearts in the closed hand, so that the 8-7 of trumps in the dummy scores a trick at the finish.

In Kwanobuhle township, near Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape, another black man was found with burns to the head and upper body but still alive. Burnings Are Favored\nBurning has become a favored form of execution by black militants against those they deem to be collaborators with white authority.\nThe violence erupted despite a state of emergency in force since June 12 that was designed to curb unrest in part by giving the security forces wide powers. It is estimated that 22,000 people have been detained for varying periods without charge or trial.\nSince September 1984, more than 2,300 people have been killed in protest and violence, hundreds of them in what the authorities once called black-on-black violence.\nSince last month, when the nation's emergency regulations were tightened to include strict censorship and the banning of residual forms of black protest, the Bureau for Information has cast such violence in more ideological terms, calling the perpetrators ''black radicals.''\nThe bureau said that shortly after midnight on New Year's Day, ''black radicals'' opened fire on a young white soldier in Alexandra township, a tangled warren of slums and homes situated near Johannesburg's wealthiest suburbs. The soldier, who was not identified, was said to have been seriously wounded.\nAlexandra is one of the most defiant of South Africa's black townships. Last February more than 20 people died in riots and fighting there.\nEditor's Note:\nSouth African press restrictions now prohibit journalists from transmitting dispatches on any security actions, protests, detentions or ''subversive statements'' without clearance by Government censors.
490	CONNER BOAT GAINS CHALLENGER FINALS	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED91E39F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Tom Blackaller bowed out of the America's Cup competition today, confident that his longtime rival, Dennis Conner, would go on to beat New Zealand in the challenger finals.\nTom Blackaller bowed out of the America's Cup competition today, confident that his longtime rival, Dennis Conner, would go on to beat New Zealand in the challenger finals.\nBlackaller's USA lost the day's race to Conner's Stars & Stripes by 43 seconds. And when Chris Dickson's New Zealand defeated Marc Pajot's French Kiss by 2 minutes 44 seconds, it meant that both Stars & Stripes and New Zealand had completed four-race sweeps in the challenger semifinals.\nThey will begin competing against each other Jan. 13 in a four-of-seven-race final round whose winner will challenge for the cup the Australians won in 1983.\n''I have a lot better feel for how fast Stars & Stripes is and of the improvements they have made, at least relative to us,'' Blackaller said after today's defeat. ''I think Stars & Stripes is going to represent the United States very well in the trials, and I'd be surprised if Stars & Stripes doesn't become challenger.'' Had Been Bitter Rivals\nThe comment was unexpected, considering the past rancor between the West Coast skippers - Conner, from San Diego, and Blackaller, from San Francisco. But Blackaller seemed able to put that behind him today. He offered Conner the use of any equipment that might be useful in his races against New Zealand.\nConner had made structural changes to Stars & Stripes for the semifinals, and USA was the first boat to feel the new power. Blackaller conceded that USA was slower, although not far off the pace.\n''I think that what we did was a creditable effort - not good enough obviously - but I don't feel let down at all,'' said Blackaller. ''I think that we took the strongest technology swipe at this thing that anybody took, and I'm very proud of that effort.''\nBlackaller faulted his team for starting too late - at least a year behind most other syndicates. That, coupled with a budget that was half of Conner's $15 million effort, put him at a disadvantage. French Boat Lacked Speed\nThe French, who decided on a winged keel approach, failed for different reasons. They came here last October with a boat they trusted. But when it came down to a one-on-one sparring with New Zealand, the boat wasn't fast enough, even with changes.\nDickson, whose won-lost record of 37-1 outweighs Conner's 31-7 in three months of trial racing, seemed unconcerned today about a potential threat from Stars & Stripes. His boat, also known as Kiwi Magic, has beaten boats in every wind condition, whereas Stars & Stripes tends to lose races in winds under 16 knots.\n''All we have to go on is the three races we have had to date with Stars & Stripes,'' Dickson said, noting that the Conner boat was the only one to beat him. ''They're certainly different to what they were, and we're certainly a different boat as well.''\nConner appeared at a post-race news conference and said: ''We haven't sailed long enough in these conditions to know who will come out ahead. But I think we're both reaching the top of our game at the right time.''\nStars & Stripes led USA round the 24-mile race course today, except for one brief interlude when USA moved two boat lengths ahead. The seas were choppy, with a 16-knot sea breeze at the start blossoming into 24 knots two-thirds into the race.\nBlackaller's boat caught a fresher breeze on the right side of the course, along with a stretch of calmer water. But his gain didn't last long. Conner moved in from the left, dipping his boat under USA's stern with so much way that Blackaller had little choice but to tack for clear air. KOOKABURRA III RALLIES TO WIN\nThere was high drama in the defenders' races today as well. Kookaburra III came from behind in the last leg of her race with Australia IV to win by 17 seconds. A fitting at the head of the mainsail ripped loose on Australia IV in the final minutes.\nIn a race with Kookaburra II, the mainsail of the 12-Meter Steak 'n Kidney was ripped open. Steak 'n Kidney, a Sydney boat, had to finish under a headsail alone and lost the race by two minutes. Tied for first place in the defenders' round-robin, with 65 points each, are Australia IV and Kookaburra III.\nAMERICA'S CUP
491	LOTS TO PROVE FOR JETS, BROWNS	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D81E39F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In so many ways, today's American Conference divisional clash is more than a big playoff game for the Jets and the Browns.\nIn so many ways, today's American Conference divisional clash is more than a big playoff game for the Jets and the Browns.\nThe Jets see it as a chance for vindication, a stamp of approval that this season was not wasted.\n''We beat Kansas City, and people say we beat the team with the 28th-worst offense,'' said Barry Bennett, the defensive tackle. ''What will they say when we beat Cleveland?''\nBut this game - with the winner facing either Denver or New England for the American Conference championship and a berth in the Super Bowl - is not a war of words. It is a game for the field.\nIf the Jets are attempting to prove that their 10-1 start was genuine -and overshadow the five-game losing streak that ended their regular season - the Browns are attempting to enter the National Football League's upper echelon. Playoff Losing Streak\nTheir 12-4 mark was the conference's best. But they have not won a playoff game since 1969, losing five. Last year, as the Central Division winner with a laugh-provoking 8-8 mark, they were knocked out in the conference semifinals by the Miami Dolphins. The A.F.C.'s Central Division champion has been defeated after one playoff game each of the last three years.\nBut while the Jets were dropping their final five games this season, the Browns were winning their last five, including a pair in overtime. Little wonder that the Browns are favored by as many as 7 points.\nOn the field it may not be so easy for the Browns. There could be a standoff between the teams in what are likely to be the game's two key elements: the Browns' passing and the Jets' rushing.\nOffensively, the Jets have been clicking with a running game, and the Browns are vulnerable there.\nCleveland's defense against the run is mediocre, allowing opponents 4 yards a carry with a ranking of 18th in the league.\nIn their losses, the Browns yielded 193 rushing yards to the Chicago Bears, 257 to the Cincinnati Bengals, 96 to the weak Green Bay Packers and 121 to the Los Angeles Raiders. The running game is a part of the Jets' offense that is surging. And in the playoffs, what is working now is all that matters. Element of Surprise\nIt is the kind of offense that Pat Ryan can lead so well. Yet, it is apparent that Coach Joe Walton knows exactly what the Browns are thinking: stop Freeman McNeil. So Walton is likely to attempt some surprises with Ryan, whose reputation does not include the big-passing game. With a Cleveland defense not expecting it, though, there could be some surprises. Certainly, with Wesley Walker and Al Toon, the big-play threat is there.\nAnd just as McNeil has become a hot runner, Ryan is a hot quarterback following a confident, mistake-free victory over Kansas City in the wild-card playoff last Sunday.\nThe big tackler on the Browns is their left ouside linebacker, Chip Banks, who also is a feared pass-rusher. His presence makes the blocking of Tony Paige, the Jets' fullback, extremely important for deeper passing.\nAlso, the blocking of Gordon King, the right tackle, takes on a significant dimension in the face of Banks's rush. King also will be tied up with Reggie Camp, the left end, while Carl Hairston, right end and the Browns' leader in sacks with nine, will be matched against Jim Sweeney, the Jets' left tackle.\nThe Jet defense may experience the frenzy that can affect teams that face an offense directed by Lindy Infante. He once was the Bengals' offensive coordinator, putting in what seemed like miles of pass routes run by Ken Anderson's receivers.\nWith the Browns, he has done much the same. Bernie Kosar, the quarterback, directed an attack in which 7 receivers each snared at least 28 passes. Brian Brennan, once Doug Flutie's favorite receiver at Boston College, was the team leader with 55 receptions. A Jet Weakness\nOf course, the pass is the bete noire of the Jet defense. Opposing passers completed almost 58 percent of their attempts, averaged more than 7.5 yards a throw, and tossed 35 touchdown passes.\nIn Kosar, the Jets will face a quarterback who led all passers with the fewest interceptions and who makes quick, intelligent decisions. The Jets' line must pressure him, or else the Jets' secondary will have to pressure his receivers to take them out of their routes.\nRussell Carter will be defending the Jets' right corner. ''A lot of guys spread the ball around a lot,'' Carter said, ''but Kosar is very decisive where he's going. You don't have much time. He's getting rid of every mistake on your part.'' The antidote? ''The coverage will have to be a little tighter, and get the receivers off their timing,'' Carter said.\nThat can be done with an aggressive bump-and-run. It is unlikely to be accomplished by shooting defensive backs or linebackers toward Kosar. With his quick reads, he will spot an uncovered receiver. It means that the Jets' defensive line, which has no one with more than three sacks, will be alone in applying pressure against a quarterback sacked only seven times in the last five games. O'BRIEN READY\nWalton said he would not hesitate to bring in Ken O'Brien for any reason. ''They've both worked fine,'' Walton said. ''Kenny's knuckle would bother him the rest of the season, but it's a little better.'' O'Brien hurt his pinkie three games ago. Ryan hurt his upper arm against the Chiefs. . . . In the Jets' playoff history, they have won two of their four games on the road. . . . Johnny Hector is unlikely to play, Walton said. That would again leave virtually all the running to McNeil.
492	Rangers Welcome Carpenter	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D81E39F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: He was ushered past television crews and reporters, he shook hands with a few people he did not know, and finally he landed at the entrance to Phil Esposito's office. Esposito, in his stocking feet, came to the door, took one look at Bobby Carpenter, threw up his hands, and said, ''Hallelujah.''\nHe was ushered past television crews and reporters, he shook hands with a few people he did not know, and finally he landed at the entrance to Phil Esposito's office. Esposito, in his stocking feet, came to the door, took one look at Bobby Carpenter, threw up his hands, and said, ''Hallelujah.''\nCarpenter arrived at the Rangers' training camp this afternoon and -this is not a passing item - was welcomed. He was too late to meet his new teammates, but he heard more glad-to-have-you's than he had in some time. After six weeks in an exiled state with the Washington Capitals, he had a twofold reaction to the reception, first saying he was ''really happy to get to a team where I want to play.'' Then he fired off some searing remarks about his old team and, in particular, his former coach, Bryan Murray.\n''I'm the lucky one to get out of there,'' he said. ''Lots of players said, 'Take me with you.' They're fed up with his attitude and the way he's coaching. He played head games with you and he panicked on the bench, yelling. Players reacted to that. It's a mess. The whole management down there is a mess.''\nReached by telephone tonight, Murray said he was reluctant to engage in a public squabble. ''I don't have to be in a position to defend myself,'' he said. ''I'll say this, he's putting pressure on himself with these comments.'' Out of Action Since Nov. 22\nThus, Carpenter's silence on the most peculiar period in his life officially ended. He was the Capitals' first choice in the 1981 entry draft and he never played a day in the minor leagues, but he last played hockey on Nov. 22 and then things turned sour. Three days later, the Capitals' general manager, David Poile, called him to his office and said he need not practice with the club any longer, that he should go home and await a trade later in the day.\nHe waited and he waited and while Poile and Murray said he had a poor attitude and painted him as a prima donna they could no longer control, Carpenter said nothing. He waited until New Year's Day, when he found out he had been sent to the Rangers for Mike Ridley, Kelly Miller, and Bobby Crawford. The Rangers also received Washington's second-round draft selection for 1989.\nCarpenter, 23 years old, a 53-goal scorer just two seasons back, said he was genuinely thrilled to be with the Rangers. Two years ago, when he was a free agent, he came closer to coming to the Rangers, he said, but Craig Patrick, then the general manager, thought the compensation price too high. After all the talks between Poile and Esposito over the last month and a half Carpenter will make his debut with the Rangers Saturday night in Quebec as a center -the Capitals had been using him at left wing - on a line with Mark Osborne and Pierre Larouche, another former 50-goal scorer.\nIf he is not yet game-ready, Esposito said he would spot him into the lineup on face-offs. Carpenter will wear No. 11, a change from No. 10, which belongs to Larouche. Capitals Needed a Forward\nIn actuality, Poile had been talking with several clubs about moving the player. But a few circumstances brought him and Esposito rushing together on Thursday morning. First, key injuries had given the Capitals, who are in last place in the Patrick Division, an urgent need at the forward position. Esposito had forwards to give up, and Esposito had reportedly heard that the Devils were close to acquiring Carpenter.\nIn any case, in the last several days Esposito had become convinced that Carpenter was one of the key pieces the Rangers needed to become a quality team. He said today that with him, he thought there was a possibility the team could finish second or third. ''More realistically,'' he added, ''third or fourth.''\nAnytime a team gives up three players for one, especially if the one has a sullied reputation, it is a gamble. But quality players are usually obtained only when they are leaving clouded situations. Esposito had this one opportunity and he grabbed it.\nCarpenter started his day at 5 A.M. He missed the 7 o'clock shuttle for New York because of a road accident that slowed traffic. He spent most of the morning undergoing physical examinations at Lenox Hill Hospital along with Coach Tom Webster, who visited with his doctors. Webster Recovering\nWebster was told he was recovering well from surgery for an inner-ear infection. He will return behind the bench Monday night at Madison Square Garden, but because he is not yet permitted to fly, Webster will not coach the team against the Nordiques Saturday night. Carpenter, who had played in 422 consecutive games before his benching, was issued a clean bill.\nHe said his problems were probably precipitated when Murray first took over. ''He told me I didn't come into the league the right way,'' said Carpenter. He said, 'I'll teach you.' ''\nHe said the decision to remain silent while the Capitals' management talked was calculated.\n''They put themselves in a bind,'' he said. ''They look like fools and we sat back and didn't say anything. They were losing and I was happy to be their scapegoat. They're playing worse now.''\nRod Langway, the Capitals' captain, had this response to Carpenter's remarks: ''Bobby has to look at himself in the mirror. If you feel that way in your heart, obviously it's going to affect your play, but I didn't hear a lot of complaints from him when he was scoring 53 goals.''

Amato, is trying to block payment of about $500,000 in bonuses to outgoing aides of his predecessor, Peter Shapiro.\nEssex County's new chief executive, Nicholas R. Amato, is trying to block payment of about $500,000 in bonuses to outgoing aides of his predecessor, Peter Shapiro.\nThe payments, which amount to about 80 percent of what employees in managerial positions paid in Social Security taxes last year, were to have been made to those on the county payroll as of Jan. 31, 1987. However, in November, after his election defeat, Mr. Shapiro signed an executive order changing the date to Dec. 31, 1986.\nMr. Amato called the change ''underhanded.''\n''He knew exactly what he was doing,'' Mr Amato said in an interview on his first working day in office. ''It was not the innocent people he was worried about. He was trying to make sure that his elite guard got it. It's kind of odd that the only checks that were given out and cashed were certain checks to his privileged few.'' No Money Appropriated\nH. Curtis Meanor, a former Federal District Court judge who Mr. Amato has named as acting County Counsel, said that payment on the 234 checks had been stopped, but that between 13 and 20 of them had been cashed. He said that no money had been appropriated to pay for the bonuses.\n''They were charged to the 1986 budget and there is no appropriation in the 1986 budget,'' Mr. Meanor said. ''There is a question as to whether Peter Shapiro acted within his authority. If the old eligibility date can be established, they are not entitled to anything.''\nReached at his home, Mr. Shapiro said the payments were primarily to employees in management and technical positions to compensate for the fact that they were not unionized and did not receive union benefits.\nAs to the Dec. 31 date on the checks, he said this ''was done incorrectly and against my instructions.'' 'Up to Monkey Business'\n''That was sabotage from within,'' he added. ''My instructions were that the payment was to be part of the Jan. 2 paycheck. As soon as I heard that there were special checks dated December 31, I knew that somebody was up to monkey business.''\nHowever, Mr. Meanor said, ''It is clear to me that Mr. Shapiro, by adjusting the date, sought to protect the bonus for those confidential employees who he knew would probably be replaced early in the new administration.''\nMr. Amato added that notices would be sent to those individuals who had cashed the checks advising them that stop-payment orders had been issued.\nThe matter is to come before the courts on Monday, but Mr. Meanor said the matter was moot unless employees sued for payment of the money.\nMr. Amato, who was sworn in Thursday, said his day included meetings with several new staff members -Robert D. Jackson, a management analyst with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey who had been on loan to Mayor Sharpe James of Newark; Brenda J. Veltri, who resigned as Newark's director of personnel to accept a similar position with the county, and Peter J. McDonough, a former administrative assistant to Congressman Dean A. Gallo, who was appointed acting chief of staff. Mr. Amato also met with several holdovers - Joseph A. Martin, the county administrator, and Donald V. Biase, the budget director. The meetings were to complete plans for personnel changes.

They include Bonwit Teller and Garfinckel's. The 16 divisions generated 12 percent of store profits during 1985.\nThe Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation, which sided with Allied to prevent Campeau's takeover, will get a 35 percent interest in what remains of Allied at a cost of $210 million.\nThe financing deals give analysts more reason to question whether Campeau stretched itself too thin to acquire the larger Allied Corporation, which has 691 department and specialty stores in 46 states. Campeau, a Canadian-based builder and shopping center developer, agreed to acquire Allied in November.\nThe Campeau-Allied plans were disclosed in a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in a joint release from Campeau and DeBartolo.\nUnder bank agreements, Allied is required to sell the divisions ''as soon as possible'' to pay off $300 million in debt. Allied said it would not sell other retail units, including Brooks Brothers, Ann Taylor and the Jordan Marsh department stores. It did not specify all 16 divisions that it would sell.\nThe S.E.C. filing also shows that Allied plans securities offerings that would raise more than $1 billion for additional financing. These offerings include $600 million in senior subordinated debentures, $200 million of senior notes and 10 million shares of cumulative exchangeable preferred stock.\nThe company said that besides 16 divisions, it might be forced to sell other assets to meet loan payments.\nAfter the June payment, the company said it owes $500 million by Dec. 31 and a total of $1.1 billion by December 1988.\nEdward J. DeBartolo, the Ohio developer whose bid for Allied was exceeded by Campeau, is lending Campeau $150 million to help finance the purchase.\nIn their joint news statement, the two companies said that Mr. DeBartolo would have the option of making an additional $60 million payment to Allied and converting his loan into a 35 percent equity interest in Allied, the nation's third-largest department store operator.\nMoreover, they said the agreement included ''certain benefits to DeBartolo'' that will enable the developer to ''participate directly in the business development of Allied.''\nFinancial analysts said that Campeau had hurried in order to complete the Allied deal to save millions of dollars in tax benefits that would be lost under the new tax law, which took effect Thursday.\nMeanwhile, the two developers said that Mr. DeBartolo had agreed to purchase the five regional shopping centers owned by Allied for $400 million, but Campeau has an option to purchase back a 50 percent interest for $200 million by March 31. That would leave Mr. DeBartolo with a 50 percent interest in the shopping centers. Originally he was to purchase a 25 percent interest for $112.5 million.

Chile's record on worker rights is to be studied for another year before any action is taken, an Administration official said.\nBecause of an American embargo there is practically no trade with Nicaragua. Trade is minimal with Paraguay and Rumania.\nAnalysts said the moves seemed aimed at blunting Congressional criticism of the Administration for not being ''tough'' enough on trade. ''They might help bank some of the protectionist coals,'' said a Senate aide who follows trade issues.\nRepresentative Jim Wright, the Texas Democrat who is the new House Speaker, called the moves ''a welcome policy change,'' but added that they ''may not have gone far enough.'' At a news conference earlier in the day, he re-emphasized the high priority the 100th Congress will place on coming to grips with the trade deficit, describing it as the ''first imperative.''\nThe Administration actions, which are scheduled to take effect July 1, relate to a program of tariff preferences offered since the last decade by leading industrial countries to spur poorer countries' exports and development. The American program, which has been a target of Congressional criticism, grants duty-free treatment on 3,000 products from 140 developing countries.\nSince its inception in 1976 the annual value of imports receiving duty-free treatment has risen from $3.2 billion, to $13.3 billion in 1985, under the American program. But 90 percent of the benefits go to fewer than a dozen export-oriented countries, mostly in the Pacific Basin.\nThe steps taken today will cut those benefits by an estimated $2 billion, or 23 percent, according to Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States trade representative, who made the announcement for the Administration.\nWhile $3.1 billion of trade could be hurt by loss of the duty-free status, $950 million of trade could be helped by the addition of 95 products from 10 countries to the duty-free list under the review the Administration has just concluded.\nIn addition to Taiwan and South Korea, the newly industrialized developing countries subjected to new tariffs include Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, Yugoslavia, Hong Kong and Argentina.\nThe list of 10 gainers includes some of the same countries that will lose on other products. The 10 are Colombia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Macao, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay.\nTaiwan is the biggest net loser. In 1985 it had $3.2 billion of its exports to the United States coming in under the program known as the Generalized System of Preferences. The new level will be $2 billion, based on the 1985 numbers, a reduction of 37.5 percent.\nOther losers include Brazil, Korea and Mexico. Among the net gainers are Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and Colombia.\nAn official at the Taiwanese Coordination Council for North American Affairs said that ''we understand the situation in view of the political conditions in the United States.'' Trade bills in the House and Senate last year would have cut back the privileges of the preference system sharply.\nIn acting against Paraguay, Rumania and Nicaragua, the Administration acted under 1984 trade legislation calling for termination of preference system eligibility for any country not taking steps toward providing internationally recognized rights to its workers.\nMr. Wright said he thought the Administration's actions under the worker rights provisions were ''long overdue'' and said he was disappointed that Chile and South Korea were not also stripped of their eligibility. David P. Shark, executive director of the preference system program in the Office of the United States Trade Representative, said that Chile had taken a number of liberalizing actions over the last two years.

500	BOLIVIA COCAINE TRADE REVIVES AFTER G.I.'S GO	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D61E39F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: At the airport, the hot wind coming off the savanna whistles among rows of small private planes that have not flown in several months, having been grounded by the authorities.\nAt the airport, the hot wind coming off the savanna whistles among rows of small private planes that have not flown in several months, having been grounded by the authorities.\nThe American troops who landed in July to help combat Bolivia's flourishing cocaine traffic have briefly disrupted the easy life of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, a tropical city that grew prosperous partly from the laundering, recycling and lavish spending of cocaine dollars.\nAfter 170 United States troops tracked down drug laboratories in the forests north of here, the flow of cash dried up, the price of coca leaf tumbled and many drug bosses went into hiding.\n''The day the troops arrived,'' a resident of Santa Cruz recalled, ''all the Mercedes disappeared from the streets.'' Coca Leaf Price Rises\nYet within two months after the American troops left, the cocaine business has bounced back, and by all reports it is operating with greater vigor than ever. The price of the limited supply of coca leaf has gone back up.\n''The pressure is off,'' a narcotics expert said. ''Stocks had fallen very low, so now everybody is replenishing.''\nAlthough the troops ruined about 20 laboratories that turned coca paste into cocaine, officials said several large workshops had started up again in the forests of the hinterlands.\n''Chemicals were hidden and a new crop of leaf is coming in,'' an official said. ''There is this get-it-while-you-can attitude, because people are unsure what will happen next.''\nThis new uncertainty has prompted some racketeers to try to sell their more conspicuous assets, like thoroughbred horses and fast cars.\nAs the authorities sort out the use of up to 300 small planes and temporarily ground them, some nervous traffickers have reportedly hurried to disguise ownership.\n''We are finding funny things, like planes re-registered in the names of mechanics,'' an official said.\nAmong businessmen and shopkeepers around the Santa Cruz plaza - the city's shaded heart, with the cathedral, the Palace of Justice, the police station and other institutions lined up in Spanish colonial style - the future of the cocaine trade and of its economic spin-offs is very much on people's minds. The debate invariably revolves around whether the American presence has made more than a short-term difference.\nAmerican and some Bolivian narcotics experts, though saying it may take several years for drug trafficking to disappear here, regard the arrival of the troops as a turning point. They say it showed the willingness of President Victor Paz Estenssoro to pay the high economic and political price of taking on the drug barons. More important than the gains against the traffickers, they believe, the military operations broke the old taboo that fighting the coca trade would be unpalatable.\nWith six American assault helicopters on loan and a reorganized narcotics police, Bolivia can continue its own crackdowns.\nThe less upbeat view of some diplomats and politicians is that despite his commitment, the President can do little to eliminate corruption among the military and the police, particularly in view of the enormous bribes paid.\nMoreover, the prices of the country's main official exports, natural gas and tin, are badly depressed, and the closing of many tin mines has put tens of thousands out of work. So cocaine revenues - well over $500 million a year by most estimates - have never been more important to Bolivia.\nOne measure of the pull of narcotics, diplomats said, is that the price of coca leaves has risen recently to $150 for a 100-pound bag. Such a bag cost $125 when the United States troops arrived.\nFor Santa Cruz, the outcome of the drug battle will determine whether it enters economic stagnation or maintains its dizzying rate of expansion. The expansion, first through the discovery of oil and then through the cocaine boom, has transformed Santa Cruz from a farming community of 45,000 people two decades ago into Bolivia's second largest city, with a population of more than 600,000. A Recent Phenomenon\nAlthough there was always coca leaf in Bolivia's highlands, entrepreneurs in this lowland region caught on to cocaine only over the last 10 years. They recognized that rather than sending the paste of mashed leaves and chemicals for further processing in Colombia, long the world's cocaine center, it was better business for them to do their own refining and exporting.\n''First we heard of cocaine in grams, then in kilos, then in tons,'' said Hugo Paz, owner of a local bank. ''Money landed in the hands of people not used to working or producing,'' he said, in explaining the new discotheques, bars, brothels, stores, cockfighting places and even a new indoor arena.\nThe cash flow prompted one local bank to open an offshore branch in Panama's financial district. Local people say many cocaine dollars earned in Europe and the United States are also laundered through the importing of expensive cars and aircraft.\nWith the newly rich seeking different status symbols, some acquisitions seemed unusual. A farmer who acquired sudden wealth began to collect dwarf animals - small bulls from Spain, Shetland ponies and miniature cows from Argentina.\n''He has a whole herd of them,'' a neighbor said. ''He told me some of them cost thousands of dollars each.''\nOne telling side-effect of the crackdown, diplomats say, is a sudden rise in drug-related violence. They believe this confirms that the major operators here are unwilling to surrender without a fight.\nSeveral killings have shocked the city. A botanist, his pilot and a guide were shot and killed in October when they accidentally came upon a clandestine laboratory north of here. A member of Congress from Santa Cruz, who promised to reveal the names of the people behind that killing, was then slain in front of his home. Early in December in Cochabamba, a helicopter carrying anti-drug policemen was shot at and forced to make an emergency landing; one passenger was killed.\nSo far, however, no important cocaine boss has been jailed here or elsewhere in Bolivia. Fifteen people arrested here in July, who were said to be important underground figures, have been freed for lack of evidence. The Government has promised changes in the court system and new laws.\nIn Santa Cruz, a new police chief has also been named.\n''Good idea,'' said a foreigner who has lived here for almost 30 years. ''But if they want a police chief with clean hands, he may have to be changed every few weeks.''

Still, he completed passes all night, and the Giants were fortunate to rally for a 21-17 victory.\nFive weeks ago, when the Giants played San Francisco in the regular season, Joe Montana had only recently rejoined the 49ers after back surgery. Still, he completed passes all night, and the Giants were fortunate to rally for a 21-17 victory.\nNow the Giants (14-2) and the 49ers (10-5-1), both division champions, will meet at Giants Stadium Sunday in the National Conference playoffs. And now the Giants must contend with a Joe Montana who seems his former self, and that former self was as dangerous a passer as there was in the National Football League.\nCoach Bill Walsh of the 49ers, perhaps exercising pre-game negative hype, downplays Montana's current form.\n''He's not playing up to his standard of recent years,'' said Walsh, ''but he's still a very effective quarterback.''\n''He looks pretty good to me,'' said Coach Bill Parcells of the Giants. ''He looks like he's doing things better than when his back was bothering him.'' Creates Many Problems\nMontana creates problems for opposing defenses. If he is pressured, he takes short drops and throws quick passes, especially to the dangerous Roger Craig, his fullback. If the linebackers drop back into pass coverage rather than rush Montana, he is not afraid to throw deep, especially to the speedy Jerry Rice.\nIn the regular-season game against the Giants, Montana completed 32 of 52 passes. The longest completion went for only 15 yards and he grossed only 251 yards, small numbers for so many completions.\nThe 49ers intentionally kept their passes short against the Giants' celebrated defense. The 49ers wanted to stop the pass rush, preserve Montana's health and win the game. They succeeded on two out of three.\nWhat Walsh will try this time is anyone's guess.\n''You just can't do the same things time after time against the Giants,'' he said. ''You have to keep them off balance and not get greedy. We have to be patient and play the game and let it run its course rather than try gimmick or low-percentage plays.''\nWhat will the Giants do to stop Montana? Emphasis on Receivers\n''You try to put tight coverage on the receivers early,'' said Parcells. ''You try to jam them. That's always big for us because we're primarily a zone team on defense. He's not going to take sacks early, but if he's trying to catch up or make a first down, he's got to hold the ball to do it.''\nWhen the quarterback throws from a deep drop, it is an invitation to a sack. If his receivers cannot get open, the invitation is still there.\n''So you've got to jam them,'' said Carl Banks, the Giants' outside linebacker. ''Obviously, we can't count on getting a lot of sacks, because he drops shorter and throws quicker than most quarterbacks.\n''But shorter drops mean shorter passes, which is not necessarily good for us. If we make the tackle immediately and they gain 2 or 3 yards, O.K., but we can't miss tackles. And Montana is very smart and very mobile, and he still isn't afraid to run.'' Strength May Play Role\nThe Giants may attack Montana's passing simply by trying to outplay the 49ers physically. If they try that, it will be because they believe they can play their regular defense and win.\n''We can defend most any play they put up there,'' said Gary Reasons, the Giants' inside linebacker. ''They'll make some plays in the long run, but I think we can match up with them. I don't think Bill Parcells will get in a guessing game. I think we'll just do what we do.\n''In our last game against them, our run support wasn't good, we missed tackles and across the board we didn't play well. That's why they were able to do some things. I don't think we will do that again.'' WILLIAMS'S ANKLE IMPROVED\nPerry Williams, the Giants' starting right cornerback, said he was feeling no ill effects from an ankle he turned slightly earlier in the week. . . . Parcells said he had not yet decided whether to reactivate Lionel Manuel Saturday. The star wide receiver has been on injured reserve since he sprained his left knee in the fourth week of the season. . . . The Giants will hold their usual light Saturday workout in the morning at Giants Stadium and the 49ers will do the same in the afternoon. . . . If the Giants beat the 49ers, they will play the conference championship game here the following Sunday against the winner of Saturday's game in Chicago between the Washington Redskins and the Bears. If the Giants are still in the race, said Parcells, they will work out here all week rather than seek a warm-weather training site in the South.

LoGrande, the new chief executive of Suffolk County, today voiced fears about the strength of the soaring local economy and said he would seek ways to reduce county spending.\nMichael A. LoGrande, the new chief executive of Suffolk County, today voiced fears about the strength of the soaring local economy and said he would seek ways to reduce county spending.\nIn his first State of the County address, Mr. LoGrande, recently selected to fill a one-year vacancy as County Executive, said he planned to appoint an economic advisory council to recommend ways for the government to ''ease off'' growth in the economy.\n''The county's economy is operating on a rubber band that is stretched very tautly,'' he said at a news conference after his speech. ''We must ease off or the economy may break.''\nPrivate-sector jobs in the county rose by 94,000, or 33 percent, during the six years ended in September 1985, the Federal Department of Labor reported.\nMr. LoGrande's speech was overshadowed, however, by a loud and divisive fight over who would become presiding officer of the County Legislature. Blass Is Victorious\nThat position, which is seen as the county's second most powerful government job, went to the Republican incumbent, Gregory J. Blass, after a battle among Republicans.\nA Republican caucus agreed on Wednesday to support Gerard J. Glass, a 27-year-old legislator from the Town of Lindenhurst, for the post.\nThe decision of the Republican majority to replace Mr. Blass, who is seen within his party as a maverick, drew about 50 protesters who oppose the opening of the Shoreham nuclear power plant. Mr. Blass has been a more outspoken opponent of the plant than has Mr. Glass, who has also taken an anti-Shoreham stance. The protesters jammed the Legislature's meeting hall today, holding signs and interrupting the meeting.\nSince his selection as County Executive, Mr. LoGrande, a Republican, has repeatedly stressed his plans to work closely with the Legislature. But his goal appeared to be derailed almost immediately today as he acted as temporary chairman of the organizational session of the Legislature.\nAfter Mr. Glass failed to receive a majority of votes on the first ballot, Mr. LoGrande called a recess and left the Legislature's chamber. The Legislature's Democrats called his action ''despicable'' and ''unlawful.'' The decisive votes against Mr. Glass and for Mr. Blass were cast by Patrick A. Mahoney, a Republican from West Islip, who was subsequently elected deputy presiding officer.\nIn his news conference, which was dominated by questions about his call for a recess, Mr. LoGrande defended his move, denying that he had participated in ''backroom politics.''\n''The one thing I did not want to do was get involved with the legislative race for presiding officer,'' he said. ''But signals got crossed every which way.''\nMany in the Legislature have criticized the county leadership of the Republican Party for naming Mr. LoGrande to complete the term of Peter F. Cohalan without holding a special election. Mr. Cohalan resigned after winning election to the state judiciary. The Legislature must vote within a month on a Democratic call for a special election for county executive.\nIn his speech, Mr. LoGrande outlined a direction for the county government, which he said ''is at a crossroads.''\nHe said that within two weeks he planned to direct department heads to cut 5 percent of ''nonmandated'' costs from their budgets. Also, he said he planned to institute a hiring freeze ''that will be sweeping but will allow for critical positions to be filled so as not to interrupt services.''

''I believe in truth in packaging,'' he said.\nMr. Koch said he wishes the teams success in their playoff games this weekend, but said he told Mayor Dianne Feinstein of San Francisco that ''she had the wrong telephone number'' when she sought to repeat their bet of last year.\n''I told her to call Governor Kean of New Jersey or the Mayor of Moonachie,'' Mr. Koch said.\nHe mispronounced the name, calling it ''mah-NOO-chee'' instead of ''moo-NAH-key,'' but professed to have great affection for the town of 3,000, a few miles from Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands.\nMayor Frederick J. Dressler of Moonachie said, ''I'll take the bet - if Mayor Feinstein calls - but I'll make my own and not follow up what Koch did.'' The bet he proposes? ''I'll sing 'I Left My Heart in San Francisco' if they win, and she'll have to sing our town song if the Giants win.'' The song, ''Moonachie,'' was written by a teacher for the town's 75th anniversary celebration in 1985. Looking at a 'Pig in a Poke'\nMayor Feinstein's deputy press secretary, Bill Strawn, said she decided not to follow through with the Moonachie offer after Mr. Koch turned her down. ''She was a little surprised because he agreed to bet last year and she sent him a dozen prime steaks after the Giants won,'' he said. ''She enjoys these wagers.''\nOf his bet last year, Mr. Koch said, ''I was overly generous, but now I look at every pig in a poke.'' He said he has decided that what is in the poke belongs to New Jersey, not to New York.\nMr. Kean said ''it would be nice'' if the Jets and Giants would change their names - ''Jersey Jets and Giants has a nice ring to it'' - but he added, ''I call them that anyway, and always have.''\nThe teams have removed the ''NY'' logo from their helmets and call themselves ''the Jets'' and ''the Giants,'' although they are referred to as New York teams by the rest of the league.\nThat has rankled New Jersey officials, who placed a large decal on the 50-yard line in Giants Stadium that has a map of the state ringed by the words ''New Jersey Meadowlands.''\nMr. Kean said he is not looking for bets but he will accept them starting in the next round. ''I have to be careful; with two teams in the playoffs I might have to bet double or nothing.''\n''Someday we're going to have two teams in the Super Bowl,'' he said. ''If that happens soon I'll have to sit somewhere in the middle of the stadium.''

We've had some accidents and a couple of break-ins, but that's normal.''\nThe City Finance Director, Calvin D. McCracken, shoveled snow from the steps of City Hall, where code enforcement offices were closed and other agencies, like the Treasurer's office, were staffed by supervisors without clerical help.\nFirefighters and police officers handled routine telephone calls to City Hall offices. The city's municipal garages stayed open as coin boxes replaced attendants to accept parkers' fees.\nMore than 50 members of the police force, 30 of the 58 firefighters and nearly all nonuniformed workers walked off the job Thursday after the city entered the new year without a new municipal budget. Budget Proposal at Issue\nMayor Herbert Pfuhl said today that he expected no change in the situation until at least next week, when he said he would probably veto the City Council's proposal for a $7.7 million municipal budget.\nMr. Pfuhl, citing a budget shortage, has proposed a $6.7 million budget that includes a reduction in all municipal departments. Under his plan, the police force would be cut to 29 officers from 56 officers and the Fire Department would be cut to 28 firefighters from 58.\nMr. McCracken has said that local banks would refuse to grant the city loans in anticipation of tax revenue if the Council's budget was adopted.\nMembers of Flood City Lodge 86 of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents police officers, and Local 630 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents nonuniform workers, walked off the job Thursday.\nFirefighters who would remain under the Mayor's budget continued to work, but only in the downtown firehouse.\nJohnstown is best known for the 1889 flood that killed more than 2,200 people. The city of about 35,000 people has suffered economically in recent years, mostly through cutbacks at a Bethlehem Steel Corporation mill.

''When you come in here, you see the sky as the limit,'' Smith said on the U.S.C. campus. ''I'm a very goal-oriented person and we'll shoot for the stars.'' Smith, who turned struggling programs into winners at Arizona and Tulane, inherits a team that was 7-5 under Ted Tollner this season, including a 16-7 loss to Auburn in the Florida Citrus Bowl. Smith said he has no timetable, and that his top goal will be for the athletes to earn degrees. ''We're not going to come in here and make wholesale changes,'' Smith said. ''It's going to mostly be a matter of molding the players into a team, in the style I and my coaches are used to.'' Smith said he intends to bring eight of his assistants along with him, and one other assistant will be hired, or retained off Tollner's staff. Tollner, who had a 26-20-1 record at U.S.C., was dismissed following the end of the regular season, effective after the Citrus Bowl.

506	STATE AIDE SEEKS VICTIMS' VERSION IN QUEENS CASE	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DF1F39F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The special state prosecutor for criminal justice in New York City appealed yesterday to lawyers for black victims of the Howard Beach attack to substantiate their charges that the police and the Queens District Attorney had mishandled the investigation.\nThe special state prosecutor for criminal justice in New York City appealed yesterday to lawyers for black victims of the Howard Beach attack to substantiate their charges that the police and the Queens District Attorney had mishandled the investigation.\nStepping into a case riddled with contradictions and stymied in court, the special prosecutor, Charles J. Hynes, publicly asked the lawyers to reach him over the weekend and provide evidence that the authorities were ignoring or covering up vital elements of inquiry.\nBut the lawyers, Alton H. Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason, promptly rebuffed the appeal and repeated their demands that Federal prosecutors or a special state prosecutor named by Governor Cuomo take over the prosecution of the case from the District Attorney, John J. Santucci.\nThe impasse appeared to set the stage for a full-scale investigation next week by Mr. Hynes into charges by the lawyers that the authorities had mistreated their client, Cedric Sandiford, and had suppressed his account of the death of his 23-year-old stepson, Michael Griffith, who was killed by a car while fleeing an attack by white youths.\nMr. Sandiford, 36, who has made no public statements on one of the worst racial incidents in the city in years, said he would attend a public forum at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem today and tell what happened in Howard Beach early on Dec. 20.\nAs the complex case moved into its third week, there were these other developments:\n* Mayor Koch met at City Hall with black and white leaders of Queens and Howard Beach and expressed concern that the community's name was being equated with racism. ''We should not pillory a whole community,'' the Mayor declared.\n* An interracial group calling itself Concerned Citizens of South Queens denounced the attacks but defended Howard Beach as a fair-minded community and called on clerics to preach sermons and hold prayer vigils encouraging racial harmony.\n* A coalition of black groups called for a citywide ''day of mourning and outrage'' for the black victims on Jan. 21 and said they were considering plans for a black boycott of businesses and schools that day.\n* New York City school officials said security in the schools - including John Adams High School in Ozone Park, where three white youths accused in the attack are enrolled - was being reviewed to insure safety when classes resume Monday.\n* Judge Ernest Bianchi of Criminal Court in Queens, who dismissed murder, manslaughter and assault charges against the whites last Monday for insufficient evidence, defended his actions in a passionate courtroom statement during a hearing for three black youths accused of attacking a white teen-ager as they chanted slogans of revenge for Howard Beach. The judge upheld assault charges against two of the black youths and dismissed the charges against the third. Attack on 3 Blacks\nThe Howard Beach case stems from an attack by a group of white youths on three blacks - Mr. Griffith, Mr. Sandiford and Timothy Grimes - early Dec. 20 as the blacks walked through the community just west of Kennedy International Airport after their car broke down. The whites beat them with fists, a baseball bat and a tree limb in an eight-block chase that ended at 1 A.M. at 156th Avenue and 86th Street, beside a chain-link fence of the Shore Parkway. Mr. Grimes had escaped earlier.\nThe police said Mr. Sandiford told them that he and Mr. Griffith ran through a hole in the fence to escape and that he saw a dark car involved in the chase appear again on the parkway. They quoted him as having said he did not witness the fatal crash.\nMr. Griffith was struck and killed by a car driven by Dominick Blum, a 24-year-old court officer, who left the scene, returned an hour later and was not charged after telling the police he thought he had hit a tire or an animal. The police later said their investigation showed that Mr. Blum was not part of the attack and that he had killed Mr. Griffith accidentally.\nMr. Maddox and Mr. Mason have contended that Mr. Sandiford saw the crash, that Mr. Blum was an accomplice of the white youths and that he deliberately killed Mr. Griffith. They have charged that the police and the prosecutor are covering up Mr. Sandiford's evidence and have said their client will not cooperate unless Mr. Blum is charged with murder and the case is turned over to an independent prosecutor.\nBut the lawyers have not given detailed evidence to support their charges, and while the police have denied the allegations and cited details to support their accounts, numerous gaps, discrepancies and contradictions in the official version have left doubts among many about what happened.\nIn an effort to determine if authorities mishandled the case, Mr. Hynes, whose title is Deputy Attorney General and Special Prosecutor for the New York City Criminal Justice System, appealed yesterday to the lawyers to provide him with evidence of their contentions. He said he would be willing to meet ''anywhere, anytime.''\n''Right now, we have nothing more than allegations,'' Mr. Hynes said. ''I haven't seen any evidence to support them. If by Monday I haven't heard from them, then I'll take the next step. I think these are very serious charges and there has to be some resolution.''\nMr. Hynes did not say what his next step would be, but legal experts said he would probably open a full-scale inquiry into the charges and into the handling of the case by the police and the prosecutor. The experts said Mr. Hynes would not supersede Mr. Santucci as prosecutor in the case. Mason Assails Hynes's Role\nBy late yesterday, Mr. Hynes said he had not heard from the lawyers.\nBut Mr. Mason, in an interview, criticized Mr. Hynes's intervention as inadequate and said Mr. Sandiford would not cooperate until either Federal prosecutors or a special prosecutor named by Governor Cuomo took over the case from Mr. Santucci.\n''With all due respect to Mr. Hynes,'' Mr. Mason said, ''he is not the proper prosecutor to deal with this case. We want a comprehensive and thorough investigation on a state and Federal level and the appropriate thing for the Governor to do is appoint a special prosecutor.''\nMr. Mason said Assemblyman Roger L. Green, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus, and James Bell, president of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, had both asked Mr. Cuomo to name a special prosecutor.\nThe lawyer said Mr. Sandiford would cooperate with Mr. Hynes if a special prosecutor were named to supersede Mr. Santucci. But he accused the Governor of maintaining a ''wall of silence'' and of showing an absence of ''moral leadership.'' He said Mr. Cuomo had not condemned the attack or visited the families of the victims.\n''If he has national ambitions,'' Mr. Mason said, ''we don't intend to sit silently by and allow him to project himself to the nation that he is the Governor of all the people in this state. He is not.'' Cuomo Aide Denounces Maddox\nThe Governor's press secretary, Martin Steadman, who denounced Mr. Maddox Thursday as having ''zero credibility,'' retorted that the charges against the Governor were ''totally untrue.'' He said Mr. Cuomo had repeatedly condemned the attack and had not visited the families because he was tied up with state business in Albany.\nMr. Cuomo's Director of Criminal Justice, Lawrence T. Kurlander, who asked Mr. Hynes to look into the case, said the Governor did not intend to name a special prosecutor to supersede Mr. Santucci because ''we already have in place a special prosecutor designed to deal precisely with this kind of thing - a man whose reputation is one of honesty and integrity and who is fully capable of dealing with these matters. Possibility of Civil Rights Case\nAfter the dismissal of the most serious charges against the white youths -an action that left only reckless endangerment charges pending against Jon L. Lester, 17; Scott Kern, 17, and Jason Ladone, 16 - law-enforcement officials said Mr. Santucci faced a difficult decision on whether to take the case before a grand jury.\nWithout the testimony of Mr. Sandiford - the only person besides the suspects and their friends who saw what happened - chances of a successful prosecution were doubtful, legal experts said. But some law-enforcement officials said that Mr. Santucci might turn the case over to Federal prosecutors as a civil-rights matter.

''There's always been traffic through Texas, but now smugglers are changing their supply routes, and we're seeing more of it.'' Two Mexicans Are Arrested\nMr. Ramos, a 30-year-old native of the Bronx who worked for the agency 18 months, was slain while trying to arrest a narcotics suspect three miles north of the Mexican border near Pharr, Tex.\nTwo Mexican nationals living in South Texas were subsequently arrested. One, Felipe Molina-Uribe, 29 years old, who was shot in the leg in the attempted arrest, was charged with murdering a Federal agent. He and Benito Cavazos-Lamas, 25 years old, were charged with possession with intent to distribute 303 pounds of marijuana and conspiring to possess the drugs with the intent of distributing them.\nMr. Ramos, a former assistant prosecutor in Mohave, Ariz., who held a law degree from the University of Arizona, was the second Rio Grande Valley narcotics officer to die in two months.\nManuel Segovia of the Hidalgo County Sheriff's Department was shot to death Oct. 31 in a raid at a trailer home near the Rio Grande Valley town of Mercedes.\nBefore that, the last drug agency agent to die on duty was Enrique Camarena Salazar, who was killed in February 1985 in Guadalajara, Mexico. Drug Labs in Mexico\nSouth Texas has always been a prime area for drug smuggling. But officials say they are seeing a major increase in drug traffic as more smugglers bypass the heavily patrolled South Florida area. In addition, drug agents say cocaine laboratories and other drug facilities are now becoming much more common in Mexico.\nOfficials also say they are seeing more links between Colombian and Mexican drug smugglers, increasing the drug flow through Mexico.\nOfficials in Florida make no claims of controlling the drug traffic there. But after drug arrests grew from 1,634 in 1982 to 6,620 in 1985, from 1,634 in 1982, and seizures of cocaine to 110,000 pounds in 1985, from 5,303 pounds in 1982, officials with the South Florida Task Force on drug enforcement say they expect final 1986 figures to show little or no growth.\n''It's like a balloon - you squish in one side and it bulges out on the other,'' said Al Crespo, assistant to the staff coordinator for the South Florida project. ''But that doesn't mean were not seeing large quantities still coming our way.'' Increase in Arrests\nBorder Patrol sectors in Texas say they have seen increasing drug traffic over the last year.\nPhil Jordan, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's office in Dallas, said arrests by his division, which handles a territory from the Rio Grande in West Texas to Oklahoma with fewer than 100 agents, grew to 856 in 1986 from 686 in 1985. He said cocaine arrests accounted for much of the rise.\nMr. Jordan said the vast open land and porous nature of the border made the 2,000-mile-long border with Mexico particularly inviting for smugglers. And he said drugs were transported by car, truck and plane and concealed in a variety of ways. ''You have body mules, people carrying it across in body cavities,'' he said. ''You have mothers smuggling junk in the the diapers of babies.'' 'People Will Do Anything'\nOfficials hope new agents expected this year and a recently begun effort to marshal diverse law-enforcement agencies in an alliance, as part of the Reagan Administration's war on drugs, will help provide a more effective anti-drug presence.\nThe two recent shootings were unrelated, but Mr. Jordan said drug trafficking was becoming an increasingly violent world.\n''I've been in law enforcement for 27 years,'' he said, ''and the violence within the last several years, in my estimation, is the worst I've seen in the way drug traffickers are arming themselves and killing others without hesitation, without regard for human life.\n''You're talking about multimillion-dollar deals, drug trafficking empires that people will do anything to defend.''

Specialists and surgeons worked through the night to treat those with severe burns or bones broken by hotel guests jumping from lower levels of the burning hotel.\nBut as each commercial airliner arriving in San Juan brought desperate relatives seeking word on the fate of the victims, the government here remained on holiday. Information became a premium commodity. Holiday Until Jan. 6\nThe Christmas season in Puerto Rico is a very festive and long holiday, extending through Three Kings Day, the Feast of the Epiphany, on Jan. 6.\nOn Dec. 31, 1972, a cargo plane carrying relief supplies to the victims of an earthquake in Nicaragua took off from San Juan International Airport and crashed into the sea. On the plane was the baseball player Roberto Clemente, a hero of this island.\nBut that disaster required no official response other than sorrow and memorials. The Dupont Plaza fire and its aftermath required a mobilizing of resources to care for the living and the dead. There was a pervasive feeling here over the past 48 hours that the government's response was slow, tentative and unfocused.\nToday, as well as New Year's Day, was an official day off for all of the government workers of the United States commonwealth, and most of the public life of San Juan was brought to a standstill except for the busy scene at the hotel, which remains cordoned off in the middle of the Condado Beach section. Efforts Appear Haphazard\nAs a result, government efforts to deal with the disaster have appeared at times to be haphazard and uncoordinated.\nThose public officials who presented themselves to assist the press often had only pleasant smiles and numbers for telephones that were never answered.\nHeads of commonwealth agencies made themselves available for interviews in front of the television cameras but often could not help frantic relatives find hospitals where family members might be among the patients or provide basic facts to satisfy the media. . Wisps of Fact and Fiction\nCasualty lists never seemed to get compiled to provide up-to-date information from the several hospitals caring for the injured. No central clearinghouse for information was created, forcing relatives of the victims and journalists alike to chase after elusive wisps of fact that often dissolved into fiction.\nThe situation was painful for the relatives making searches of hospitals and, as a last recourse, the morgue.\nRelatives and friends sat dazed, waiting in a large room at Rio Piedras Medical Center where the dead were taken for the slow process of identifying those whose features no longer existed. Catherine Pagan was bitter. ''No one has been able to help me,'' she said today after making the rounds in two days of nine hospitals and the morgue. Her husband, Victor, a 30-year-old superviser at the hotel casino, was among those listed as missing in the fire.\nHer bitterness shielded her fear of learning what she dreaded. But no counselors, no official agency - indeed, no one was there to tell her to return home and wait for a summons to the morgue while they intervened in her behalf.\nAt the Dupont Plaza, the press for the most part milled around the perimeter of the hotel, standing on the asphalt on Ashford Avenue, hoping to spring on any official-looking visitor to the site to pry fact or conjecture to support the latest rumor. Interviews on the Spot\nAn impromptu interview that begins one on one, in English or in Spanish, soon attracts attention as more reporters pick up the thread of content. If it seems promising, like a pigeon feasting on bread crumbs, the dispenser of information inherits a thick ring of attention. The television crews trot out with camera and lights, asking for everything to be repeated, in both English and then Spanish.\nThe seat of all official information is reputed to be the office of Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon. Over the holidays the caller is referred to two telephone numbers for the police and other official ''task force'' information. These numbers are invariably busy.\nWhen a caller gets through after several tries and asks the official at the other end of the line for the latest count of the dead in the fire, the official dryly responds: ''I am not authorized to give the number of the dead. To get the number of the dead you must call the Director of Tourism.''\nThe official supplies a telephone number. No one answers.

Orlando Woolridge led the Nets with 29 points, while Buck Williams added 20.\nDennis Rodman, a rookie, scored the final two field goals of the first half, the second on a driving layup after stealing the ball from Mike Gminski. Detroit led by 65-54 at halftime.\nRick Mahorn, a reserve forward for Detroit, did not dress for the game because of a bruised tailbone. A team spokesman said Mahorn is doubtful for the game Saturday night at Chicago.\nJohnson, a reserve guard, was 7 of 7 from the field in the fourth quarter.\n''What goes through my mind when you're shooting like that is, 'Hey, I'm going to hit the next one,' '' Johnson said.\n''You feel like you can't miss in that situation,'' he said. ''We've got two great point guards in Joe and Isiah. Guys are setting picks for you. You've got the open shot. You just nail it.''\nWoolridge said the Nets simply ran out of time.\n''It's just a pity we didn't have another minute on the clock,'' said Woolridge, who fell 2 points short of his season high.\n''We know they're a running team,'' Woolridge said. ''We didn't want to run at their tempo; we wanted to run at our tempo. They set the tempo early. We weren't in our rhythm early in the game.''

Earlier, mallards and black ducks nested on small knolls.\nDuring the fall migration, sandpipers came to feed in the new mud flats. Earlier, mallards and black ducks nested on small knolls.\nThe birds were attracted to a new 63-acre salt marsh, designed by man and gouged out by power shovel and grader on a desolate tract here between the New Jersey Turnpike and the Hackensack River.\nBefore this wildlife oasis was created, the land was covered with 15-foot-tall marsh reeds called Phragmites. Now, it is open and washed by the tidal waters of the Hackensack and a tributary, Mill Creek, and is fast becoming a busy wading and feeding sanctuary amid the commercial development of the Hackensack Meadowlands. Required for Development\nOne of the busiest builders in the Meadowlands, Hartz Mountain Industries, has spent about $5 million creating the marsh since late 1984 and planning to expand it to 30 acres across the turnpike, according to a spokesman, Martin Gold.\nHartz Mountain's investment was required by the Army Corps of Engineers in exchange for permits to fill in other wetlands for construction of the Plaza at the Meadow, a development of offices, theaters and stores about a mile south of the marsh.\n''I'm incredibly impressed with how well this environmental mitigation has worked,'' said Dr. Mark Kraus, a natural resources specialist with the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, a state agency that oversees zoning and building in the Meadowlands. ''I was skeptical at first. But it's surpassed any of my expectations.'' Dr. Kraus called the new marsh the Meadowlands' first large-scale, privately financed attempt to make a tract there more accessible and hospitable to wildlife. An Open-Land Zoning Law\nOver the last dozen years, several portions of the 32-square-mile Meadowlands District have undergone major housing and commercial development. Perhaps the most notable is the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which includes Giants Stadium, the Meadowlands Racetrack, and the Brendan T. Byrne Meadowlands Arena. The complex is about two miles west of the new marsh.\nZoning laws in the Meadowlands require developers to keep 50 percent of their land free of structures. But until the recent Hartz Mountain project, Dr. Kraus said, builders had not been required to undertake a major reshaping of wetlands to make them more appealing to wildlife.\nMuch of the impetus for this comes from tougher enforcement of wetlands regulations in the Federal Clean Water Act by the Army Corps of Engineers, according to Michael Bontje, a biologist for the Manhattan-based environmental science and engineering company of Tippetts, Abbetts, McCarthy & Stratton, which is building the marsh.\nGenerally, Mr. Bontje said, the Corps now requires that for each acre of wetlands developed, another acre must be environmentally enhanced.\nWhen work on the new marsh began two years ago, a herbicide was applied to kill the dense reed grass growing in terrain that was moist but rarely widely covered by water.\nThen, he said, 11 acres of channels were dug two feet below sea level. The average elevation of 45 other acres was lowered by one foot. The channels now draw in tidal waters from the Hackensack River and Mill Creek and disperse them over the 45 acres, creating pools at high tide and mud flats at low tide.\nEarth from the excavations was piled next to the flats to create the knolls that serve as nesting sites.\n''Before, maybe only 5 to 10 percent of the habitat was usable by wildlife, and then only at low tide,'' Mr. Bontje said. ''Now, we've got habitat available around the clock, for wading, feeding, and resting throughout the tidal cycle.''\nThe entire site was planted with Spartina, a chord grass common in salt marshes. It grows to about 4 feet and far less densely than the Phragmites, thus allowing animals freer movement and wider range.\nLast summer, Dr. Kraus made his first formal study of the marsh's viability, examining colonization of worms, snails and other small crustaceans. In each square meter of marshland, he found an average of more than 5,000 of these creatures. On an adjacent site still covered with Phragmites, each square meter yielded an average of only 107.\n''It's a safe assumption that this wouldn't be the case if the channels weren't dug,'' Dr. Kraus said.

514	NORTH'S RECORD: A WIDE ROLE IN A HOST OF SENSITIVE PROJECTS	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB1F39F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Rarely has one man's silence stirred such curiosity or held such consequence as that of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North.\nRarely has one man's silence stirred such curiosity or held such consequence as that of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North.\nSince he was dismissed from the National Security Council staff by President Reagan on Nov. 25 for his purported role in diverting profits from the Iranian arms sales to Nicaraguan rebels, Colonel North has said virtually nothing about his role in the affair.\nIn recent weeks, however, through interviews with more than 40 current and former top-ranking officials in the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon, a clearer picture of Colonel North's five-year career at the National Security Council has emerged. Colonel Declined Interview\nThe extent of Colonel North's complicity in the events that led to the White House crisis and his dismissal has yet to be fully revealed. Neither Colonel North nor his attorney would be interviewed for this account.\nColonel North, his colleagues said, was one of a small group of ideological, independent-minded aides from the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department that formulated plans for secret programs in Central America, the Caribbean, Europe and the Middle East.\nColonel North's power within the group grew with the number of years he spent with the Administration, and his influence was strengthened by turnover on the National Security Council staff and the deaths of several key Presidential and military aides.\nAlthough Colonel North never gained complete control of any single secret action, these sources said, he was able to alter decisions and helped to draw up plans for many of the Administration's most sensitive programs. Grenada, El Salvador, Lebanon\nWhite House and National Security Council sources said these were among the programs in which Colonel North played a vital role:\n* The invasion of Grenada in the fall of 1983.\n* Operations by the Central Intelligence Agency, starting in the spring of 1983, to supply Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, with arms, munitions and other supplies.\n* The mining of three harbors in Nicaragua in early 1984.\n* The reduction in the activity of death squads in El Salvador, and the elections there in 1984.\n* Monitoring the hijacking to Beirut of a Trans World Airlines plane in the summer of 1985 and planning for the possibility that the United States would use military force to free 39 American hostages on the flight.\n* Planning and assisting in the interception of an Egyptian airliner carrying the hijackers of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro, and the diversion of the plane to Italy in the fall of 1985.\n* Assisting the Administration's program to sell arms to Iran in exchange for Iran's help in freeing American hostages held in Lebanon, beginning in the fall of 1985.\n* Assisting in plans to bomb Libya in the spring of 1986 after terrorist attacks in Europe that the Administration linked to the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. An Impulsive, Intelligent Officer\nFriends and colleagues say Colonel North was an impulsive, intelligent and tenaciously ambitious military officer at the height of his energies. He precisely fit the needs of a President who disdained the details of governing and whose closest advisers were neither experts in foreign affairs nor proficient in executing complex operations.\nThese sources said Colonel North, 43 years old, was able to expedite plans for secret programs because he knew every office in the foreign affairs sectors of the Government whose officials had to be briefed, and he had personal relationships with their directors. Served Under Four Advisers\nColonel North also served under four national security advisers in five years and found that the almost annual change in leadership and continual turnover in the staff was an advantage to him. Former and current members of the council's staff say he served as the institutional memory of the National Security Council, providing a continuity that made him almost indispensable.\nColleagues also say Colonel North seemed to feel that embellishing his role could enhance his image and power. He often indicated to friends and colleagues, for instance, that he had a close personal relationship with Mr. Reagan when he did not, according to these associates.\nMost colleagues admired Colonel North's diligence, saying nobody worked longer hours at the White House and few had more creative ideas. ''Oliver North is a superb officer,'' said Gen. Paul F. Gorman, retired commander of the Southern Command, based in Panama, who worked with Colonel North on many Central American initiatives. ''He's the kind of guy I would want to have in any period of stress or danger. But it was necessary, from time to time, to rein him in.''\nBut Colonel North acquired enemies during his final two years at the White House because of a growing reputation for recklessness and for exaggerating his role in some programs.\n''He would say things like, 'I just talked with the boss,' meaning Reagan, 'and the boss said such and such,' '' a former White House official who worked with Colonel North recalled. ''A couple of times I went up there to check whether Ollie had seen the President. And he hadn't, of course.'' A Temporary Assignment Colonel North was a highly regarded junior officer when he joined the staff of the National Security Council on Aug. 4, 1981, on a temporary assignment. His mission: to prepare briefing documents that would help the Administration complete an $8.5 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that included five advanced Awacs radar planes.\nOn Oct. 28, 1981, the Administration gained its first important foreign policy victory when the Senate approved the sale. The same month, the Marine Corps made Colonel North's temporary assignment at the National Security Council a standard three-year tour of duty. He became a member of the defense policies group and specialized in counterterrorism. In the summer of 1984 and again in 1985, Colonel North received extensions of his tour of duty after requests to the Marine Corps from Robert C. McFarlane, then the national security adviser.\nAmong his first projects as a full-time staff member, colleagues say, was the modernization of the National Security Council's crisis management center. He worked with Dr. Richard Smith Beal, a systems analyst and Presidential special assistant.\nWhen the project was completed in early 1983 the center bristled with powerful computers, communications equipment to provide highly secret intelligence reports and elaborate wall-mounted electronic panels.\nBit by bit, Colonel North moved into a position of prominence on the agency's staff. His work on the command center impressed William P. Clark, the No. 2 man at the State Department who moved over to become national security adviser in early January 1982, after Richard V. Allen resigned.\nMr. Clark allowed Colonel North to act as the unofficial staff officer in charge of crisis management. Colonel North was privy to most of the intelligence reports and sensitive message traffic coming into the crisis center, and he routed messages to officials throughout the National Security Council and the White House, according to former staff members of the agency.\nColonel North's role as a crisis manager expanded after Dr. Beal became ill. Dr. Beal, who was 38 years old, died on Nov. 2, 1984, after complications from open heart surgery.\nColonel North also found an admirer in Mr. McFarlane, who arrived with Mr. Clark from the State Department to become the deputy national security adviser. On Oct. 17, 1983, Mr. McFarlane was promoted by President Reagan to the top job. Mr. McFarlane, who had graduated from the Naval Academy in 1959, nine years before Colonel North, and was a lieutenant colonel before he retired from the Marine Corps, understood the younger man's ambition and embraced his ideas, former council staff members say.\nUnder Mr. Clark and Mr. McFarlane, Colonel North was allowed to set his own agenda. Through the latter half of 1982 and early 1983, he traveled frequently to Central America to work with American military advisers.\nIn the spring of 1983, Colonel North joined a group formed by Faith Ryan Whittlesey, head of the White House Office of Public Liaison, and began delivering weekly briefings on Central America at the Executive Office Building for leaders of conservative public policy groups concerned about the Administration's program in the region.\nHe became known in and out of the Government as one of the most influential White House experts on political and military conflicts in Latin America, primarily because his message seemed authentic. The 'I Was There' Factor\n''He had the I.W.T. factor - I was there,'' said F. Andy Messing Jr., executive director of the National Defense Council Foundation in Alexandria, Va., and a former Green Beret who became close to Colonel North.\nThe briefings introduced Colonel North to conservative political activists, who invited him to speak to conservative groups across the country.\nThe members of these groups turned to Colonel North to help them gain access to White House officials and the President. Colonel North turned to them for contacts and money. From late 1984 until he was dismissed, according to political group leaders, Colonel North went to wealthy conservatives for contributions to finance a private supply operation for the contras.\nProbably the most important step in Colonel North's career, according to former staff members, occurred in the spring of 1983 when he was appointed to a secret Central America policy group that met regularly at the State Department.\nThe group, called the Restricted Interagency Group, was formed in 1981 by Thomas O. Enders, then Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. Along with Mr. Enders, the group's members included Duane Clarridge, a Central Intelligence Agency official and expert on covert operations; Vice Adm. Arthur S. Moreau Jr., a representative from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Nestor Sanchez, a representative from the office of the Secretary of Defense. Colonel North substituted for a number of National Security Council officials starting in the late winter of 1983.\nIn May, Mr. Enders was removed from his State Department post and replaced by Langhorne A. Motley.\nColonel North became a permanent member of the interagency group in June 1983, when he rose to deputy director of political-military affairs on the National Security Council staff. Mining Nicaraguan Harbors\nThe change in the committee assignment coincided with a string of events in Central America and the Caribbean in which, according to former and current White House officials, Colonel North was a very active participant.\nAmong the programs the group considered was a plan to mine Nicaraguan harbors with percussion bombs in order to hinder shipments of arms and civilian supplies to Nicaragua. During the winter of 1983, according to Mr. Enders, the proposal was brought to the group by Mr. Clarridge of the C.I.A. The idea was rejected, Mr. Enders said.\nIn June, the mining proposal was made again, and approved, a Washington source said.\nColonel North and Mr. Clarridge, along with staff members of the C.I.A., National Security Council and the military, planned the operation, the source said. When it became public in April 1984, it caused a furor in Congress.\n''It was the first time that Colonel North's name came across our desks,'' said a former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. ''If you consider how that operation was run, the arrogance of it, and compare it to the Iran-contra affair, there are similarities.'' Invading Grenada\nIn mid-October 1983, the interagency group began to play a crucial role in plans to invade Grenada.\n''The group didn't plan the military maneuver; the Joint Chiefs did that,'' the Washington source said. ''But the group offered the invasion option, and planned for it. Ollie North was one of the four or five people below the cabinet rank who could be said to live with Grenada from before people could spell it to when the students kissed the ground in Charleston.'' The source was referring to a group of American medical students in Grenada whom the Reagan Administration said it had acted to evacuate.\nBefore the invasion Colonel North had been working with State Department aides to develop strategies for eliminating death squad activity and holding free elections in El Salvador. After the invasion, Colonel North returned to that task.\nIn the fall of 1983, death squads in El Salvador were committing an average of 800 killings a month and the President's ability to secure funds from Congress for the Salvadoran Government was being damaged.\nAgain, though he did not direct the effort, Colonel North became one of a team of key advisers in a program.\nThe team agreed that as part of the Government's effort, a top United States official had to visit El Salvador. The State Department, in a proposal written by Mr. Motley, asked Vice President Bush, and, according to former members of the Vice President's staff, Mr. Bush agreed.\nBefore Mr. Bush embarked, Colonel North briefed him at length at least once in the White House, a former White House assistant said. Colonel North also went to San Salvador with Mr. Bush on Air Force Two and briefed him again before they landed.\nOne of Colonel North's ideas, to use the F.B.I. to conduct surveillance on death squad leaders in El Salvador and to teach the Salvadorans to conduct their own investigations, was particularly successful, according to National Security Council sources and former officials of the American Embassy in El Salvador. Death squad activity has dropped to almost nothing since.\nThe other crucial program in Central America that occupied Colonel North was helping the Nicaraguan rebels. It was, Colonel North knew, a program vigorously supported by President Reagan, according to former National Security Council staff members.\nColonel North and Mr. Clarridge of the C.I.A., according to the Washington source, worked together on plans to supply Nicaraguan rebels with ammunition, weapons and food. The supply missions, operated by the C.I.A., were flown from the Ilopango air force base in San Salvador starting in the late spring of 1983 and continued until the fall of 1984, when Congress voted to stop aid for the contras.\nIt was during these operations that Colonel North, according to White House sources, began to work independently on Central America and the Middle East.\nIn the spring of 1984, his name was first linked in published reports to potentially illegal Government activity in a New York Times article about Government-sponsored supply missions to Nicaragua and Honduras. ''At a time when Congress wasn't forthcoming to the contras, Ollie was their strongest link in Washington,'' said Mr. Messing of the National Defense Council Foundation.\nColonel North's role in the Iran-contra affair started on Nov. 22 or 23, 1985, according to Congressional testimony by Mr. McFarlane. It was on one of those days that Mr. McFarlane asked Colonel North to help move a shipment of arms to Teheran that had been held up in Israel. Colonel North asked the C.I.A. to help, according to Congressional testimony by William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence.\nColonel North, according to Mr. Casey, told the C.I.A. that the plane in Israel was loaded with oil drilling equipment. The plane was actually filled with antitank missiles.\nBy late 1985, it would have been second nature for Mr. McFarlane to seek Colonel North's assistance.\nIn mid-June that year, Colonel North had been dispatched to the Middle East by Mr. McFarlane to monitor the hijacking of a T.W.A. jet in which 39 Americans had been taken hostage.\nA White House official said Colonel North was working closely with the Delta Force, a counterterrorist military unit. Capturing Hijackers\nThen, in October, Colonel North offered a suggestion to Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, then the deputy national security adviser, for capturing the hijackers of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro.\nColonel North said the United States could intercept the four men over the Mediterranean while they were being flown from Egypt to Tunis and divert the plane to Italy. Admiral Poindexter and Admiral Moreau of the Joint Chiefs of Staff helped the military plan and perform the mission, according to State Department officials. Colonel North coordinated the intelligence, diplomatic and military activity from the crisis management center.\nColonel North also accompanied Mr. McFarlane on trips to Teheran last May, six months after Mr. McFarlane resigned as national security adviser, and again last October. Little else is known about the extent of Colonel North's involvement in the Iran-contra affair.\nOne of the few messages Colonel North was unable to intercept was his own letter of dismissal. Nobody was more surprised thatn Colonel North, said a National Security Council staff member, when Presient Reagan made the announcement. Colonel North had not been previously notified. Later that evening, President Reagan called Colonel North to wish him well and thank him for his service.
515	BEHIND CHINA'S PROTESTS	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDB1F39F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The increasing harshness of official criticism of the Chinese student demonstrations for greater democracy has raised questions about who in the nation's leadership is behind the rising tide of virulence in the state-controlled press. Today, the Communist\nThe increasing harshness of official criticism of the Chinese student demonstrations for greater democracy has raised questions about who in the nation's leadership is behind the rising tide of virulence in the state-controlled press. Today, the Communist\nParty and the Government continued their criticism of the protesters after New Year's demonstrations Thursday that swelled into the largest public protest seen in Beijing since the Democracy Wall period in 1979, when China briefly experienced free expression.\nThe prominent press attacks by some party leaders who have resisted China's economic changes suggest the possibility of a politically tenser period building up to the 13th Communist Party Congress, scheduled in October. The congress is a key meeting at which Chinese leaders can be chosen and policies set. The Prominent Critics\nIn all the denunciations of the students, the only members of China's Communist Party leadership who have been identified are those who are generally regarded as resisting, to a greater or lesser degree, the sweep of economic changes pushed by Deng Xiaoping, the country's senior leader. Indeed, many of the leaders quoted in recent days are usually never quoted in the press except on minor occasions such as meetings with foreign dignitaries.\nSuddenly it is the party hard-liners who are prominently mentioned in Chinese news accounts describing the reaction to the protests.\nOn Sunday, a special group of party leaders, all identified with that wing of the party, used the occasion of a tea party for a well-known storyteller to characterize student calls for democratic freedoms in China as an unhealthy attempt to impose ''all-out Westernization'' on the country and to destroy Communism.\nAlthough repeating their view that the students' supposed embrace of the West is politically corrupt, these party leaders have also vigorously championed the virtues of the Communist Party, the legitimacy of its dictatorship and the role it must play in the life of the country. 'Great, Glorious and Correct'\n''The Chinese Communist Party is a great, glorious and politically correct party that has always retained its revolutionary vigor,'' Wang Zhen, a member of the Politburo and a central figure among the hard-liners, said in remarks quoted by People's Daily, the official party paper, ''The leadership of the Communist Party is not granted by heaven,'' Mr. Wang said, ''but by countless revolutionary martyrs who, wave after wave, shed blood and sacrificed themselves for half a century.''\nMr. Wang's remarks bear tinges of the political exhortations more typical of the hysterical climate of the Cultural Revolution than the sober-minded pragmatism that has been characteristic of public statements by party leaders in the last year.\nBecause of the extremely closed nature of decision making, it is virtually impossible to be sure of the implications of the press campaign and its protagonists. Some Western diplomats argue that a growing rift between the hard-liners in the party and the economic pragmatists led by Mr. Deng is suggested in repeated press attacks on the students by Mr. Wang and by such ideological colleagues as Hu Qiaomu, a member of the Central Committee and the director of the office that is compiling the works of Mao; Peng Zhen, a member of the Politburo, and Chen Yun, a member of the standing committee of the Politburo. An Unassailable Terrain\nBy using the press to attack the students, these diplomats contend, they are carving out an unassailable terrain of ideological legitimacy from which they can begin to slow economic initiatives pushed by Mr. Deng.\nAt the same time, the hard-liners may be able to use this occasion to scuttle any move toward political liberalization, a goal that has been frequently discussed in the press in the last six months. Although the shape of any such changes is vague, it is widely thought that a main goal of political changes would be to separate the party from the Government and finally to place the party under the rule of law and the constitution. Currently, the party is essentially a law unto itself. For the hard-liners, changes of this sort are tantamount to an attack on the party itself.\nToday, People's Daily again denounced any attempts to question the leadership of the party and charged that ''over the past few years, some people in ideological and cultural fields used chances for reform to express all kinds of deviant thinking.''\nBetween now and the time of the party congress, the hard-liners may be able to employ their cloak of political righteousness to rally allies to their cause, stiffen party control over universities and public life and try to hem in Mr. Deng and his associates, according to some diplomats. An Avenue for Deng\nOn the other hand, Mr. Deng may see the hard-liners as an avenue to pursue his own ends. By no means a democrat, Mr. Deng has stressed the importance of national stability if his plans for economic growth are to succeed. Indeed, in 1979, while at first appearing to tolerate a brief explosion of free expression, Mr. Deng crushed the spreading movement when it began to question the primacy of the party.\nBy giving the hard-liners in the party free rein for once, Mr. Deng may paradoxically be seeking to strengthen the party so that he can continue the economic shake-up in a less politically charged atmosphere. In this sense, Mr. Deng is able to remain aloof from the issue of democracy itself and while at the same time avoiding being pulled into the messiness of suppressing the student movement.\nWhat seems clear is that despite the high rhetorical pitch of the hard-liners, the police and university officials have retained an almost casual posture toward the student demonstrations. It is not impossible, some Western diplomats here contend, that this reflects a degree of protection, or even sanction, from some quarters in the party.

Libyan troops have also occupied Faya-Largeau, about 175 miles northwest of Fada, for the last three years.\nThe fighting at Fada appeared to signal the opening of a second front, southeast of Faya-Largeau, in a bid by President Hissen Habre to retake the north alongside former rebels who controlled the area with Libyan backing until breaking with Libya in October.\nTen days ago, a column of Mr. Habre's troops left Ndjamena to join forces with the former rebels, who are loyal to former President Goukouni Oueddei.\nOnly hours before the reports about fighting at Fada, Chad said its troops had recaptured Zouar, a key oasis town in the northwestern Tibesti mountain range, after heavy fighting against Libyan forces that seized it on Sunday from the rebels, their former allies.
517	BATTLE AGAINST DRUNKEN DRIVING SHOULD SHIFT FOCUS, SOME EXPERTS ASSERT	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DA1F39F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: As the police stop tens of thousands of motorists around the country for sobriety checks over the extended New Year's holiday, some experts are arguing that the fight against drunken driving would be more effective if it focused on offenders as alcoholics, not as social drinkers who went a little too far.\nAs the police stop tens of thousands of motorists around the country for sobriety checks over the extended New Year's holiday, some experts are arguing that the fight against drunken driving would be more effective if it focused on offenders as alcoholics, not as social drinkers who went a little too far.\nAccording to these experts, even with the stepped-up enforcement in the current crusade against drunken driving, the chance of getting picked up for being intoxicated is minuscule unless a motorist drives that way habitually. The police and other safety officials estimate that they pick up only 1 in 2,000 drunken drivers.\nOf those who are picked up, the majority show signs of alcohol dependence or alcoholism if they are clinically evaluated, according to several studies.\nIf this is true, the finding would cast doubt on the efficacy of most programs designed for first offenders, which are geared to social drinkers, not alcoholics or others with problem drinking. Programs for those convicted of driving under the influence or drunken driving stress relatively brief classroom instruction on the problems with drinking and driving, perhaps combined with mandatory community service work. Education Programs Popular\nMore than 25 percent of all drivers in fatal crashes are drunk at the time of the accident, according to statistics of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The number of traffic fatalities in which one driver or pedestrian was legally drunk has fallen, but it is still very high, according to the agency, which counted 20,360 in 1982 as against 17,870 in 1985.\nThe response to drunken driving around the nation has varied from raising the drinking age to banning discount drinks at bar ''happy hours,'' but has centered on programs that force first offenders into education programs that stress that alcohol and driving do not mix.\nThe problem, according to some experts, is that those who are caught are not really first offenders.\n''We're wasting our time in America on three-quarters of the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people we arrest,'' said Judge Albert L. Kramer, of the Quincy District Court in Massachusetts, who has made a specialty of the field, in a telephone interview.\nQuincy District Court sent 1,252 people convicted of drunken driving from 1982 to 1985 to a two-day clinical assessment and found that 1,031, or 82 percent, were alcoholics or ''problem drinkers'' and only 221, or 18 percent, were social drinkers.\nCiting Massachusetts probation studies, Judge Kramer said that 44.8 percent of the ''first offenders'' in that state had prior criminal records for offenses likely to be alcohol-related, such as disorderly conduct, larceny and assault and battery. 'Threats to Safety'\n''Drunk drivers are not mere social drinkers who happen to over-indulge,'' he wrote in a paper published recently in the Alcohol Treatment Quarterly. ''They are largely alcoholics, seriously addicted, and represent threats to the public safety.''\nStudies in other states have also found a high proportion of alcoholism or problem drinking among those stopped for drunken driving.\nAlcoholism is indicated immediately in many of those stopped, according to Judge Kramer and others, because of the very high blood alcohol levels measured. While the legal limit in most states is .10 percent, the average for those arrested is from .18 to .20, according to Alfred Crancer Jr., a program manager in the San Francisco regional office of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. He put the proportion of those arrested who have a ''moderate to serious'' drinking problem at 90 percent.\nTo have .20 alcohol content in the blood, a 160-pound person would have to consumer 11 drinks of 80-proof liquor over a one-hour period on an empty stomach, Mr. Crancer said in a paper, ''The Myth of the Social Drinker-D.U.I. Driver,'' presented last April at the American Medical Society on Alcoholism and Other Drug Dependencies and the Research Society on Alcoholism. To reach .10, the 160-pound person would have to consume six drinks the same way.\nSix drinks in an hour is far in excess of typical consumption, according to a variety of studies. At the National Council on Alcoholism, the oldest voluntary agency in the field, Christine B. Lubinski, a spokesman, said that at that level of drinking, ''The only people who wouldn't be unconscious, vomiting in the bathroom or looking for a car blearily, are alcoholics.''\nExperts also agree that the kind of education program that might convince social drinkers to be more careful would not affect the behavior of alcoholics. At St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center, a prominent alcoholism treatment facility in Minneapolis, for example, Dr. George A. Mann, the medical director, asked what effect the typical first-offender program would have on the behavior of an alcoholic, responded, ''I would say, zero.''\n''If you want to look at a program that really gets to the bottom of the problem, you have to separate out the people who are there because they have abused alcohol on that occasion, and those who are diagnosable alcoholics,'' Dr. Mann said. He said that of those stopped for the first time for drunken driving, about 40 percent are probably alcoholics but an equally high proportion might be ''alcohol abusers'' or ''problem drinkers,'' or people who experience ''harmful or destructive consequences'' of drinking.\nJudge Kramer said: ''Alcoholism blurs any recognition of the harm they are doing or any fear of penalty.''\nAccording to Mr. Crancer: ''These people know when they're sober that they should not drive drunk. There's not a drunk in the U.S. of A. who doesn't know it's illegal, immoral, unethical, stupid and expensive. But when they start drinking, if they have an alcohol problem, that goes out the window.''\nTreatment of alcoholism can be more effective than simple license revocation, according to Judge Kramer and others, because lack of a license does not keep people from driving. It is also, they argue, a better use of the tremendous effort required of the police and judicial system to bring a driver in for sentencing. To catch a single intoxicated driver at a highway checkpoint, for example, the police may have to stop 150 cars. Some Experts Disagree\nSome experts said, however, that they could not agree that the bulk of the drunken driving problem is caused by a relatively small number of drinkers.\n''These are people that have gone out and drank and are not well versed in their consumption level of alcohol,'' said Lieut. Richard McGee, commander of the traffic division of the Maryland State Police. ''Most of these people are one-time shots.''\nFor most of them, he said, one arrest is sufficient. ''When they get tagged the first time,'' he said, ''they say 'Hey, we're done with it.'''\nBut Lieutenant McGee added that it might take months or years of drunken driving to be arrested.\nJohn A. Volpe, a former United States Secretary of Transportation who was later the chairman of a Presidential commission on drunken driving, said, ''I don't think you can actually say that well, he's a social drinker and just got carried away that night, or that he's habitual drunk, arrested two, three, five or a dozen times.''\nBecause of plea bargains for previous offenses, people stopped for drunken driving might have records that show only minor violations, so that when they are brought before judges, according to Mr. Volpe, ''It's like he's not appearing for the eighth time, but he's appearing as a first-time offender. So naturally the judge is more lenient.'' Proper sentencing is important, he said, but ''throwing a guy in jail, even on a first offense, truly a first offense, I don't think is a good idea.''\nOther interested groups, such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving, do not list treatment as their top priority. 'Pay for That Crime'\n''We at M.A.D.D. feel that if a person who drinks and drives, and is an alcoholic, you're looking at two different problems,'' said Norma Phillips, the president. ''This man or woman has broken the law, and needs to pay for that crime.''\nMrs. Phillips said that her group did not oppose providing rehabilitation to alcoholics who drive drunk, but she said, ''The swift and sure punishment of drunk driving will deter the crime.'' She said that of the more than 1.5 million arrests last year for drunken driving, about 30 percent were repeat offenders, and she asserted that better sentencing could reduce that number.\nFrom a different perspective, groups dealing with alcoholics also want immproved sentencing procedures. ''People in this field have known for years that D.U.I. is one of the best opportunities for intervention with an alcoholic that there is,'' said Ms. Lubinski.\nMany in the field believe that the solution to the problem is a further change in social attitudes toward drinking that can lead to drunken driving. Some favor expansion of the ''designated driver'' program, widely used in Scandinavia, in which one person in a group agrees not to drink.\nBut that, too, would require a change in society's attitude toward drinking. According to George A. Hacker, director for Alcohol Policies of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington: ''Being a designated driver is like being a pariah. You're the one sentenced to being the dull, staid character for the night. What a drag.''\nHe added, ''What we should really be doing is addressing how alcohol is perceived.''

519	STATE OFFICIAL RESIGNS AFTER OUTCRY OVER CITY MILK SALES RULING	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D91F39F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The Cuomo administration announced today that its Agriculture Commissioner had resigned. It said his ruling three weeks ago not to allow more milk distributors to operate throughout New York City had drawn such an outcry that he could no longer serve as an effective advocate for Governor Cuomo's policies.\nThe Cuomo administration announced today that its Agriculture Commissioner had resigned. It said his ruling three weeks ago not to allow more milk distributors to operate throughout New York City had drawn such an outcry that he could no longer serve as an effective advocate for Governor Cuomo's policies.\nThe formal announcement of the departure of the Commissioner, Joseph Gerace, was structured to make it appear as though he had left voluntarily and included the release of a two-page letter from the Governor, who wrote to Mr. Gerace that he accepted his resignation ''with considerable regret.''\nBut privately, Cuomo aides acknowledged that they had made clear to the Commissioner that it would be better for the administration if he resigned. Refusal to Grant Citywide License\nOn Dec. 11, in a decision that was front-page news around the state, Mr. Gerace refused to grant a license to a New Jersey dairy to sell milk throughout New York City. Currently, only five dairies, all in New York State, hold such a license. Mr. Gerace said that granting the license to Farmland Dairy of Wallington, N.J., would have brought ''destructive competition.'' Farmland has won the right to distribute milk on Staten Island.\nConsumer groups were outraged, arguing that granting a citywide license to a sixth dairy would have led to healthy competition and lowered milk prices. They called on the Governor to remove the Commissioner, and their cause was picked up in editorials throughout the state.\nIn a three-page letter to the Governor dated Dec. 31, Mr. Gerace referred to the ''torrent'' of commentary about his decision, adding, ''A new commissioner would be free to press aggressively for your program legislation without the obvious impairment of repeatedly defending decisions made under the existing statutory limitations.''\nMr. Cuomo, in a letter dated today that began ''Dear Joe,'' responded, ''It is unfortunate, but I can understand your assessment that the current situation may have precluded your ability to present our common position as effectively as possible in the months ahead.''\nMr. Gerace, a 59-year-old lawyer and former Chautauqua County Executive who has been Agriculture Commissioner since May 1983, will assume a post in the administration as director of the recently created Office of Rural Affairs. His nomination to the post, the salary of which has yet to be set, requires State Senate confirmation. New Post to Aid Rural Areas\nThe office was created to protect the interests of rural areas, directing them to aid programs and encouraging economic development.\nMr. Gerace said in an interview that the new job was ''a dream come true'' and that, as the resident of a rural area, he hoped to be a ''voice'' for rural interests.\nOn Dec. 12, a day after the dairy ruling, the Governor was asked at a news conference if he would dismiss the Commissioner. ''He's still here, isn't he?'' Mr. Cuomo said. A 'Quasi-Judicial' Decision\nThe Governor said at the time that he would have preferred a ruling opening up competition among milk distributors in New York City. But he said that the decision was a ''quasi-judicial'' one and that he assumed Mr. Gerace had weighed testimony and evidence and had based his ruling on the requirements of the law regulating the milk industry.\nSince then, however, pressure for hisouster has mounted. Last week, at a news conference at City Hall in New York, Daniel Oliver, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said Mr. Gerace had won his ''national consumer fleece award'' for the ruling, which Mr. Oliver said upheld ''an anti-consumer monopoly.''\nCurrent state law forbids the granting by the Agriculture Commissioner of a license that would lead to ''destructive competition,'' but it does not define the term.\nOver the last two years, Mr. Cuomo has proposed changes in the law that would liberally define the term and allow more milk distributors into the city. But they have been blocked by upstate Republicans whose constituents include farmers who sell to the five dairies that sell in all five boroughs of the New York City market.\nAdministration officials said the Governor had not decided on a replacement for Mr. Gerace in the $79,218-a-year post, formally called Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets.\nThe executive director of the state Consumer Protection Board, Richard M. Kessel, said he would like the new Commissioner to press for changes in the law. But he said that in the meantime, he would like him to rehear the Farmland case and grant it the license. Mr. Kessel has argued that the license could be granted under the existing statute and that Mr. Gerace was too strict in his interpretation of it.\nIt was not clear, however, if that would happen. Administration officials said tonight that they were inclined to ask the new Commissioner to concentrate on lobbying for the Governor's proposed changes in the law and to let the Farmland decision stand for now, if only to increase pressure on the Legislature to enact the changes.\nThe Commissioner said he wanted to concentrate on looking ahead. He referred, however, to ''the drum beat of media commentary'' about his decision not to grant the citywide license and added that milk distributors were making far less profit than was generally believed and that news organizations had ''failed to find out what the facts really are.''\nNew York State's milk-licensing procedures have been under investigation since November by the State Investigation Commission, which has called Mr. Gerace as a witness.

The Devils followed their recent habit of allowing too many goals in the opening period again tonight, spotting the Boston Bruins a 5-0 lead en route to a 7-2 loss at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.\n''We're looking for answers to the problem we have in the first period,'' said Coach Doug Carpenter, who held a 20-minute meeting with his players after the game. ''We spoke about our situation, and the biggest question I have is why get behind in the first period.''\nRick Middleton led the Bruins with two goals, with Lyndon Byers, Nevin Markwart, Reed Larson, Greg Johnston and Charlie Simmer getting a goal each to help Boston end a five-game losing streak. Chevrier Is Replaced\nThe Bruins took 42 shots against Alain Chevrier, who allowed 5 goals on 21 shots in 24 minutes 53 seconds of action. Kirk McLean replaced him and allowed 2 goals on 21 shots.\nAndy Brickley and Mark Johnson scored for the Devils, who are without a victory in six games (0-5-1). The Devils took a total of 23 shots, but only 4 in the last period, against Bill Ranford.\n''We realize we obviously have a problem in the first 20 minutes,'' said Kirk Muller of the Devils. ''We have to resolve the fact that we've been coming out flat.''\nIn two losses to the Rangers in the last two weeks, the Devils spotted them leads of 4-0 and 3-0 early in the game. They also allowed Washington a 3-0 lead on Dec. 19, but they rallied for 6-4 victory in that game.\nTonight, they yielded four goals in the first period, with the first two coming 43 seconds apart, as Byers opened the scoring at 6:42 and Middleton getting his first goal of the night at 7:25. The goal by Byers appeared to go in off Steve Richmond, a Devils defenseman.\nMarkwart's goal that gave the Bruins a 3-0 lead with 2:56 left in the period was well constructed on the right by Ray Bourque, who avoided a Devil or two on the right and passed diagonally to Markwart, who entered the slot from the left side and beat Chevrier from the goalie's right side.\nThe Bruins then capitalized on their third manpower advantage of the night, when Middleton got the last goal of the period with six seconds left with a backhander to the short side from the bottom of the left circle. Lead Grows to 5-0\nLarson's eighth of the season, which gave the visitors a 5-0 lead, also came on the power play, 4 minutes 53 seconds into the middle period, when he beat Chevrier between the legs from close range. It was the last play in the game for Chevrier.\nThe Devils still did not appear to come out of their lethargy for another six minutes or so. They got their first goal at 11:43 of the second period, when Brickley's shot from the slot ricocheted off the right post and into the net.\n''We talked about our problem in the first priod,'' Mel Bridgman, the captain of the Devils, said about the meeting after the game, ''and what each player individually is supposed to do.''\nThe Devils picked up the momentum after Brickley's fifth of the season and scored again at 15:03 of the period, when Johnson beat Ranford over the glove. They had two chances to come closer, but their momentum was lost when they had to kill a penalty with three minutes left in the period.\nThe last period also turned dout to be a disaster for the Devils as they took only four shots on goal. The Bruins had 11 and got goals from Johnson and Simmer to secure their first victory in six games (1-5-0).

523	STORM AND TIDES RAKE EAST COAST, LEAVING 9 DEAD	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D71F39F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A classic northeaster, combined with tides raised unusually high by a rare celestial configuration, sent New Englanders scurrying inland yesterday afternoon after the storm left nine people dead and caused at least $14 million in damage along the southeastern coast of the United States.\nA classic northeaster, combined with tides raised unusually high by a rare celestial configuration, sent New Englanders scurrying inland yesterday afternoon after the storm left nine people dead and caused at least $14 million in damage along the southeastern coast of the United States.\nAs it swept through the New York metropolitan area, the storm and tides swamped many major roads, washed away a house in the Hamptons and stranded passengers on the Staten Island ferry for an hour. City transportation workers had to install a special bridge to reach the ferry, which was riding high in the water, well above the terminal's gangway. Evacuation Is Counseled\nIn New Hampshire and Maine, the National Weather Service urged seaside residents to ''complete all safety precautions and evacuate to higher ground inland as soon as possible,'' but the civil defense authorities said only a dozen did so briefly in each of those states.\nIn New Hampshire, two shelters were opened, but no one occupied them. Fewer than 10 people left their homes but returned by 3 P.M.\nMaine was fortunate that high tides did not coincide with the peak of the storm, which was expected to dump from 10 to 14 inches of snow by this morning.\nDriving was reported as hazardous, and in southern Maine, where as much as nine inches of snow fell in the day, officials closed the Maine Turnpike to commercial traffic.\nThe weather service called the storm ''the most vicious'' since a February 1978 blizzard paralyzed Boston with 27 inches of snow, caused 29 deaths, destroyed 339 houses and inflicted $300 million property damage. ''This is a classic northeaster, a real East Coast bomb,'' said Mel Goldstein, director of the Weather Center at Western Connecticut State University.\nIn Scituate, Mass., Dick LaCross, who lives near the beach, said: ''I just tied up my boats and put the cat in the attic. There's not much more you can do.'' Many residents in Massachusetts coastal towns voluntarily evacuated their homes after receiving warnings from local officials and the police in the morning. The Scituate police said the tide was about 6 feet above normal high tide. Hundreds Trapped\nIn Marshfield, Mass., the tides, whipped by winds of up to 60 miles an hour, broke through a sea wall at about noon and trapped hundreds of people. Rescuers used boats and trucks to reach some of the people, according to Daniel McGonagle, the civil defense director of Marshfield, a seaside suburb 35 miles southeast of Boston.\nMr. McGonagle said people had scrambled onto the roofs of their homes, cars or businesses. There were no reports of deaths or injuries in the Boston area.\nIn Minot, a seaside community 20 miles southeast of Boston, waves smashed over an eight-foot-high sea wall and flooded streets and houses. One resident told of being battered about by a large wave as he drove behind the sea wall. Through the windshield of the car, he watched as the water rolled along the top of the wall for 50 feet, came crashing down to pick up the car and spin it like a surfboard into a telephone pole. Whole Town Under Water\nIn Hull, just south of Boston, water up to five feet deep cut off two peninsulas crowded with homes and left much of the town flooded. ''The whole town, all the low-lying areas, are under water,'' said Kay Berberick, a town official.\n''A lot of people who were here this morning are taking the chance now to get out of town with their families,'' said Claudette Fitzsimmons, a Selectman in Hull.\nIn Boston, the unusually high tide had workers at the Marriott Long Wharf Hotel, which overlooks the harbor, filling sandbags to block doors. Next door, on the wharf, the water reached the windows of the Chart House restaurant and cars in the restaurant's parking lot were swamped. Most offices in Boston were closed by noon, with the streets clear of the usual traffic jams.\nAt the height of the storm, from noon to 1 P.M., 350 people were evacuated from coastal towns south of Boston, but by late evening most had returned to their homes, according to a spokesman for the Massachusetts Civil Defense Agency.\nThe storm was blamed for the deaths of four people in traffic accidents in North Carolina, as well as two in Virginia, which was also hit by coastal flooding, heavy rain and up to 5 inches of snow in some western areas of that state. Two people were also killed in Vermont and one in Massachusetts in traffic accidents related to the storm. Factors in High Tides\nTides along the Eastern Coast were two to three feet above normal because of a rare combination of factors involving alignment and proxmity of the Sun, Moon and Earth that has occurred only three times since 1912, the weather service said. Twice a month the Earth, Moon and Sun become aligned in what is known as syzygy. At full moon, the Moon is opposite from the Sun and at new moon it is toward the sun. What makes the current situation rare is that at the new moon Tuesday, both the Sun and Moon were relatively close to the Earth.\nAlong South Carolina's Grand Strand, a 50-mile strip of resort towns, cottages and condominium developments on the state's northeastern edge, local officials estimated that damages were ''in the millions.''\nIn the Garden City area alone,the low-lying southern edge of the Grand Strand, damage to oceanfront property was estimated from $5 million to $8 million, according to the Horry County Emergency Preparedness Director, Tommy Harrison. A causeway to Garden City, much of which is separated from the mainland by a saltwater marsh, was completely under water at the high point of the tide, Mr. Harrison said. ''Everything was impassable,'' he said. At Long Beach, N.C., where surging waves damaged at least 50 homes, the loss was placed at about $6 million. Roads to Atlantic City Closed\nOn the island gambling resort of Atlantic City, N.J., waves pushed into downtown neighborhoods at high tide. ''Every road into Atlantic City is closed,'' said Jim Masland, director of emergency management for the city. Just to the west, Egg Harbor Township authorities said about 50 people from three motels, a detoxification center and homes took shelter at a high school until the waters subsided.\nIn New York, Sam Schwartz, a spokesman for the city Department of Transportation, said: ''We have tides at our ferry terminal at the Battery that we have not seen in almost 20 years. It was so high that we couldn't discharge passengers from the 10 A.M. ferry until 11 o'clock. And we had to use a portable gangway.'' Portable Gangway to Ferry\nMr. Schwartz said that the bridge at the terminal usually can be raised or lowered to reach the ferry. ''We raised the bridge to its highest point and we lowered the ferry by using maximum ballast,'' he said. ''Even with that, we had more than a foot distance. Rather than risk an accident, we brought the ferry back out into the water until the portable gangway could be installed.''\nMr. Schwartz said that sections of many major roads in the city were flooded. ''The entire Belt Parkway system, which includes the Cross Island Parkway, had lots of flooding throuhgout the system,'' he said. ''The F.D.R. Drive, where it runs under Gracie Mansion, was flooded.'' Mr. Schwartz said the ''trench area'' of the Cross Bronx Expressway, where the road cuts below street-level near Tremont Avenue, also was inundated. Parkways Are Affected\nOther roads that were affected, he said, included sections of the Grand Central Parkway, the Interborough Parkway in the vicinity of Myrtle Avenue and the Long Island Expressway. Mr. Schwartz said that his office had received no reports of major accidents.\nThe storm also flooded a section of the Long Island Rail Road, knocking out service on the Long Beach branch for several hours. Railroad officials said that power on the line had to be shut off at about 10 A.M. because of flooding near the Island Park Station. Partial service was restored at 2 P.M. and by 5 P.M. the railroad had the use of both tracks, but delays continued through the evening. While the line was closed, passengers were shuttled on buses between Long Beach and Valley Stream.\nCliff Crowley, the meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service office in New York City, said he had received a report that a summer house on Dune Road in Westhampton had been washed away, ''and a couple of foundations there were weakened.''\n''Every time there's a major storm,'' he added, ''that's a very vulnerable area.'' In the Rockaways, in Queens, he said, ''they had to evacuate 14 people because of the flooding.'' Storm Center Moving\nMr. Crowley said that as of 4 P.M. yesterday, the center of the storm had moved off the coast of Maine and ''is moving northeastward away from us.'' He added: ''It looks like most of the snow in the metropolitan area fell over New Jersey and Westchester and Rockland County, about three to four inches. We had about a half an inch of snow over Long Island and in the city.'' Combined with the rain, he said, the city received between 1 and 1 1/2 inches of precipitation.\nRelief was expected today, Mr. Crowley said: ''It looks like much better weather for Saturday - variable cloudiness and highs in the upper 30's. And it looks like even better weather for Sunday, sunny, high 35 to 40.\nAsked how he thought the city had fared through the storm, Mr. Schwartz, the transportation department spokesman, said, ''It's the first time I can recall that we can blame the Sun and the Moon for gridlock.''

525	REAGAN BACK IN CAPITAL IN UPBEAT MOOD FOR 1987	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D61F39F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: President Reagan, predicting that the new year would be ''better than '86,'' returned to Washington from California today to confront an array of personal and political problems.\nPresident Reagan, predicting that the new year would be ''better than '86,'' returned to Washington from California today to confront an array of personal and political problems.\nAfter a New Year's holiday in relative isolation near Palm Springs at the estate of Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher and former Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Reagan faces what aides concede is the most strained and difficult period of his Presidency.\nBut Mr. Reagan seemed in an upbeat mood this morning as he boarded Air Force One at sun-drenched Palm Springs Airport, and a reporter shouted, ''What will 1987 be like?''\n''Great,'' said Nancy Reagan, the President's wife.\n''Better than '86,'' Mr. Reagan said when the question was repeated. Reagan Faces Hospitalization\nBefore returning to work at the Oval Office, Mr. Reagan faces hospitalization for prostate surgery as well as a colonoscopic examination 18 months after surgery for colon cancer.\nMr. Reagan, 75 years old, will enter the Bethesda Naval Hospital on Sunday for the colonoscopic examination. On Monday, Mr. Reagan is scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure to relieve discomfort caused by an enlarged prostate gland. The President is expected to remain in the hospital until the middle of next week.\nIn an interview tonight at halftime of the Fiesta Bowl, Mr. Reagan made light of his upcoming surgery. ''As to your good wishes,'' Mr. Reagan told the NBC announcer Bob Costas, ''really what I'm going in for is kind of a breeze. I've been there before, so don't waste any sympathy.''\nIn the meantime, the 100th Congress will be sworn in on Tuesday, the first time in Mr. Reagan's Presidency that he will face a Senate and House controlled by the Democrats.\nWhat dominates Mr. Reagan's Presidency, however, as he enters the final two years in the White House, remains the Iran arms scandal. Privately, White House officials express concern that the investigations of the clandestine diversion of millions of dollars to rebels fighting the Nicaraguan Government, from money gained by the sale of arms to Iran, will dominate White House attention and dimimish Mr. Reagan's efforts in the next two years, if not crippling them. Mr. Reagan is scheduled to outline his program in the State of the Union Message Jan. 27.\nThe diversion of funds is being investigated by a special prosecutor as well as Congressional panels.\nMr. Reagan has already appointed David M. Abshire, former Ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to a special job that handles all issues within the White House related to Iran. But aides to Mr. Reagan have said that it would be ''unrealistic'' to assume that the Abshire appointment would somehow blunt the attention paid to the Iran arms issue within the White House and enable Mr. Reagan to avoid the issue.\nBeyond this, White House officials are plainly concerned that the Iran issue is only one of several factors that leaves Mr. Reagan in a seriously weakened position and threatens the prospect for a productive legislative agenda.\nThese factors include Mr. Reagan's fall in popularity, as reflected in public opinion polls, as well as Democratic control of Congress and what officials predict will be the inability of the White House to keep Republican legislators in line as candidates prepare for the 1986 elections.\nMr. Reagan's new budget is expected to bring broad criticism on Capitol Hill. According to a report today in The New York Times report, Mr. Reagan will propose an overall budget of $1,024.3 billion for the fiscal year of 1988, with a deficit of $107.8 billion.\nThe budget proposes $1.8 trillion in military spending over the next five years, but would reduce farm aid by more than half and limit the growth of numerous domestic programs over the same period. The overall military budget would increase by about $20 billion a year for each of the next five years.\nOn the way back to Washington, Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said that the new budget ''will be designed to continue the President's program of economic growth and to preserve our national security buildup.'' 'Push for Free Market'\nMr. Speakes said that the new budget's military proposals were ''designed to encourage the Soviets to bargain seriously so we can be successful in arms reduction.''\nOn the domestic side, Mr. Speakes said the budget ''will propose an approach to farm programs that will push for a free market, encourage production, exporting and opening up new markets.'' He said the budget would seek to reduce ''heavy and ineffective expenditure on farm programs.''\nMr. Reagan also faces some potentially delicate problems. One is the uncertain condition of William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, who recently underwent surgery for a cancerous tumor on his brain. Mr. Speakes insisted that Mr. Reagan had no plans to replace Mr. Casey.\nThe White House spokesman has also said that Mr. Reagan has no plans to replace his chief of staff, Donald T. Regan, because of the Iran arms issue. Mr. Regan spent the New Year in Florida.
526	ISSUE OF SAFETY OF HOTELS RAISING BROAD CONCERN	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DF1638F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The question of the safety of guests in Puerto Rican hotels has emerged from the ashes of the New Year's Eve fire that killed more than 90 people here at the Dupont Plaza Hotel.\nThe question of the safety of guests in Puerto Rican hotels has emerged from the ashes of the New Year's Eve fire that killed more than 90 people here at the Dupont Plaza Hotel.\nOfficials of the Puerto Rican Hotel and Tourism Association said today that the fire was an isolated case and should not deter tourists from visiting the island. They said that until this week member hotels had an outstanding safety record and no one died in a hotel fire in recent memory.\nClearly concerned that the fire would harm the tourism industry, the association officials said they doubted that additional safety features would save lives.\nThe commonwealth does not require sprinkler systems in hotels, and the Dupont Plaza had sprinklers installed only in the basement kitchen, boiler room and main linen supply room, Bruce Shulman, director of the hotel, said today. Many hotels install sprinklers in locations considered vulnerable to the outbreak of fire, such as kitchens and storage rooms. Impact Too Early to Tell\nThere was little evidence that the fire dealt the fragile Puerto Rican tourist economy a serious blow. But everyone seems to agree that it may be too early, in this holiday week, for a reaction to be accurately measured.\n''So far, we have not experienced any cancellations,'' said Nicholas Michael, vice president of marketing and sales for GWV International, a New York wholesale travel concern. ''But today's a slow business day so I'm not too sure if it's a good time to judge. What happens next week remains to be seen.''\nGov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, who says in the aftermath of the disaster Wednesday that he will have the government study fire safety measure revisions, added that the evidence indicated that the existence of a complete sprinkler system at the hotel would have had little impact on the death toll.\nMost of the victims died on lower levels of the 22-story structure as explosions sent a fireball and smoke through the casino, discotheque and lobby. Scores were trapped in the upper floor rooms by the smoke. Search for Signs of Arson\nInvestigators are searching for signs of arson and any evidence that bombs were planted. They were also seeking links between the fire and the labor strife at the hotel as a strike deadline neared.\n''The Dupont Plaza tragedy is an isolated case and has nothing to do with the other hotels that have no labor troubles,'' said Dieter Huckestein, Caribbean director of Hilton International, who is general manager of the Caribe Hilton in San Juan.\n''I've worked in hotels in Cyprus and Israel and far worse trouble did not stop tourism,'' he observed. ''No one should have any trepidation in their minds about coming to Puerto Rico at this time.''\nThe Caribe Hilton, the island's largest hotel, with 640 rooms, recently installed a sprinkler system in its tower wing and plans to install sprinklers throughout the rest of the hotel, Mr. Huckestein said.\nSan Juan, with a million inhabitants, has fewer major fires than does a mainland city of its size, officials reported. Homes and buildings do not require heating systems, fireplaces are virtually unknown, and the home heating appliances that represent potential fire hazards are not necessary. Construction in Puerto Rico\nResidential housing tends to be constructed with nonflammable building materials like concrete blocks. Most are one-story open structures in which escape from fire is easy, and there is less danger of suffocation by smoke.\nHotels that followed similar low-level, open styles of architecture were also considered to be less of a threat from fire.\nHigh-rise modern structures such as the Dupont Plaza represent a different problem, officials pointed out. Once a fire spreads quickly in such a building and cuts off ground-level exits, guests trapped in the higher floors are placed at much greater peril. Nevertheless, the hotel had a feature that many similar structures do not have. All the outside rooms have small balconies. The trapped guests were able to survive for hours on these balconies.\nHad the balconies not been part of the design, there is no telling how many others might have perished as the choking smoke drifted up, fire workers pointed out.\nA new generation of office buildings have risen in the Hato Rey financial section of the city that are copies of the modern glass buildings without windows in most American cities. These buildings have caused concern because the national fire department that protects the island's 3.3 million residents is considered to have inadequate equipment and to be undertrained in fighting blazes in tall buildings.\nManagers of first-rate hotels cite self-imposed reviews of safety systems and procedures as the best defense against fires. Some conduct regular drills with fire department personnel. But there is a sense that government inspection of fire safety features of hotels and office buildings is often lax and that violations go unreported.\nBy law, hotel casinos must have two exits. But, unlike New York City, there is no regulation that requires the doors to open outward. The rear door in the Dupont Plaza casino, where many of the fire victims were trapped, opened inward. That, investigators said, may have added to the toll as panicking victims crushed against the door in their flight from the smoke and fire.

''And we lost to a little better team.''\n''We tried hard, but were outquicked,'' Bo Schembechler said today, a day after his Michigan team squandered a 15-3 lead and was beaten by Arizona State, 22-15, in the 73d Rose Bowl. ''And we lost to a little better team.''\nSchembechler, the Wolverines' coach, who suffered his seventh loss in eight Rose Bowl games, said: ''You can toss Miami, Oklahoma and Arizona State in a hat and they're all about the same. They are good at football on both sides of the ball. Everyone knows how good Oklahoma is. Everyone underestimates Miami's defense, and Arizona State, well, you saw out there how they beat us.''\nSchembechler, who did not mention Penn State in his observation but has always had a high regard for the Nittany Lions, made his assessment several hours before Penn State defeated Miami, 14-10, in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship. He said it the morning after Oklahoma's thrashing of Arkansas, 42-8, in the Orange Bowl. Oklahoma Is Awesome\nOklahoma finished its 11-1 season with a powerful performance on both defense and offense and an excellent effort by Dante Jones, the man who replaced Brian Bosworth at linebacker.\nBosworth had been disqualified from the Orange Bowl game after testing positive for anabolic steroids. Bosworth, a fourth-year junior, had earned all-America honors and was considered by some as the nation's best linebacker. But the Sooners hardly missed him as Jones led the Sooners with nine tackles while Oklahoma stopped the Razorbacks' wishbone cold. Arkansas' only score came in the game's final 20 seconds.\nSpeaking of how Jones did so well for Oklahoma, Schembechler said: ''See, there you are. That's how talented they are. They have the football players, and ask anybody who played them if they want to play Oklahoma again.''\nThe Sooners entered the Orange Bowl ranked No. 1 in the nation by The New York Times computer, but ranked third by both news-agency polls. They have lost only two games in the last two years, both to Miami. Nebraska Has No Trouble\nNebraska, runner-up to Oklahoma in the Big Eight Conference, entered the Sugar Bowl with a slight chip on its shoulder and took it out on Louisiana State, 30-15. Coach Bill Arnsparger therefore went out a loser at L.S.U. He is leaving for the job as athletic director at the University of Florida.\nAnother departing coach, Ted Tollner of Southern California, also went out a loser as the Trojans' offense was helpless against Auburn's defenses in the Florida Citrus Bowl. The Tigers of the Southeastern Conference won, 16-7. Tollner's dismissal was announced after his team lost to Notre Dame and U.C.L.A., but he was allowed to coach through the bowl game.\nA few hours before Michigan began losing its grip on a 12-point lead in the Rose Bowl, the other co-champion of the Big Ten Conference, Ohio State, whipped Texas A&M, 28-12, in the Cotton Bowl. The Buckeyes' defense did it as the Aggies' often superb quarterback, Kevin Murray, was intercepted five times.\nChris Spielman, another of the year's all-America linebackers, made two of those interceptions and ran one of them back 24 yards for a touchdown.\nNone of the five New Year's Day bowl games bore on the final No. 1 team ranking. But there were some excellent individual efforts.\nJeff Van Raaphorst, the most valuable player at the Rose Bowl, threw two touchdown passes to Bruce Hill as he brought Arizona State back in the Sun Devils' first Rose Bowl appearance. Holieway Scores Twice\nBesides Jones's defensive performance for Oklahoma as a fill-in for Bosworth, Jamelle Holieway turned in a fine effort as Oklahoma's wishbone quarterback. Holieway scored two touchdowns and led his team on a rampage of 413 yards. Spencer Tillman ran for two touchdowns, including a 77-yard burst for the first touchdown.\nBrent Fullwood had 152 yards rushing and a touchdown in Auburn's victory over Southern California.\nBut none of Thursday's winning teams could lay claim to No. 1, even though Holieway said after Oklahoma's lopsided victory, ''We have the best defense in the nation, and if we had played like we did tonight we'd have beaten Miami.''

530	ACTOR IS STABBED IN CHEST DURING TOWN HALL SHOW	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D71638F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: As 1,200 theatergoers watched in horror, a man armed with a dagger rushed the stage of the Town Hall theater in Manhattan Thursday night, bowed before the star of a benefit variety show and then stabbed him in the chest.\nAs 1,200 theatergoers watched in horror, a man armed with a dagger rushed the stage of the Town Hall theater in Manhattan Thursday night, bowed before the star of a benefit variety show and then stabbed him in the chest.\nThe performer, Chiang Kuang-Chao, 52 years old, who was a popular comedian in Taiwan and Hong Kong before he moved to Monterrey Park, Calif., was in fair condition at St. Clare's Hospital last night.\n''Mr. Chiang is the Chinese Bob Hope,'' said Mary Li, who was in the audience and witnessed the stabbing. Speculation on Motive\nThe show was sponsored by the Asian-American Cultural Foundation, whose parent group, the Asian-American Republican National Federation, raises money for Republican political candidates.\nThe police did not know of a motive for the attack, but members of the Chinese-American community said it might have stemmed from a dispute between rival Chinese-American businessmen.\nThe police identified the attacker as Rene Cordova, 41, of 90 Lafayette Street in Manhattan, which is the McAuley Water Street Mission, a privately sponsored shelter. An employee of the shelter confirmed last night that Mr. Cordova had been staying there until his arrest.\nAccording to two witnesses and the police, the attack occurred about 10:30 P.M., near the end of a 2 1/2-hour show of songs and jokes in Chinese.\nAs the full cast of 14 was about to sing the finale, ''Tomorrow Will Be Even Better,'' the attacker appeared from the left side of the theater and climbed the four steps to the stage, according to the witnesses, Mrs. Li and her husband, Yung Li, a columnist for The World Journal, a Chinese-language newspaper based in Flushing, Queens.\n''We had no idea what he was trying to do,'' Mrs. Li said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''On the stage, he walked slowly, staggering slightly. He came up to the performers, bowed before Mr. Chiang, then all of sudden punched Mr. Chiang once with his right fist.''\nMr. and Mrs. Li said Mr. Chiang, dressed in a black tuxedo for the finale, reeled back from the blow, then fled backstage with the other performers.\n''It was then we realized he wasn't punching Mr. Chiang but that he had a knife in his hand,'' said Mr. Li, who was sitting first row center in the balcony.\nHorrified stagehands and dozens of the theatergoers chased Mr. Cordova, seizing him in an alley adjacent to the theater, and holding him there until the police arrived. 'Really Bad Luck'\nMr. Li, a long-time police reporter, said he interviewed Mr. Chiang backstage as he waited for an ambulance. ''I asked him, 'Did you know that guy?' '' Mr. Li said. ''He said, 'No, I don't know that guy. I don't know why he wanted to kill me. It's really bad luck.' ''\nMr. Chiang suffered stab wounds to the diaphragm and liver, and underwent surgery early yesterday, according to a spokesman for St. Clare's Hospital, Linda Greenough.\nMr. Cordova was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where doctors gave him a preliminary psychiatric evaluation. Mr. Cordova was to be arraigned last night at Manhattan Criminal Court at 100 Centre Street.\nThe associate director of Town Hall, Phoebe Planick, said, ''Nothing like this has ever happened here.'' 'I've Never Heard of Him'\nThe political federation that sponsored the show is headed by Ben John Chen, a real-estate developer in Chinatown. Spokesmen at the federation's offices at 221 Centre Street declined to comment on the incident yesterday.\nRepublican and Conservative officials played down the significance of Mr. Chen's organization as a vehicle in party politics.\n''I've never heard of him and I've never heard the Senator speak of him,'' said Mort Lawrence, the chief of staff to State Senator Roy M. Goodman, chairman of the Republican Party in New York County.\n''I've never known his organization to state a position on an issue,'' said Howard Lim Jr., chairman of the Conservative Party in New York County. ''The organization allows Mr. Chen to print up letterhead stationery, business cards and run little fund-raisers for people.'' Rumors in Chinatown\nAccording to The World Journal, rumors circulated through Chinatown yesterday that the attack may have been a vendetta against Mr. Chen over a business deal that fell through.\nRepeated efforts to reach Mr. Chen for comment were unavailing.\nThe cast members, who were from Taiwan and Hong Kong and had performed in Washington, Philadelphia and Boston before arriving in New York on Thursday, were sightseeing in Manhattan yesterday and were unavailable for comment.\nThe house manager at Town Hall, Benjamin B. Stevens, described the scene as ''complete chaos.'' He said the attacker ran from the stage to an alley adjacent to the theater where members of the audience and stagehands subdued him.\nThe World Journal published a 1,000-word article yesterday that recounted details of the attack.\nAccording to the newspaper, Mr. Cordova and another man, who was not identified, entered the theater near the end of the show.\nMr. Cordova then approached the front of the theater, climbed the stairs and stabbed Mr. Chiang.\nMr. and Mrs. Li said Mr. Cordova was wearing blue jeans, a blue denim jacket, a blue T-shirt with white stripes and black leather gloves.\nCast members had noticed the two men in the audience, most of whom were from the Chinese community, but believed they were theater employees, the Chinese newspaper said.\nMs. Planick said the Asian-American Republican National Federation had rented the hall for performances Thursday and last night. Last night's show was canceled and tickets were refunded. The federation also canceled future performances in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\nTickets for the variety show, ''The Night of Dragon,'' cost $100, $50, $30 and $20 each, according to Mr. Stevens.
531	POLICE RECEIVE 20 COMPLAINTS IN BIAS INCIDENTS	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D71638F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In the two weeks since the Howard Beach attack, at least 20 other racially or ethnically motivated incidents, ranging from verbal slurs to beatings, have been reported to the Police Department, police officials said yesterday.\nIn the two weeks since the Howard Beach attack, at least 20 other racially or ethnically motivated incidents, ranging from verbal slurs to beatings, have been reported to the Police Department, police officials said yesterday.\nThe officials said they could not determine whether the number of incidents had increased from the same period last year, as complete statistics were not yet available, although, they said, any such report was cause for concern.\nThe officials also said, however, that it appeared likely that more incidents were being reported in part because of heightened public awareness and sensitivity to race relations. They stressed that it was impossible to know how many of the incidents could be traced directly to the attack in Howard Beach, Queens, early on Dec. 20 in which three blacks were beaten and chased by a gang of white youths. One of the blacks was fatally struck by a car as he fled his attackers.\n''Whether some of the incidents would have occurred even without Howard Beach is very hard to say,'' said the commander of the department's Bias Incident Investigating Unit, Capt. Donald J. Bromberg. ''Even some of the incidents in which Howard Beach has been mentioned, it is possible that they might have occurred anyway and Howard Beach is the new war cry.'' Threats and Attacks\nOther police officials noted, for example, that after a bombing incident the authorities inevitably receive a flood of reports of suspicious briefcases and packages found on the street because the public's awareness of the potential danger is increased.\n''Each bias incident that occurs in the city is taken very, very seriously by the department,'' Captain Bromberg said. ''To have an increase, even if it's a small increase, and particularly when you've had an incident that ends in such tragic circumstances as a person's death, you have a lot of people that are concerned, and rightly so.''\nCitywide, since the Howard Beach case, the police have received reports of eight incidents of bias directed against blacks, six against whites, three against Hispanic people and three againts Jews, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Peter Sweeney. He said statistics for that period last year were unavailable.\nThe incidents have included verbal taunts and anonymous telephoned threats, as well as physical attacks that caused minor injuries, the police said. The words ''Howard Beach'' were reported to have been mentioned in some cases, but not all, the officials said.\nIncluding the initial case, seven such incidents have been reported in Queens since Dec. 20, Captain Bromberg said. For the entire month of December, 11 bias incidents were reported in Queens, compared with 7 in December 1985, the captain said. For all of 1986, 61 incidents were reported in Queens, compared with 56 in 1985. Citywide totals for the month and year were to be reviewed by top police officials before being released.\nAmong the cases the police have classified as bias incidents in recent days was one in which the transit police said a gang of more than 20 black youths, many chanting ''Howard Beach,'' beat up six riders on an A train early New Year's Day. But a Transit Authority spokesman, John Cunningham, said there were indications that the accused attackers, seven of whom were arrested, had come together ''primarily in a rampage and robbery spree.''\nCaptain Bromberg also said that was a possibility. ''We have to be very careful not to ignore a bias incident,'' he said. ''But you have to realize that crime often does cross racial lines and it's a matter of economics.''
532	DEATH TOLL AT 95 IN SAN JUAN BLAZE AS SEARCH GOES ON	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D71638F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The death toll in the New Year's Eve fire at the Dupont Plaza Hotel reached 95 today as workers continued to bring bodies out of the 22-story luxury hotel.\nThe death toll in the New Year's Eve fire at the Dupont Plaza Hotel reached 95 today as workers continued to bring bodies out of the 22-story luxury hotel.\nThe latest count was announced by Hector Rivera Cruz, Puerto Rico's Secretary of Justice, who added that a few more victims might still be buried in the thick rubble and badly damaged rooms.\nSearchers said that finding and removing the corpses, many burned beyond recognition, was time-consuming, especially because the searchers hoped to preserve evidence that might be useful to investigators. #27 Positively Identified Because so many corpses were so severely burned, only 27 have so far been identified, according to Police Superintendent Carlos Lopez Feliciano.\nThe body of the general manager of the Dupont Plaza, Brooke Thompson, was identified among the victims, as was Manuel Marrero, a United States Secret Service agent.\nAmong those missing and now presumed dead were 17 hotel employees.\nAlso reported dead was Margaret Ahrens, according to The Associated Press. She was a prominent performer of contemporary music in New York.\nThe A.P. also said the dead included Jose Rivera Janer, president of the newspaper El Reportero. He was a close associate of Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon's in electoral campaigns and held high-ranking positions in the Governor's first administration, from 1972 to 1976. Two months ago he was named president of the struggling newspaper, which has close ties to the Popular Democratic Party. 'Good Possibility' of Arson\nEarlier today, Mr. Rivera Cruz said there was ''a good possibility that this incident will turn out to be arson,'' but he added, ''We have to finish our investigation before we can conclude that.''\nRobert J. Creighton, the agent in charge of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, whose jurisdiction includes Puerto Rico, said in an interview today, ''We are definitely approaching this as a criminal investigation.''\nMr. Creighton said the investigators were focusing on labor unrest at the hotel as a likely motive. Some survivors said they had heard reports before the fire that there would be trouble in the Dupont Plaza that was related to labor problems.\nUnion leaders have denied any union role in the fire and have offered a reward for information on the causes. Asked about the possibility of a political motive involving Puerto Rican independence, he said, ''We are certainly looking into that.'' Management's Role Studied\nMr. Rivera Cruz said the possibility of criminal negligence on the part of the hotel's management was also under investigation.\nThe hotel management said it had complied with proper safety standards.\nThroughout the day, teams of investigators, civil defense workers and others labored in the tropical heat amid the noxious odors in and around the ravaged building. Paramedics vaccinated teams that had had contact with the dead.\nThe area around the casino and restaurant, where most of the deaths occurred, was opened to the press for the first time this morning. The scene was a mixture of the macabre and the normal. Macabre Scenes\nTwo floors were gutted. At the outdoor bar, the pina colada machine was scorched, but several bottles of liquor were still standing in a neat row nearby, their labels legible.\nThere were bloody towels on the adjoining beach, but a few yards away at the pool, palm trees were undamaged, plastic chairs were unmarred and paperback books, magazines and bottles of suntan lotion were strewn about the patio. A sign read: ''No Lifeguard on Duty - Swim at Your Own Risk.''\nBodies of some victims were found in hotel rooms today, according to workers. ''They died from smoke inhalation,'' said Rita Aparicio, an emergency medicine technician. ''The smoke went through the air conditioning system.'' Denial on Locking of Doors\nOther aspects of the case remained unclear. For example, a number of survivors said that when the fire broke out, some of the casino's exit doors were locked or barred by security personnel. Bruce Shulman, the Dupont Plaza's director, said today that ''the doors were not locked - people did exit.'' Reports to the contrary, he added, ''are being investigated.''\nMr. Shulman said also that three small fires that broke out in the 10 days before the disaster were reported to the police and that threatening letters sent to hotel managers in recent days had been turned over to the authorities. In response, he said, the hotel had hired 30 extra guards.\nMr. Lopez Feliciano, the Police Superintendent, said later that he did not know whether his department had received any letters from the hotel or whether any action had been taken in regard to them.\nMr. Shulman said he could not comment on the content of the letters, but he added that none specifically mentioned New Year's Eve. A Warning Over Radio? In light of the controversy over warnings, Mr. Shulman was asked about a union commercial that was broadcast by Noti Uno, an AM radio station. The ad, according to Victor Negron, a Noti Uno reporter, may have been aired dozens of times in December. It told listeners that negotiations were under way between the hotel management and representatives of the teamsters union, and that the Dupont Plaza was ''not the best place to be at year-end.''\nMr. Shulman said he had not been aware of the ad, which only ran in Spanish. Mr. Negron commented that others who had heard it, ''didn't think of it as a warning.''\nIn answer to other questions, Mr. Shulman said the hotel has failed no safety inspections and has complied with all safety regulations. Sprinkler systems, he said, are in use only in three locations: a hallway off the kitchen, a ninth floor linen closet and a utility room off the ballroom.\nAsked about reports that oxygen may have routinely been pumped into the casino to keep gamblers from feeling sleepy, he replied: ''I don't know. Oxygen is an extremely flammable substance.'' Oxygen-pumping is a practice in some mainland casinos.\nAt other gatherings, on the streets and in the cafes of San Juan today, there was continued speculation over who might be to blame for the fire.\nAt noon Governor Hernandez Colon held a memorial service for victims of the blaze in the garden of his official residence, La Fortaleza.\nAfterward, he said that if the fire was ''sabotage,'' he believed it was related to labor strife and had not been an act of political terrorism. Union spokesmen later said they refused to accept that assessment at this point.\nBaltasar Corrada del Rio, the president of the New Progressive Party, which advocates statehood for this Commonwealth, said one negotiator involved in the hotel's contract talks had been arrested in 1975 on charges related to racketeering and terrorism. He suggested that investigators should explore the possibility of links.\nThat negotiator, Jorge Farinacci, acknowledged today that he had been arrested in connection with the $7 million robbery of a Wells Fargo depot in 1983 in West Hartford, Conn., and that he has been released on $1 million bail.\nHe also said, however, that he had not been involved in the robbery and hoped to ''have a fair trial where I will establish my innocence.''\nHe called Mr. Corrada del Rio's statement ''an unjust and irresponsible insinuation.'' ---- Soprano Presumed Dead Miss Ahrens, a soprano who was reported among the dead in the San Juan fire, was a prominent performer of contemporary music in New York, and an occasional composer. Her ''Agnus Dei,'' for two sopranos and handbells, was described as ''a confection of monastic Minimalism'' by a Times critic when she performed it at Merkin Concert Hall in 1983.\nShe also performed often at the League of Composers/International Society for Contemporary Music and the Prism Chamber Orchestra. In New York she was heard in the music of Pierre Boulez, George Rochberg, Jean Barraque and numerous younger composers, as well as a special concert of music to words by Gertrude Stein in 1983.\nShe also sang earlier music, sometimes appearing with original-instrument ensembles in little-known Baroque music. Her last performance here was in Mr. Barraque's ''Au dela du Hasard'' at the Guggenheim Museum, in November 1986. Z\nCorrection: January 4, 1987, Sunday, Late City Final Edition

535	KEY ANSWERS LACKING IN QUEENS RACIAL ATTACK	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D61638F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In the two weeks since a racial attack in Howard Beach, Queens, many questions have arisen about the incident, the victims, the assailants and the way law-enforcement officials have handled the case, which is widely considered to be the city's most serious racial incident in years.\nIn the two weeks since a racial attack in Howard Beach, Queens, many questions have arisen about the incident, the victims, the assailants and the way law-enforcement officials have handled the case, which is widely considered to be the city's most serious racial incident in years.\nAccording to the police, a 23-year-old black man from Brooklyn, Michael Griffith, died when he was struck by a car as he fled a gang of white teen-agers who had beaten him and two companions with a baseball bat and a tree limb.\nThe accounts offered by the Queens District Attorney's office, by the Police Department and by lawyers and spokesmen for individuals involved in the incident have left a number of questions. Here is what is known, and not known, about the case so far:\nQ. Why is the man prosecutors describe as the key witness, Cedric Sandiford of Brooklyn, not cooperating with the investigators?\nA. The lawyer for Mr. Sandiford, the dead man's 36-year-old stepfather, advised him not to cooperate because he said the prosecutors were trying to make ''a case'' for the white defendants.\nThe lawyer, Alton H. Maddox Jr., said Mr. Sandiford cooperated with prosecutors and detectives for three days after the attack, despite eye and head wounds he suffered in the attack.\nBut Mr. Maddox said he advised his client not to view a lineup at the 106th Precinct on Dec. 22, or to testify at a preliminary hearing before Judge Ernest Bianchi in Queens Criminal Court on Dec. 29, unless charges were filed against the driver of the car that struck and killed Mr. Griffith.\nMr. Maddox says the driver, 24-year-old Dominick Blum, a court officer who is white, was a willful participant in the attack.\nQ. Was Mr. Blum a willful participant in the attack?\nA. Investigators say they do not believe so.\nQ. Have the police questioned the people Mr. Blum says he was with?\nA. Yes. One of Mr. Blum's companions, Barry Melkin of Flushing, Queens, was given a polygraph test. He passed the test, law-enforcement officials said.\nQ. How serious are Mr. Sandiford's injuries?\nA. It is not clear. Mr. Maddox says Mr. Sandiford suffered head and eye injuries, but he was released from Jamaica Hospital hours after the attack. Thomas McCarthy, a spokesman for the District Attorney's office, says prosecutors discussed presenting Mr. Sandiford's medical records to Judge Bianchi in an effort to postpone the preliminary hearing until the witness was well enough to appear.\nBut, according to Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Maddox did not turn over the records or a statement on Mr. Sandiford's condition. ''Maddox said you're not going to use that as a excuse for a continuance,'' Mr. McCarthy said.\nQ. Do the suspects still face any charges in the case?\nA. Yes. Judge Bianchi let stand a lesser charge, reckless endangerment, against the three, Jon L. Lester, 17, of Ozone Park, Queens; Scott Kern, 17, and Jason Ladone, 16, both of Howard Beach. Q. Why did John J. Santucci, the\nQueens District Attorney, take the unusual step of proceeding to a preliminary hearing instead of presenting the case directly to a grand jury?\nA. The district attorney and Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward have said that officials preferred to air the evidence in such a sensitive case in a public forum rather than behind the closed doors of a grand jury room.\nQ. Did Mr. Santucci see any potential advantages in that course of action?\nA. Yes. Mr. Santucci's aides have said that a public hearing relieves the district attorney of criticism from those eager for a murder indictment or those preferring lesser charges, who can instead fault the judge.\nBut in this case, some of the aides said, the strategy apparently backfired, because there has been an outcry anyway.\nQ. Was Mr. Santucci under time pressure to act?\nA. Yes. Law-enforcement officials cite a state law requiring persons held without bail on felony complaints to be released after five days unless a grand jury or a judge has established there is reasonable cause to continue their incarceration.\nThat deadline came up last Monday, the day of the hearing.\nWith Mr. Sandiford refusing to cooperate, the prosecutors decided that it was unrealistic to turn immediately to a grand jury. Q. Can the case continue without Mr. Sandiford?\nA. Yes, but it would be extremely difficult, legal experts say.\nHe is apparently the only person known to prosecutors, other than the white assailants, who could have seen the final stages of the beating and Mr. Griffith's flight onto the parkway.\nProsecutors could try to convince one or more of the teen-agers to testify against the others. Under state law, however, an acomplice's testimony must be corroborated by a nonparticipating witness or by physical evidence. And the police have no physical evidence to link the attackers to Mr. Griffith.\nQ. Other than Mr. Sandiford, did anyone see the attack and provide corroborating testimony?\nA. There are apparently witnesses to the first part of the attack, which occurred outside the New Park Pizzeria, on Cross Bay Boulevard at 157th Avenue.\nBut in this early stage of the incident, only assault, not murder or manslaughter, is involved.\nQ. Was Mr. Sandiford the only witness to the attack's fatal conclusion?\nA. Possibly not. Law-enforcement sources say the police received a telephone call from a Howard Beach woman, apparently while the attack was going on. She reported that blacks were attacking a white. She called from a pay telephone, and detectives have been unable to find her.\nQ. Did Mr. Sandiford see the car hit Mr. Griffith?\nA. Apparently not. According to a spokesman for Mr. Santucci: ''At no time has Mr. Sandiford said he saw the accident either to us or to the police. He never told us that. He told us he heard a noise.''\nQ. Why were no charges filed against seven other youths who were questioned as possible suspects in the beatings?\nA. The authorities decided not to charge them after Mr. Sandiford failed to go to the 106th Precinct on Dec. 22 to view a lineup. Q. Did the police strip-search Mr. Sandiford after they found him wandering, dazed, near the parkway?\nA. Mr. Maddox says yes. The police say no, although they acknowledge that he was frisked, a procedure they describe as routine under the circumstances.\nQ. Is there anything unusual about the way the police treated Mr. Blum?\nA. The police say that when Mr. Blum returned to the scene with his father, a police officer, they arrived in the father's undamaged Dodge Colt, not the Dodge Aspen he was driving when he hit Mr. Griffith.\nMr. Blum told one police officer investigating the accident that he had been driving his own car, the Aspen, when he hit Mr. Griffith. But that officer failed to tell accident investigators, who assumed Mr. Blum had been driving his father's car, the undamaged Colt.\nAs a result, the investigators decided that the Colt could not possibly have been involved in a fatal accident, and sent the Blums home.\nQ. When did the police realize a different car was involved?\nA. A few hours later, when they reviewed the accident reports. They immediately summoned Mr. Blum and told him to bring the Aspen. Q. Why did they not arrest Mr. Blum then?\nA. They said they did not believe an arrest was warranted because he had not denied involvement in an accident, had returned to the scene and was not considered likely to avoid the authorities. A grand jury could still indict him.\nQ. Why was Mr. Blum not tested for alcohol or drugs when he returned to the accident scene?\nA. Mr. Blum was not tested for intoxication, the police say, because there was no indication that his speech was impaired, and he appeared to be walking normally when he returned to the scene.

''We have begun a dialogue.''\nThe news conference took place in the gym at St. Helen's Church at 84th Street and 157th Avenue, several blocks from where Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old Brooklyn man, was killed by a car on the Shore Parkway after fleeing from a gang of white youths. 'Swift and Convincing Justice'\n''The type of crime that was committed here a number of weeks ago has shocked the social conscience of the community and the entire city,'' Mr. Russo, who grew up in Howard Beach, said. ''The racial motivation of these actions has shaken the fabric that holds this ethnic and racially diverse city together. This type of conduct requires swift and convincing justice.''\nMr. Russo, a 32-year-old lawyer and president of District 27 Community School Board, was joined by the other co-chairman, the Rev. Irving Bryer Jr., 39, pastor of the Hollis Avenue Congregational Church in Queens Village, in making the statement.\n''We cannot condemn all the members of this community for the acts of a few,'' Mr. Bryer said. ''There are many good people in this community. They're committed, they're honest people and they deplore the violence that has happened.''\nHe called on parents to urge their children to ''resist the temptation of continuing the violence'' when schools reopen Monday.\nThe group will publish a newsletter for distribution in houses of worship and through civic groups in south Queens that will keep residents informed of human relations programs and events.\nThe group will also ask the Board of Education to create or expand sports activities to bring young black and white students together and ask for funds for cultural programs.\nMr. Russo said residents would be invited to a meeting to explore issues and an interfaith prayer vigil within the next two weeks.\nThe grass-roots group had its first meeting in the Rockwood Park Jewish Center, adjacent to St. Helen's gym and school, several days after the attack, Mr. Russo said.\nA dozen Howard Beach residents who were not part of the coalition attended the news conference.\nFrank DeRicco, 50, owner of a lamp manufacturing company, said: ''Positive things were said here today. I see black and white people together come here to do something about the problem and they're not condemning the community.''\nThomas Malcolm, 52, a grants management specialist, said racism is a problem everywhere.\n''We are dealing with attitudes,'' Mr. Malcolm, who is black, said. ''It's not enough to stick your head in the sand and say 'this will go away,' or 'it didn't involve my kids.' Each and every one of us have to say 'there but for the grace of God go I.' ''
537	CHARGES UPHELD AGAINST TWO IN ATTACK ON WHITE	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DF1738F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A white teen-ager from Queens gave a harrowing account in court yesterday of how he was attacked by a gang of black youths yelling that they wanted to avenge an earlier attack on three black men in Howard Beach.\nA white teen-ager from Queens gave a harrowing account in court yesterday of how he was attacked by a gang of black youths yelling that they wanted to avenge an earlier attack on three black men in Howard Beach.\nThe victim, 17-year-old Jeffrey McCarthy, testified in Criminal Court in Queens at a hearing for three young men who are charged with assaulting him while he was walking to a bus stop three days after the Howard Beach incident.\nAt the end of the four-hour hearing, Judge Ernest Bianchi ruled there was enough evidence to uphold charges of second-degree assault and aggravated harassment against Michael English, 20, of Jamaica, Queens, and Derrick Brown, 18, of South Jamaica, Queens. However, he dismissed charges against the third defendant, Richard Garces, 17, also of Jamaica, Queens, at the request of the prosecutor because a key witness had refused to testify.\nJudge Bianchi's ruling came four days after he dismissed charges of murder, manslaughter and assault against the three white defendants in the Howard Beach assault on three black men. The judge let stand charges of reckless endangerment. He said there was insufficient evidence to warrant the more serious charges because a key witness had refused to testify.\nCalling the defendants in court yesterday ''punks,'' the judge said: ''What you did was reprehensible. What did this fellow have to do with Howard Beach?'' Suspects Deny Charges\nAll three men have denied participating in the attack, including Mr. English, who was arrested after having boasted on a television news show that he had participated. Mr. English later told the police that he had not taken part. Neither Mr. McCarthy nor other witnesses have been able to place him at the scene, according to yesterday's testimony. Mr. McCarthy did identify Mr. Brown in a lineup.\nMr. McCarthy said he was heading for his Flushing home after visiting a Motor Vehicles Department office when he was attacked about 3:30 P.M. on Dec. 23 at Hillside Avenue and Merrick Boulevard in a heavily black area of Jamaica.\nOne of his assailants - Mr. McCarthy said he did not know how many there were - yelled, ''Howard Beach! Howard Beach!'' the victim said. He said another yelled, ''He's a white boy and they killed a black boy in Howard Beach!'' This was a reference to Michael Griffith, who was killed by a car while fleeing white youths in Howard Beach.\n''I kept walking,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''A black man approached me and hit me in the side of the face.'' Mr. McCarthy said he began running, but one of his attackers - whom he later identified as Mr. Brown - raced in front of him and kicked him in the right side. Mr. McCarthy said he was tackled and fell face down.\n''I was getting kicked in the back of the head, which forced my face to hit the pavement several times,'' he said. ''I heard someone say, 'That's enough. Leave him alone,' and everyone ran away and I was left lying on the street.'' According to the police, the attackers dispersed when several white men ran to the victim's defense.\nJudge Bianchi allowed Mr. English to remain free on his own recognizance and reduced Mr. Brown's bail to $3,500, from $7,500. Mr. Brown did not immediatley post it and was returned to jail.

J. Dozier, Penn State's senior tailback, a face in a crowd in a conservative sports jacket, more than willing, he said, to place the needs of his team ahead of personal gain.\nThey are mirror images of their respective teams, Mike Irvin, Miami's sophomore wide receiver, flashy on the field and off, his black warm-ups accented by two gold chains, dark sunglasses and a studded earring; D. J. Dozier, Penn State's senior tailback, a face in a crowd in a conservative sports jacket, more than willing, he said, to place the needs of his team ahead of personal gain.\nBefore the game, Irvin and Dozier were seen as having something in common: both were barometers of the way their teams were playing. So if Irvin, a game breaker who already holds the Miami career record with 20 touchdown catches, could find openings in the Penn State secondary, then he and Vinny Testaverde, the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, could lead the Hurricanes to a one-sided victory in the Fiesta Bowl to determine the No. 1 team in the country.\nBut if Dozier could keep the Miami defense on its heels with his ability to run inside and out, thus enabling Penn State to control the ball, the Nittany Lions' chances of winning would multiply. The strategy was to keep Testaverde on the sidelines as much as possible.\nAs it turned out, Testaverde was on the field a lot - long enough to be intercepted five times in a 14-10 loss. 94 Yards, Winning Touchdown Dozier got his yardage - 94 on 18 carries, including the 6-yard run in the fourth quarter that put the Lions ahead to stay.\nFor the fourth consecutive year, Dozier led Penn State in rushing, gaining 811 yards in the regular season, becoming the second leading runner in school history, behind Curt Warner. Still, Dozier could have been better had he not been slowed by injuries during his four years at Penn State, gaining 1,000 yards or more only as a freshman. He was healthy this season but Joe Paterno favored a balanced offense, passing more often and using five running backs to wear down opponents.\n''The guy I felt bad for this year was D. J.,'' said John Shaffer, the Penn State quarterback. ''He could have been a Heisman Trophy candidate at another school, carrying 30 times a game. We felt, though, that we had a lot of people to run the ball.''\nDozier, who is from Virginia Beach, Va., said there are no regrets. ''I'm the type who does what he is asked and more,'' he said. ''You can't have a selfish attitude on this team, not with the other backs we have. My mother and father brought me up that way and that's the way Joe coaches. I love football, it's important to me, but it's not the only thing in my life.''\nThe 6-foot-1-inch, 204-pound Dozier came close to matching Warner's performance in the 1981 Fiesta Bowl, when Warner gained 145 yards to lead the Lions to a 26-10 victory over Southern Cal. Irvin Quick, Defense Quicker\nIrvin was one of the reasons the Hurricanes were clear-cut favorites. His speed and quickness typifies the Miami offense, but the Penn State defense was deceptively quick, largely shutting Irvin down.\nWhen he and Testaverde were redshirted in 1984, they spent a great deal of time practicing together, which carried over into the summer of '85. They have been a team ever since.\n''I remember how jittery we both were before our first game last season,'' Irvin said. ''But Vinny showed confidence in me right from the start. He knows where I like to catch passes in certain situations, in my hands or my body. He'll give me hand signals at the line of scrimmage after reading a defense. In the huddle, when he tells me a play is going to be a touchdown, it usually is. We work well.''\nIrvin was one of three talented Miami wide receivers, Brian Blades and Brett Perriman were the others, but Irvin was considered the best long threat. He figured Penn State would play a deep zone, giving him short gains over the middle. The Lions often used their all-America linebacker Shane Conlan, in man-to-man coverage in those situations.\nThe thought of being covered by a linebacker made Irvin smile. He doesn't think there are any who can keep up with him. ''Penn State let's you nibble but not take the big bite,'' he said, more prophetic than he knew.\nPaterno compared Irvin to Lynn Swann, a compliment that briefly left Irvin speechless. ''My favorites have been Kellen Winslow and James Lofton,'' he said.\nHe was miffed when he made only second team all-America, which he guessed can be attributed to the fact he is only a sophomore. Like his teammates, Irvin does not lack confidence. ''We want to put Penn State away early and celebrate the rest of the game,'' he said. ''We don't feel the pressure or get intimidated. You put the spotlight on us and we enjoy it.'' Tonight, Penn State enjoyed it even more.
539	PENN STATE INTERCEPTS MIAMI FOR NATIONAL TITLE	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DE1738F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: An aggressive and confusing Penn State defense consistently harassed, often outsmarted and yet just barely thwarted Vinny Testaverde, the Heisman Trophy winner, to win the national championship tonight.\nAn aggressive and confusing Penn State defense consistently harassed, often outsmarted and yet just barely thwarted Vinny Testaverde, the Heisman Trophy winner, to win the national championship tonight.\nTestaverde, the Miami quarterback from Elmont, L.I., threw five interceptions in an improbable 14-10 Penn State victory in the Fiesta Bowl that ended Miami's perfect season after 11 victories and gave the Nittany Lions (12-0) their second national title in five seasons.\nSoon after the fourth interception, which was Shane Conlan's second of the game, D. J. Dozier scored a 6-yard touchdown run with 8 minutes 13 seconds to play for the winning margin. The fifth interception, Pete Giftopoulos's second of the game on a fourth-down pass at the Penn State 1-yard line, ended a frantic drive with nine seconds to play. Despair Among Celebrants\nTestaverde, who completed 26 of 50 passes for 285 yards - but no touchdowns - was left alone, bent over in despair, as Penn State players and onrushing fans celebrated all around.\n''We had a goal from the beginning of the year, and we fell short,'' he said. ''It's that simple. And it hurts a lot.''\nPenn State was outgained, 445 yards to 162. John Shaffer, the Penn State fifth-year senior quarterback, completed just 5 of 16 passes for 53 yards, with one interception. But despite Penn State's success in avoiding the long gain and unnerving Testaverde, the Nittany Lions watched him lead a breathless drive in the final seconds.\nTestaverde completed a 32-yard pass in a fourth-and-six play from the Miami 27-yard line to give the Hurricanes their final chance. He completed the next five passes to carry the Hurricanes to the Penn State 6.\nOn second down and goal, he was hit by Tim Johnson, a tackle, for a 7-yard loss to the 13.\nOn third down, after a timeout, Testaverde threw to the right where a halfback, Warren Williams, dived and juggled the ball but failed to hold onto the pass. A Prayerful Paterno\nThere were 18 seconds to someone's national championship. ''There's not much you can do,'' said Joe Paterno, the Penn State coach. ''I'm not the kind of guy that likes to pray for the Good Lord to take care of a football game. I figure He has better things to do. But I was tempted to pray.''\nHis defense accomplished more than prayer could. Testaverde dropped back and searched for Brett Perriman, a split end, who was curling in the left side of the end zone. Giftopoulos, one of the linebackers whose play disrupted the short pass routes all night, dropped into the coverage. ''Like he knew were I was going exactly,'' Testaverde said.\nGiftopoulos made the game-saving play that began the celebration. Just as the first Penn State champions limited Georgia's Herschel Walker, the 1982 Heisman Trophy winner, to win the Sugar Bowl four Januarys ago, the Nittany Lions challenged Testaverde to make big plays - and foiled his efforts when he tried - before an overflow crowd of 73,098 at Sun Devil Stadium.\nThe Hurricanes took a 10-7 fourth-quarter lead on a 28-yard field goal by Mark Seelig, who had earlier missed a 28-yard attempt. But an equally brilliant Hurricane defensive effort was undone by a nightmarish collection of seven turnovers and nine penalties.\nTestaverde, who was intercepted just nine times all season, turned the high-powered Miami offense into a far more efficient unit this year. But Penn State challenged the Hurricane offense with a strategy that was as effective as it was expected. Disguised Zone Coverage\nThe Lions tried to unnerve the Heisman Trophy winner with different types of blitzes. Rather than expose its defensive backs with one-on-one coverage when the blitzes were on, Penn State usually employed zone coverages, keeping three defenders deep to defend against the long pass. Underneath, the Lions often inserted an extra linebacker. In the line, the Lions shuttled in fresh players.\nThe strategy risked the consistent completion of 10- to 20-yard passes by a fifth-year senior who has become as capable of dissecting defenses as any quarterback in the country. But in the second quarter, Testaverde started doing something that seemed uncharacteristic.\nThe usually composed quarterback ignored some opportunities for safe - if shorter - gains in risky attempts to pick up more yardage. The first Miami turnover, a fumble by Mike Irvin, the sophomore receiver, at the Hurricane 44, came after a perfect Testaverde pass on third down that caught the speedy receiver in full stride. But Ray Isom, a Penn State safety, met Irvin squarely just after the pass arrived, Duffy Cobbs recovered and the Canes had been stopped abruptly.\n''They were talking about how short our defensive backs were, and how slow they were,'' Conlan said. ''I said they haven't been hit by them. Those little guys rocked them. They didn't want to catch the ball.''\nMiami's defense, meanwhile, was controlling the game from the game's first play from scrimmage. Shaffer, the maligned Penn State quarterback, was twice tackled for losses in his first series. But John Bruno, the senior punter, averaged 43.4 yards in 9 punts, and often forced the Hurricanes to begin deep in their own territory.\nAt the start of the second quarter, with the game still scoreless, Miami's second turnover could be attributed more to greed. On a third-down play from the Miami 42, needing 9 yards for a first down, Testaverde had Brian Blades, his split end, open on the right side for more than enough first-down yardage. But Testaverde chose to go for the longer play, threw for the halfback, Melvin Bratton, and the pass was intercepted by Cobbs. Signs of Testiness\nFor Testaverde, one uncharacteristic moment was followed by another. After Cobbs returned the interception to the Penn State 30 and the teams were headed back to the benches, Testaverde suddenly became involved in brief and uneventful shoving match. But the heated moment, immediately after his unusually poor choice, seemed to provide evidence that Penn State had at least temporarily succeeded in unnerving a Heisman Trophy winner.\nShaffer, however, seemed more than unnerved; he appeared overwhelmed. He had lost just once in 66 games as a starting quarterback since his days as a seventh-grader in Cincinnati. But the one loss came when the lights had been brightest, a year and a night ago when Oklahoma intercepted three passes in Penn State's Orange Bowl loss.\nTonight, on Penn State's second possession of the second quarter, Shaffer dropped back to pass on second down from the 32. With Brown, the defensive tackle, grabbing at Shaffer's feet, he began to move his right arm forward and appeared to suddenly decide not to pass. But the ball fell out of his hand and nearly straight down, where Bill Hawkins, a defensive end, caught it on the ground at the Penn State 23. The bizarre play was defined as a fumble by Shaffer, but Hawkins was credited with an interception because Shaffer went through a throwing motion and the ball never hit the ground.\nRegardless, the Hurricanes had their first break of an emotionally charged night. Soon, Bratton completed a brief drive with a diving 1-yard score that finally put the favored Hurricanes ahead.\nPenn State responded with its first sustained drive of the evening, a cautious, 74-yard trip downfield on the running of both Tim Manoa and Dozier and a series of short passes. Shaffer's 23-yard throw to a slanting Eric Hamilton put the Lions into Miami territory. Gains of 19 and 12 by Manoa helped bring the Lions to the 5.\nFrom the 4, Shaffer rolled to his right, looked for a receiver in the end zone, looked some more, faked a pass, and saw an opening. ''I was waiting for a receiver to get open, and they never did,'' Shaffer said. ''So I just turned on the 4.2 speed.''\nHe slid behind a block by the tight end Brian Siverling and dived into the end zone. The struggling quarterback picked himself up and punched his fist in the air on what was suddenly not such an overwhelming night.\nUntil the end of that night, who would have guessed that Testaverde's season would end in frustration? ''Tomorrow will probably be a better day for everybody,'' a Heisman winner said tonight.

The same day, Canada capitulated to United States pressure and agreed to tax lumber exports. Yesterday, Washington narrowed the duty-free preferences it grants to less-developed countries. And right in the middle of all this turmoil, the Commerce Department reported that the November trade deficit was the country's biggest ever in a single month.\nIt's been a bad week on the trade front, and things could easily get worse. The continued imbalance of imports and exports intensifies pressure on Congress for protectionist legislation. The Administration is trying to head it off with a show of toughness that comes perilously close to just the protectionism it says it wants to avoid.\nThe immediate effect of these escalating hostilities will be higher prices for American consumers. The long-run danger, growing closer with each new move, is a trade war that will cripple everyone.\nAmerica's confrontation with Europe dates back a year, when Spain joined the Common Market and had to adopt its blatantly protectionist tariffs on agricultural imports. That cost American farmers $400 million a year in grain exports, according to Washington's calculations. If Europe won't offset this loss by easing its barriers to other American products, the Administration proposes punitive tariffs on $400 million of European products sold to Americans, mainly British gin, French brandy, Dutch cheese, cheap wine from West Germany and olives from the Mediterranean countries. The first deadline for agreement, last summer, was extended to Dec. 31. Not satisfied with the concessions that Europe offers, the Administration has now set the 200 percent tariffs to take effect Jan. 31. If that happens, the Common Market has already announced countermeasures effective 15 days later. Both sides may be bluffing, but the fuse is lit. Even assuming agreement, deeper issues promise more conflict. Farm subsidies on both sides of the Atlantic create huge surpluses that translate directly into curbs on farm imports. Another farm battle brews across the Pacific, over Japan's highly subsidized market for rice. All of the major countries' farm programs need to be rationalized; all of their farmers pack effective political punch.\nNonfarm trade is just as contentious. In recent months, the Administration has cracked down on machine tools, Japanese computer chips and now Canada's softwood lumber. Chip restrictions have since been eased, but imports remain regulated. As for lumber, rather than let Washington tax imports with a tariff, Canada chose to tax them itself, adding at least $1,000 to the price of a new home.\nThe only bright spots in this surge of new restrictions are things the Administration didn't do. It again put off punishing Brazil for its curbs on American computer equipment and it kept the new limits on duty-free imports to a minimum.\nTrade restrictions are growth restrictions. At a time when industrialized and developing countries alike need faster growth, the industrial powers are leading in the wrong direction. The only way to win at Trade War is not with more war but with Trade Peace.

Suspecting that the Cardinal didn't know very much about the nuances of the Middle East, Shimon Peres, then Israel's Prime Minister, extended an invitation to him to come visit. That suspicion proved correct; yet the Cardinal has learned from his error and taught by his example.\nWithout realizing he was breaching Vatican policy, the Cardinal scheduled visits in Jerusalem with Israel's heads of state and government. That's wrong, in Vatican eyes, because the Pope does not recognize Israeli control over the Holy City. So the Cardinal canceled his appointments abruptly, and then compounded the slight to Israel by going ahead with his visits in Jordan to King Hussein and other leaders.\nUltimately, the Cardinal softened the slight and salvaged honor all around by meeting with Mayor Teddy Kollek in Jerusalem. Why was that encounter acceptable, unlike the others? ''Because the city is not a political entity,'' declared the Mayor. ''It is an administrative entity.'' A demurring reporter said he couldn't understand the difference. ''Neither do I,'' said the Mayor.\nOf such stuff are quarrels made in the Middle East. The Vatican's policy does indeed offend sense. It can be said in mitigation that splitting hairs is not the newest practice in the Holy Land.\nMaking the best of an inept business, Cardinal O'Connor and Mayor Kollek placed a good-humored call to Mayor Koch in New York. And the Cardinal declared: ''I failed to be sufficiently thorough in my preparations. I failed to familiarize myself with the protocols normally surrounding a visit by a member of the College of Cardinals. Because of that error on my part, unfortunately, it is quite understandable that the people of Israel and those in the Government might well have construed some deliberately intended offense.''\nIt's a handsome apology, graciously phrased to correct a blunder based on a Vatican policy that still awaits correction.

Corporate sponsorship of individual games started last fall during the regular season, but it has become more noticeable with the renaming of holiday bowl games.\nThis year an insurance company put its John Hancock on the Sun Bowl; Sunkist squeezed into the Fiesta Bowl; Madza adopted the Gator Bowl, and an insurance company called U.S.F.& G. laid claim to the Sugar Bowl. With two dozen major and minor bowls available and bowl committees shedding their inhibitions about selling them, the trend promises to accelerate.\nSponsorship gives the bowl committee a hefty chunk of cash, gives the corporation close identification with a popular event and gives the networks cheaper television rights. Everybody makes out, except maybe the longtime fan, left to wonder why even the name of the game is now commercialized.\nActually, college football comes late to this business. Tennis fans have long since grown accustomed to the Volvo, Virginia Slims, Nabisco or other tournament. Tennis players have become walking billboards, with company names and logos plastered everywhere but on their bottoms. Professional golf also has long welcomed corporate sponsorship of tournaments.\nCollege football has been inhibited by tradition and by the need to maintain an illusion of amateurism. In theory, college games are pleasant diversions between enthusiastic young scholars; they just happen to play in huge stadiums and before television's millions. Corporate sponsorship further dispels that illusion.\nThere could also be a plus here for the ordinary fan: fewer, shorter commercial timeouts. That should occur about the same time that plain tennis whites return to the U.S. Open.

A judge ordered replacement of the psychiatric wards in 1982. The unit didn't become fully occupied until last January, two years behind schedule and 15 percent over the original $20 million budget. The delay also cost the city an estimated $8 million in lost Federal and state reimbursement.\nWhat went wrong? Nearly everything. Walls were paneled before heating and ventilation ducts were installed. A ceiling went up without electrical wiring. Holes for lighting fixtures were cut in the wrong direction. Some 40,000 square feet of wood parquet floors - an area bigger than Central Park's Wollman Skating Rink - must be replaced because they buckle dangerously when mopped.\nFor this mess, the Health and Hospitals Corporation deserves a worm. Governor Cuomo and Mayor Koch support repeal of the state's outmoded Wicks Law that hampers big public works by requiring multiple contractors. For blocking its repeal, the biggest worm of all goes to the State Senate minority leader, Manfred Ohrenstein, and the majority leader, Warren Anderson. Pursuing Peddlers At long last, New York City has started enforcing its laws against street and sidewalk peddling. Until the last two weeks, Fifth Avenue had come to resemble what one merchant called ''Istanbul on a Sunday.'' With the holiday season, protests from Fifth Avenue store and property owners finally brought action against all the unlicensed peddlers hawking scarves, watches and trinkets from makeshift tables and blankets spread over half the sidewalk. The merchants' complaints are justified: peddlers steal business from legitimate retailers, block already crowded sidewalks and cheat the city of millions in unpaid taxes.\nDuring Christmas week, the Police Department's newly reinforced peddler patrol made more than 200 arrests and seized goods by the truckload. For the first time in memory, pedestrians were able to stroll Fifth Avenue virtually peddler-free from 42d Street to 59th Street. Mayor Koch deserves half an apple for this last-minute crackdown. He and Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward will be entitled to a whole one if they expand holiday attention to Fifth Avenue into a year-round effort to clear busy sidewalks throughout midtown.

In his three years at the budget agency, which tries to bring accuracy and objective underpinning to judgments about the economy and Federal budgets, he managed to survive with little partisan criticism.\nStill, to maintain some balance at the agency and to take account of the Democratic majorities in both houses as of next Tuesday when the 100th Congress convenes, aides to senior members of Congress say they have been looking for a successor with more liberal credentials.\nOne of their quarry was Barry P. Bosworth, who was the No. 1 inflation fighter in the Carter White House and is now at the Brookings Institution.\n''My gentle answer was no,'' Mr. Bosworth said in reponse to an inquiry about overtures to succeed Mr. Penner. He then noted his reservations with some candor: ''Too much administrative work. It's a big organization, and it needs a good administrator. Another thing that discouraged me was trying to deal with so many people who are your boss.'' WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING

Earlier, in the middle of the last century, three Washburn brothers occupied seats in the House: Cadwallader of Wisconsin, Israel Jr. of Maine and Elihu of Illinois. The very first Congress, in fact, had a pair of brothers from Pennsylvania: Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg, who became Speaker of the House, and John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, also in the House.\nThere are now only two brothers in the Congress, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan and Representative Sander Levin, from Detroit. Now the pair claim another distinction, a philatelic first, as it were. They say they have produced the first cachet, or seal on an envelope, ever created by brothers who are members of Congress. The seal, which commemorates the Michigan sesquicentennial, to be celebrated Jan. 26, is taken from the state seal. It depicts a man with a rifle watching the sun rise over a lake and is inscribed ''Tuebor,'' or ''I will defend.''\nThe siblings are printing 1,000 copies of the envelope to go on sale as first-day covers at $10, the proceeds to be donated to the American Philatelic Society's youth activities fund.\nWASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING Correction: February 11, 1987, Wednesday, Late City Final Edition

557	Final Grade: 66-1	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED81438F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The cut on John Shaffer's forehead was from ''one of the sacks,'' but he said his dazed look came from ''all that hugging.''\nThe cut on John Shaffer's forehead was from ''one of the sacks,'' but he said his dazed look came from ''all that hugging.''\nPenn State football players even hug hard, particularly after winning the unofficial national college championship with a 14-10 victory over Miami in the Fiesta Bowl last night.\nShaffer is an academic all-American, a walking advertisement for the propriety of the Penn State football program, a man who had lost only one of 66 games as a starting quarterback in his life, going back to the seventh grade.\nBut that one loss had stung. It came in the Orange Bowl a year ago, when Penn State was swamped by Oklahoma, 25-10, and Shaffer was lifted in the second half. Last night he faced the specter of that one loss, in addition to the looming presence of the Heisman Trophy winner, Vinny Testaverde.\nTestaverde passed for 285 yards and Shaffer passed for only 53 yards, but Shaffer won the interception statistic, 1 to 5, and even rumbled for a touchdown in most inelegant fashion.\nWith that glorious arm that took Miami downfield in the final minutes, Testaverde is quite likely to be wooed by Ray Perkins, the new chief executive officer of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who own the first pick in the National Football League draft.\nThe Miami quarterback, who has spent one year at prep school and five years more or less on the college campus without hiding his disinterest in schoolwork, is otherwise known for falling off his motorbike and protecting his sack of burgers and fries.\nShaffer, who passed for 1,510 yards this year, is also known for his 3.21 average, based upon 4 as a perfect score. He was named to the GTE Academic All-American team, which includes major players with averages of at least 3.2.\nAnd last night John Shaffer stood on the 44-yard-line (''my favorite number'') and watched the Heisman Trophy winner have a pass intecepted for the fifth time on fourth-and-goal.\n''Pure ecstasy,'' was the way Shaffer described his feelings long afterward. ''I tell you what: We've got some of the neatest people on our football team. We share everything.\n''Nothing was further from my mind than being vindicated,'' Shaffer replied to a question. ''We played a good football team and we scored just enough points to win the game.'' Shaffer is more likely to be recruited by major corporations and graduate schools than a professional team. He isn't giving up on being drafted, but he knew that his second straight chance at a national championship might be the last game of his career.\nHis other championship game was a year ago in the Orange Bowl, when Penn State and Oklahoma met, knowing that Miami had blown its chance to Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl. This was before the Fiesta Bowl cut a deal with NBC to stretch New Year's Day to the night of Jan. 2, to capture the two unbeaten independent teams for a true showdown, with Joe Paterno of Penn State and many others campaigning to use this event as the springboard to an annual championship game.\n''There is definitely a lot more hype for this one,'' Shaffer said the other day. ''This is the game, moved to prime time, probably one of the most-watched college events in a long time.\n''What helps us,'' he added, ''was that we went through it last year.''\nWhat he went through last year could also be called a wringer that included Brian Bosworth, the Oklahoma all-America punk-rock linebacker, and some pre-game ridicule from a few reporters and broadcasters in Miami.\n''You had a 3.2 student, and before he ever threw the ball, he was being called a fraud,'' Paterno recalled. Paterno and Shaffer don't claim the scorn affected the quarterback, but he wound up completing 10 of 22 passes for only 74 yards and was intercepted three times. It was clear that the junior quarterback on a team contending for a national title could not throw the ball long enough and hard enough to score a few quick touchdowns, and Paterno pulled him in the second half.\n''He made two bad plays,'' Paterno conceded the other day, ''but a lot of it is the way the game goes. We gave up a bomb early and we were always behind. We never got 'em out of whack. And in fairness to John, our wideouts and offensive line were only ordinary.''\nAfter losing as a starting quarterback for the first time in his life, Shaffer spent three days in Miami with his parents before returning to campus. He has said he did not brood over the loss; others say he did.\n''He took it,'' Paterno said. ''He kept his pride. He's very mature. He just couldn't wait for the next game. All year, I've seen a lot of bounce out there.''\nThe bounce is as much mental as physical. Shaffer doesn't run or throw with professional potential, but he is a fine quarterback for a program that traditionally produces more great defensive players than offensive players. Last night, Shaffer could not move the team at all until Miami scored. Paterno said of the total 5-for-16 passing: ''I didn't think Shaffer had much time. John's the kind of guy who gets it done, if you give him time.''\nShaffer produced a 74-yard drive in 13 plays that ended with his rolling right for a 4-yard touchdown.\n''We had to wait for the play to develop,'' Shaffer said.. ''I didn't see it, so I had to run with the ball.''\nHe just did rumble across the right corner to help tie the game. Then Shane Conlan, the latest of the great Penn State linebackers, playing with reinjured legs, ran 38 yards with an interception to reach the Miami 5.\nShaffer fumbled the handoff on first down and Keith Radecic, his center, recovered for a 1-yard loss. Then Shaffer made sure D. J. Dozier had his hands on the ball, and the line opened a hole for the touchdown that won a national title.\nShaffer's role was not of a Heisman Trophy winner, but that of another willing hand on a disciplined team -but last night that was quite enough for John Shaffer, academic all-American, winning quarterback for the 66th time in 67 games.\nSPORTS OF THE TIMES

''She has a fracture in each knee,'' her trainer, Mel Stute, said. ''Dr. Greg Ferraro said she probably would have to have a pin put in each one. There is a chance she could come back.'' Brave Raj, who was bought for $300,000 by Dolly Green in May, is one of the favorites to win an Eclipse Award as the nation's top 2-year-old filly in 1986. . . . George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, will be in Miami today to watch his newly turned 3-year-old gelding Uncle Cam race in the Tropical Park Derby, the first Kentucky Derby prep of the year. Uncle Cam, a winner of three straight in Florida, has yet to run against top horses in his age group but is the 5-2 morning-line favorite.\nSPORTS PEOPLE

576	NASA Reached '73 Thiokol Decision Objectively	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD81530F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: To the Editor:\nTo the Editor:\nIn an article (front page, Dec. 8) and an editorial (''The Past in the Shuttle's Future,'' Dec. 9), you have reported, stimulated and supported the outrageous canard that James C. Fletcher, director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who was the agency's administrator from 1971 to 1977, awarded the contract for the space shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets in 1973 to the Thiokol Corporation because of pro-Utah bias. This accusation not only unjustly impugns the motives and reputation of a fine man, an honest and good public servant, but it also happens to be untrue.\nI know. As NASA's associate administrator for organization and management, I shared in making the final decision, along with George Low, deputy administrator (now deceased) and Jim Fletcher.\nNASA's process for evaluating competing proposals and selecting the winner is regulated by rules to compel objectivity and eliminate bias. In particular, selection officials are not involved in choosing the evaluating teams.\nIn the case of the booster-rockets competition, the source evaluation -done after study by some hundreds of experts drawn from five NASA centers, NASA headquarters and the Army, Navy and Air Force, and scored by an evaluation board of 11 -indicated that three of the proposers rated essentially even in mission suitability, and that the fourth proposal (that of Aerojet, the only proposer, incidentally, of a nonsegmented booster) was ranked significantly lower in suitability and didn't offer any cost advantage over the others. It was also indicated that Thiokol's likely cost advantage over the others was significant in every area.\nAfter the reports had been studied, and their authors interrogated at length, and after NASA's key people had stated their views from their respective areas of responsibility, Jim Fletcher, Mr. Low and I met in private to review the evidence and make the decision.\nI remember volunteering that, faced with essentially a standoff in indicated mission suitability, I favored Thiokol because of the indicated lower cost. Mr. Low concurred, though noting that recent awards had put a lot on Thiokol's plate, and we needed to make sure that Thiokol devoted the necessary resources to our project. Jim Fletcher, who up to that point had vigorously questioned the participants but had not expressed any conclusions, said O.K., but the selection statement must mention the desirability of ultimately having a second source when boosters were required in quantity, or words to that effect. All of us signed the statement.\nI don't remember anything about a Utah connection being mentioned or considered. Neither George Low nor I had any Utah involvement. In short, it was not Jim Fletcher's Utah background that figured in the decision, but the collection of objective factors in the four proposals on which the decision had to be made.\nHaving worked closely with Jim Fletcher on Apollo, shuttle, planetary and other scientific projects, budget battles and other tasks, I know him to be a person of great moral integrity, objective to a fault and devoted to the public good. His current job, which he did not seek, is hard enough without forcing him to endure baseless and irresponsible insinuations. He has done nothing that disqualifies him from participating in decisions on booster-rocket design for the future, and he should not disqualify himself from doing so. For you to suggest that by the source-selection decision made in 1973 he ''set the course for last January's fiery shipwreck'' is not up to the level of comment that one expects from you.\nRICHARD C. MCCURDY\nDarien, Conn., Dec. 12, 1986
577	Mental-Health System Shouldn't Be a Dump for the Dangerous	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D71530F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: To the Editor:\nTo the Editor:\nI would like to add a point to your report that some states are changing their laws to make it easier to commit the mentally ill for involuntary treatment (Science Times, Dec. 9). I believe there is conflict over commitment laws largely because they serve two widely disparate social objectives. The first is to provide humane treatment for psychotic patients. The second, less acknowledged but unfortunately widely practiced, is to commit potentially dangerous people who have little or no mental illness because the legal system does not provide any other mechanism to protect society from them. As you quote Steven J. Schwartz, a lawyer who has defended mental-patient rights, ''Even criminals can get a lawyer and see a judge,'' which means, that unless a crime has been committed, the legal system is impotent to protect society from an individual widely perceived as dangerous.\nCivil-rights advocates have been very effective in protecting the liberty interests of potentially dangerous people. However noble their objectives, there remains the pragmatic problem of what to do with someone who is perceived as dangerous but not necessarily mentally ill. Perhaps this is the real issue that society and the legal system need to address. The mental-health system should not be involved with people who are behavior problems but not mentally ill. Psychiatrists and allied mental-health professions could then provide effective treatment to the mentally ill, including appropriate committal. Behavior problems could be dealt with by the courts. This might require legal recourse to preventive detention, and civil-rights advocates would object. However, the issue should be debated directly without involving mental illness in it. Society apparently needs a way of dealing with the potentially dangerous, and commitment laws are now the only mechanism.\nThe present system of dealing with dangerous people through the mental-health system does a disservice to the mentally ill. The average mentally ill person is no more dangerous than the average citizen, although this is not the general impression. Using commitment laws to detain dangerous people perpetuates this misperception. The average former convict is much more likely to commit a future crime than the average psychiatric patient. Further, the mentally ill are often deprived of humane treatment because of others' concerns about their civil rights.\nFinally, a separate issue is the right to treatment of the mentally ill. As you point out, the New York State Court of Appeals has ruled that a patient, committed or not, cannot be treated with medication against his or her will except in emergency without a judicial decision. This decision was to insure a patient's ''liberty interests.'' However, people may also have a right to enjoy freedom from psychosis. Civil liberties are difficult to appreciate in a psychotic state. As Dr. Siegel and Dr. Schwarz of the Beth Israel Medical Center stated in the Area II American Psychiatric Association Bulletin for September-October 1986, ''Freedom from psychosis is more consistent with liberty than freedom from medication.''\nJOHN H. BEAMER, M.D.\nPotsdam, N.Y., Dec. 10, 1986\nThe writer, a psychiatrist, is clinical director of the St. Lawrence County Mental Health Clinic.

There is, however, a new note to the award this year that should bring shame, not pride, to our Government: for the first time in history, Nobel Prize awards will be taxed by the United States Government.\nBecause of the tax-reform act of 1986, section 74 of the Internal Revenue Code has been revised to tax any award for scientific or artistic achievement, with the exceptions only of prizes that are assigned to a governmental unit or to a tax-exempt charity.\nIn a country of more than 100 million taxpayers, can't we leave an award of such prestige as this untaxed? It amounts to much less than a penny per taxpayer. And then, the recipient can continue in his or her work with a feeling that all Americans are sharing in the award, that this is truly a case of shared national pride.\nSEYMOUR LAURETZ\nSanta Monica, Calif., Dec. 22, 1986\nThe writer is a certified public accountant.

First, these trials were not undertaken overseas to avoid U.S. regulations. They were undertaken in Argentina because outbreaks of bovine rabies there cause losses of $50 million a year.\nSecond, to suggest that the vaccine may ''become more virulent'' (editorial) is fearmongering. The vaccinia virus has been known since Edward Jenner first used it and was cultivated in numerous passages in cattle for production of the lymph vaccine without evidence of its becoming more virulent. There is no evidence that any of the numerous other vaccinia recombinants have become more virulent.\nThe campaign to attack the trial ex post facto was initiated by an Argentine trainee working at the Wistar Institute who had no scientific knowledge about vaccinia virus and its effect on humans and cattle. Nor did he confirm his interpretation with anyone knowledgeable about the experiment before writing a denunciatory letter to the Argentine Government.\nThe reaction within Argentina and the U.S. has been tantamount to a campaign of vilification of the Wistar Institute and the Pan American Health Organization, in whose facilities the trial was conducted. Forgotten are the potential economic benefits to the Argentine cattle industry and the paradoxical fact that the campaign against the trial started after ''the evaluation [ of the results ] did not confirm the existence of risks'' (editorial, La Nacion, Buenos Aires, Nov.\nHILARY KOPROWSKI, M.D.\nDirector, The Wistar Institute\nPhiladelphia, Dec. 8, 1986

As the panel chairman, Daniel Federman, stated in the preface to the report: ''Many social circumstances are closely related to the problem of teen-age pregnancy and childbearing. Youth unemployment, poverty, poor education, single-parent families, television content. The hope for a solution to the problem of teen-age pregnancy is illusory without simultaneous amelioration of some of these contributing factors. Pending such comprehensive change, the panel urges prevention rather than denial, kindness rather than exhortation and research rather than doctrine.''\nThe panel recommended a wide range of research and programs directed toward improving school achievement and job placement, in order to expand opportunities for disadvantaged youth.\nJOY G.

581	New Kitchenware for a Healthy New Year	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D81230F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Resolutions for the New Year, no doubt, included a promise to eat more responsibly, to replace the fried chicken with baked chicken, the ice cream at midnight with carrot sticks, the grilled salmon and beurre blanc with plain grilled fish. Those were the resolutions, but what are you doing about them?\nResolutions for the New Year, no doubt, included a promise to eat more responsibly, to replace the fried chicken with baked chicken, the ice cream at midnight with carrot sticks, the grilled salmon and beurre blanc with plain grilled fish. Those were the resolutions, but what are you doing about them?\nThe word for 1987 is that you can have it all and still be adult about your diet. Just set aside some of the Christmas gift money for a few pieces of new kitchen equipment. This year's popular new appliances are not deep fat fryers or Belgian waffle makers. They are nonstick pans, pint-size food processors, trouble-free pressure cookers and, best of all, an up-to-date version of the soda fountain milkshake maker.\nWhat brought this equipment to mind was the arrival in my kitchen of the nifty little electric machine appropriately called Shakemaker, though the manufacturer is talking of renaming it Slimshake or Slimshaker in deference to the nutrition-conscious public. The Shakemaker, manufactured by Donvier, produces milkshakes that don't have a bit of fat and that seem almost as creamy and rich as those made with ice cream. Filling, too. I have been playing with mine for 10 days and have started drinking milk again. Skim milk, at that - what my children used to call blue milk because of its color.\nAll you need to do to satisfy your desire for something seemingly rich and slightly sweet is put three-quarters of a cup of skim milk in the shaker container, put it in the freezer for 10 minutes, add the flavorings, process with the motorized top for 20 seconds, and presto! You have a midnight snack that will not play havoc with your diet - 100 to 150 calories for a mixture that contains coffee powder, a teaspoon of sugar or orange juice concentrate, and two teaspoons of plain low-fat yogurt. Of course you can make the shakes with ice cream, but that is another matter.\nThe recipe book that comes with the Shakemaker suggests using low-calorie sweeteners, but I prefer to add 16 calories' worth of sugar (one teaspoon) when I need sweetening.\nThe Shakemaker is available at Bloomingdale's for $34.95 and at Macy's Herald Square for $29.99.\nAfter listening for months to commercials for Oskar, the pint-size food processor designed for people with small apartments, or who don't like to cook much or who think a full-size food processor is too complicated, I was still not convinced.\nBut when it was suggested that it offered an especially quick, easy way to puree vegetables for thickening sauces, it seemed to fit the criteria for healthful appliances. And is it fast! It makes carrot slices into puree in the flick of an eye. So if you want tasty sauces for broiled fish or chicken without using cream or butter, put this little dynamo to work.\nIt is almost as quick at shredding and slicing, making it easy to stir-fry vegetables, and it cleans up in a jiffy.\nThe Oskar Food Processor is $64.99 at Macy's Herald Square; $64.95 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (at 80th Street); $69.95 at Columbus Avenue General Store, 207 Columbus Avenue (at 70th Street), and $69.99 at 1st Stop Housewares, 1025 Second Avenue (near 54th Street).\nI operated my first pressure cooker when I was 10 years old, so it was difficult to convince me that there could be any advances in pressure cooker technology that would make a new one worth the money.\nBut in fact the one that Cuisinarts calls a pressure cooker-steamer is a great improvement over the old version: The cook no longer has to fiddle with the flame interminably to keep the pressure constant.\nAs with any pressure cooker, this one retains the vitamins, minerals and natural flavor of food better than other methods, and it uses very little water. Almost as attractive is the fact that this cooker can be opened immediately, without waiting for the pressure gauge to go down by itself.\nI tried a whole 4 1/2-pound chicken in the cooker, first browning it and then cooking it under pressure for 30 minutes. Even though I seasoned it with nothing but the cup of chicken broth in which it was cooked - no carrots, no onions, no salt - and removed the skin before eating, the chicken was as succulent as any I have ever tasted.\nThis is not an inexpensive piece of equipment, but people who like stews or soups and don't have the patience or time to cook them in the regular way will find plenty of use for this handsome pot.\nThe current pamphlet of recipes enclosed with the pot is a bit thin, but a card in each box entitles the recipient to send away for the more definitive booklet, which will be available at the end of January.\nThe Cuisinart Quiet Pressure Cooker/Steamer comes in three sizes: 4, 6 and 8 quarts at suggested retail prices of $150, $165 and $180. At Macy's Herald Square the 6-quart cooker is $165, and at Columbus Avenue General Store it is $149.95; at 1st Stop Houswares the 4-quart cooker is $150.\nOne other piece of equipment that has been around much longer than these but is equally useful for healthful cooking is the nonstick skillet.\nThe coating, as everyone already knows, makes it possible to cook with next to no fat, but as professional chefs have discovered just a little fat for flavor and browning makes it possible to achieve an attractive product as well as one that tastes as good as anything cooked in a quarter of a cup of butter. There are many coated skillets of various quality: the Silverstone-coated Bourgeat pans from France are extremely well made.\nDean & DeLuca, 12 Prince Street, near Wooster Street, sells the 11 1/2-inch Bourgeat Silverstone skillet for $58; it is $65.99 at Expression Unltd., 165 Washington Valley Road, Warren N.J.\nDE GUSTIBUS

583	The Funds Try Personal Touch	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DE1030F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: MUTUAL funds have traditionally been bought and sold via the telephone and the mails. But many of the big fund managers, particularly those that sell the ''no-load,'' or commissionless, variety, are opening walk-in offices, where the public can obtain literature, ask questions - and buy the company's funds.\nMUTUAL funds have traditionally been bought and sold via the telephone and the mails. But many of the big fund managers, particularly those that sell the ''no-load,'' or commissionless, variety, are opening walk-in offices, where the public can obtain literature, ask questions - and buy the company's funds.\nFidelity Investments, which has 38 of these offices around the country, opened a large street-floor Investor Center on Park Avenue in New York late last year. The Dreyfus Corporation, with six Personal Financial Centers in the New York metropolitan area, will open 25 deposit centers at Bank of New York branches and other key locations this month. T. Rowe Price, Scudder Stevens & Clark, Vanguard, Stein Roe & Farnham and Calvert are among the other fund organizations with offices open to customers and potential customers.\nIn addition, some fund management companies are sharing space. For example, the Financial Information Centers of America leased space last year at a Fort Worth shopping center, and then subleased it to about 40 financial institutions, including funds, Three similar centers at malls in other cities are scheduled to open during the next four months.\n''It's a trend that has been developing,'' said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, which analyzes mutual funds. ''It started with money market funds in the very early 80's and broadened out since then with those who were strong in equity funds. Most people in this country are now used to getting information orally, rather than through reading.''\nNot all of the investment centers have succeeded. Fidelity, for instance, participated in a group experiment in a supermarket that was discontinued because of inadequate volume. And the 20-year-old Merrill Lynch Investment Information Center in New York's Grand Central Terminal closed this week when its lease expired.\nNevertheless, there appears to be sufficient public interest in on-site consultations with knowledgeable advisers to support the continued development of mutual fund centers. And with some fund companies also becoming active in discount brokerage, where the personal touch may be helpful, industry leaders indicate that the size and scope of such centers are likely to grow in the years ahead.\n''There are certain people who feel very comfortable getting on the phone or putting money in the mail,'' said Howard Stein, chairman of Dreyfus. ''But some people need some guidance as to what to do with the explosion of choices you have today.''\nEdward C. Johnson 3d, chairman of Fidelity, said: ''A lot of people like to sit down and develop a personal relationship with an individual at a center. They want to 'kick the tires' and see what the organization is like.''\nPart of the reason for the widening attention being given to centers by fund companies is the rising competition with other segments of the financial services business. ''Direct marketing people with no-loads are competing more and more with broker-distributed products,'' said James S. Riepe, director of the mutual funds division at T. Rowe Price Associates, which plans to open its first center in Los Angeles this year.\nThere is a tendency, moreover, to situate these mutual fund centers - at least the first ones opened by an organization - in its home territory. Thus Vanguard has two centers in the Philadelphia area, Calvert has two in Washington, D.C., and Stein Roe & Farnham has one in Chicago.\n''We found there are literally thousands of people in Chicago that take advantage of this location,'' said Marshal B. Front, executive vice president of Stein Roe.

A weaker dollar makes American products cheaper abroad.

Others, like the statewide ban on the use of sulfites to preserve fresh fruits and vegetables, affect just about everybody.\nAll the new consumer laws were passed by the state Senate and Assembly in the 1986 legislative session and have been signed by Governor Cuomo. Most have already gone into effect; the others will take effect at various times from now until 1988.\nPerhaps the most highly publicized new law was an amendment to New York's ''lemon law,'' which was enacted in 1983. The original law was intended to help consumers get refunds or replacements in cases where a new car turned out to be a lemon.\nThe amendment, which took effect Aug. 2, extends the law to leased cars where the lease requires the consumer to pay for repairs. The amendment also created an independent arbitration program. Previously, the automobile makers had set up their own arbitration programs to resolve consumer complaints, which had led some consumer advocates to compare the process to a fox guarding a henhouse.\nThe new state laws are more concerned with motor vehicles than with any other consumer product or service.\nAll-terrain vehicles, for example, must be registered in 1987, and their owners must pay sales and use taxes at the time of registration. In addition, operators of all-terrain vehicles are required to have liability insurance.\nShops in New York City that sell parts from junked cars must now be licensed with the city's Consumer Affairs Department, which means that consumers with complaints can turn to the department to resolve them.\nIn a setback for advocates of the metric system, the state eliminated its requirement that speedometers on cars manufactured after Sept. 1, 1980, register speeds in both miles and kilometers per hour.\nShops that rustproof automobiles are now required to guarantee their work for five years, no if's or but's. The law was designed to prevent stratagems some rustproofers had used to void guarantees.\nAll school buses in the state are now required to have seat belts.\nAnother highly publicized new law was the ''toxic torts bill,'' which gives people who have been harmed by five toxic substances until July 29 to revive their legal claims for damages by filing lawsuits.\nThe law was designed to help people who discovered after the statute of limitations had run out that they had been harmed by the five substances - diethyl stilbestrol (DES), asbestos, chlordane, tungsten-carbide or polyvinylchloride (PVC).\nFor similar cases in the future, the new law enables people to sue for personal injury or property damage for up to three years after their discovery of an injury from any harmful substance. Previously, when people developed health problems long after their exposure to a harmful substance, it was often too late under the statute of limitations to sue.\nAmong other health-related laws is one that prohibits selling over-the-counter drugs after the expiration date given on the package.\nPatients have also been given broader access to documents concerning their care and treatment.\nThe laws reflect the diversity of consumer concerns and complaints.\nFor instance, some consumers may be heartened to learn that information disclosed in any polygraph examinations they have taken can no longer be used to deny them credit.\nCompanies that promise to improve credit ratings must tell their clients how they could do so on their own.\nBicycles manufactured after Jan. 1, 1989, must bear a serial number and anyone caught scratching the number off can be fined up to $250.\nConsumers who sign up for dating services can now specify how far they would be willing to travel for a date.\nStores that rent televisions and other products through rent-to-buy plans cannot charge more than twice the ticket price.\nAn amendment to the penal law makes it illegal for computer users to tap into other people's computers without authorization.\nRockland County businesses that sue consumers must say in court papers whether or not they are licensed, and if they do not give this information to the person they are suing he or she can move to dismiss the suit.\nThe New York State Consumer Protection Board has a booklet, ''1986 Legislative Wrap-Up,'' that summarizes all the consumer laws passed this year. It is free to anyone who sends a postcard requesting it to the New York State Consumer Protection Board, P.O. Box 6, 1 Commerce Plaza, Albany, N.Y. 12260.\nSATURDAY CONSUMER

The purchase was simple and the contacts were inexpensive.\nWhen Tara Bowman decided to switch to contact lenses after 10 years of wearing eyeglasses, she shopped for convenience and bought a pair of soft lenses from a discount optical store near her office. The purchase was simple and the contacts were inexpensive.\nBut before long, Ms. Bowman felt a scratchy feeling on one of her eyes -as if there was dust under the lens, she said.\nWhen she returned to the store, she was told not to worry.\n''They said that a lot of people feel discomfort or have trouble adjusting to their first pair of soft lenses,'' Ms. Bowman recalled. ''They certainly didn't examine my eye to see if there was something under the lens.''\nDuring the next year, Ms. Bowman bought four more pairs of contacts from the discount store, yet the irritation continued. Finally, she gave up and went to a private optometrist, who gave her an optical examination and found that the brand of lens she was wearing was incompatible with her eyes.\nHer experience is not uncommon among today's approximately 18 million contact lens wearers, who are faced - or blessed - with a variety of contacts to choose from and a variety of outlets that sell them. Soft lenses in particular are becoming easily available, and the options as to types can be bewildering. A Wide-Open Market\nAt one time, soft lenses could be purchased only through private practitioners, and only at very high prices. When the Food and Drug Administration first approved soft lenses in 1971, a typical pair cost several hundred dollars, and one manufacturer - Bausch & Lomb -produced almost all the country's lenses.\nThe market has split wide open in the last several years, profoundly altering both prices and buying patterns. Nearly 100 companies now manufacture soft lenses, and a 1977 Supreme Court decision allowing doctors to advertise has spurred a price war in soft lens sales. It is now possible to get a pair, depending on where you are and what kind of package you purchase, for as little as $15.\nAt the same time, thousands of neighborhood discount contact lens ''clinics'' and chain stores - among the largest are Pearle Vision, Sterling Optical and Sears Optical - have sprung up around the country, and now account for some 15 to 20 percent of the market in eye care.\nAlthough all soft lenses on the market have been approved by the F.D.A., ''there are some differences between the lenses provided by the different companies,'' said Dr. David Haight, an ophthalmologist who is acting director of a contact lens clinic at Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. ''There is price variability - the most inexpensive are the ones available in 'one-size-fits-all.' '' Discount Stores for 'Easy Fits'\nIn general, ophthalmologists and optometrists who are in private practice say discount stores are acceptable for patients who have bought contacts before and who have uncomplicated prescriptions and healthy eyes.\n''Many of these places can serve those people who are 'easy fits,' '' Dr. Haight said. ''The problem is, until you go to a doctor you don't know if you're an easy fit or not.''\nDiscount store operators say that the stores' convenient locations, low prices and flexible hours - many are open evenings and weekends - have infused the industry with healthy competition and have been a boon to consumers.\n''We've made contact lenses affordable to people who couldn't afford them in the past,'' said Linda Landers, a vice president of America's Best Contacts and Eyeglasses, a chain with more than 30 branches in a number of states. 'Advantage Is Convencience'\nDr. Mike Simons, a vice president at Pearle Health Services, which owns about 900 Pearle Vision Centers nationwide, said: ''The real advantage to the consumer is convenience. That's how Pearle has created a niche for itself.''\nMany private practitioners, though, contend that the discount outlets care more about profits than patients. Customers are being bilked into buying ill-fitting, uncomfortable contacts, they say, and, more seriously, are getting care that is cursory at best.\n''The ordinary complaints I get are that the lenses fit so poorly that the patient is constantly uncomfortable, can't see, or has miserable-looking eyes filled with secretions,'' said Dr. Jay L. Klessman, a Washington optometrist.\nAlthough procedures vary widely from store to store, even among different branches of the same chain, discount stores generally have at least one in-house optometrist to do eye exams and write prescriptions. In some stores, customers say, eye exams take less than 10 minutes and many crucial tests are omitted.\nOther contact lens users are pleased with discount outlets. William Rocco, a Washington resident who had worn soft lenses for several years, went to one such store after he lost a contact and realized his insurance policy had lapsed.\nHe purchased two pairs of lenses for just $39, and says he has had no trouble with them. ''I needed contacts, and I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money,'' he said. ''I probably saved $150.''

But while many women may look their best with just a dusting of blusher and a stroke of lipstick, others need the cloak of more concealing cosmetics designed to erase reality.\nIncreasingly, cosmetics companies have been developing products to meet these special needs. The market has grown in recent years to include makeup for men and women troubled by disfiguring birthmarks, pigmentation problems, burns, scars and bruises after plastic surgery.\nSuch makeup can help victims of violent crime. Last June, the face of a model, Marla Hanson, was slashed with a razor. After surgery, cosmetics helped to conceal the scars.\nThese products are not only cover-ups for the face, but conceal varicose veins, so-called age spots on the hands and even stretch marks on the torso or legs. These skin-tone foundations are thick, opaque, waterproof and long-wearing. They cling to scar tissue, which is slick and difficult to cover. Several New Products\nEsteem, a new company, offers fragrance-free foundations, color cosmetics, skin-care products, eye shadows and a mild alcohol-free shampoo.\nThe line is sold by the company at 201 East 69th Street, New York, N.Y. l0021. Its telephone number is 212-4l8-65ll. On Tuesday mornings the company offers free makeup-application classes to patients of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary Facial Plastics Clinic. Company representatives offer consultations to patients at physicians' offices.\nEsteem joins a list of established companies offering an ever-expanding number of concealing creams. Probably the oldest product on the market is Covermark, an opaque cream made by Lydia O'Leary and introduced about 50 years ago. More recently, a stick and crayon form of the product were introduced. A product for the legs will be introduced in March.\nCover Creme, which was introduced three years ago by Dermablend Corrective Cosmetics, is a similar type of concealer available in a cream form. Last summer, the company introduced Leg Cover, a concealer for larger areas of the body. Soft Touch, a powder to soften the finish of the skin and add a hint of color, will be introduced this month.\nClinique, which is a larger cosmetics company and is geared to a general market, offers Continuous Coverage, a thick, opaque liquid.\nPrices for corrective foundations range from $9.50 for l.2 ounces of Continuous Coverage to $22.50 for one-half ounce of Esteem's Totally Perfect Cover-Up.\nManufacturers say conventional makeup products hide skin flaws, but not all provide the coverage and consistency needed to adhere to scar tissue and conceal dark bruises. And most are not free of fragrance, the culprit behind many adverse reactions. This can be particularly important after corrective surgery.\nCompanies advise getting a physician's approval before using the cosmetics. Surgeons generally recommend waiting 48 hours after sutures are removed before applying makeup, which should not touch suture areas until they have healed. Skin that has been abraded to erase wrinkles or acne scars, for example, should not be covered with makeup until it is well healed, which takes about two weeks, according to Dr. Gary S. Bromley, an attending plastic surgeon at the New York Infirmary-Beekman Downtown Hospital. Peggy Skinner, executive director of the Burn Foundation in Augusta, Ga., who is Esteem's director of patient services, advises testing a facial cosmetic on a small area of the face before applying it more widely. Certain products have not been tested on postoperative skin before marketing, according to manufacturers.\nPhysicians and makeup artists have found that the relief provided by these products is psychological as much as physical. ''They can reduce the telltale signs of surgery and get the person back to relatively normal activities earlier than would ordinarily be possible,'' said Dr. Sherrell J. Aston, associate professsor of plastic surgery at the New York University School of Medicine. Makeup Boosts Self-Confidence\nIn many cases, specialists say, a covering of makeup often gives a person the self-confidence needed to confront the world without the sting of self-consciousness or embarrassment. David Nicholas, a cosmetician who is a volunteer at the makeup clinic at the Shriners Burns Institute, a hospital in Boston, recalls applying makeup to the legs of a girl who was severely burned from the waist down when she was 7 years old.\n''She's l7 now and she hadn't worn a dress in 10 years or gone to a school dance,'' he said. ''She became a recluse in her own little world. After I applied Covermark to cover the discoloration of the burn and recommended opaque nylons to cover the disfiguration, you'd never know she had a problem. She called me recently. She told me she went out and bought a dress. She wore it to her school dance.''

607	INVESTMENT BANKERS GO WEST	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DB1F30F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Because American corporations are more willing to switch from one investment banking firm to another, the investment bankers are scrambling to find new customers - and keep old ones - by setting up shop far from the canyons of Wall Street.\nBecause American corporations are more willing to switch from one investment banking firm to another, the investment bankers are scrambling to find new customers - and keep old ones - by setting up shop far from the canyons of Wall Street.\nNowhere has this been more true than in Chicago, which in recent years has firmly established itself as the nation's Second City in investment banking. Indeed, by some estimates, the number of investment banking professionals in Chicago has soared to 250, twice what it was in 1980 - but still just a fraction of the number in New York.\n''The firms are trying to move investment bankers closer to their customers, rather than have all their people in New York,'' said Perrin Long, who follows the securities industry for Lipper Analytical Services. ''That makes it easier for them to develop relationships, to get out to the golf course with a potential client, to go for a drink after work.'' Traditional Ties Weaken\nThis decentralization has gathered momentum as the traditional ties between corporation and investment banker have weakened: Companies are turning increasingly to whichever firm has developed the best new financial products to meet their needs. And as these investment banks churn out more new products than ever before, they find they need hordes of marketing people from coast to coast to tell companies how the latest products can help them.\n''It used to be that to help your customers you had to be in New York, because that was the place to access the capital markets,'' said Leonard S. Caronia, a senior vice president in the First Chicago Corporation's investment banking operations. ''But today, you can access the markets from anywhere, so what drives the investment banking business today is being close to your customers.''\nIndustry experts say that since Chicago has such heavyweights as Sears, McDonald's, Amoco, Beatrice, the Pritzkers and the options and futures exchanges, it is no surprise that many of New York's investment banking firms have made it their second city. Analysts say Boston is in third place in investment banking, Los Angeles in fourth.\n''Outside of the New York City area, the largest concentration of major companies is within the 300 miles east from Milwaukee through Chicago to Detroit,'' said E. David Coolidge 3d, head of corporate finance at William Blair & Company, the largest Chicago-based investment banking firm. 'Great City'\nEdgar D. Jannotta, Blair's managing partner, added that Chicago is a ''great city for investment banking'' because it has a stable, broad-based commercial and industrial community. ''We don't have the ups and downs of the oil patch in Texas or the high-tech sector on the West Coast,'' he said.\nMerrill Lynch & Company has expanded its investment banking presence here to 28 professionals, from 15 in 1985. And First Boston has 22 investment bankers here, up from five in 1982. Kidder, Peabody; Shearson Lehman, Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley have also beefed up their Chicago staffs.\nWhat is more, the First National Bank of Chicago, the city's largest bank, is making a major effort to attract investment banking business, doing interest rate swaps, Eurobond offerings and even some merger and acquisition work. In addition, New York's commercial banking giants, such like Citicorp, are trying to grab a piece of the Middle West's investment banking pie.\n''Geographic proximity enables you to get to your clients and prospects better and to gain more knowledge of the local market and industries,'' said Randolph Lyon, head of First Boston's Chicago office. ''It's harder to do that out of New York.''\nMr. Lyon said that in 1982 First Boston made a strategic decision to decentralize its investment banking operation and in doing so, set up its second-largest American office in Chicago. ''We saw some of our competitors had already done this, and we couldn't help but notice that they had been very successful,'' Mr. Lyon added. 'We Had the Lead'\nGoldman, Sachs & Company has had an investment banking presence in Chicago since 1900. ''Until the 1960's, we had the lead, and everybody else was playing catch-up,'' said James P. Gorter, a senior partner who heads Goldman's Chicago office.\nSalomon Brothers Inc. started giving Goldman heavy competition in 1969, when it started an investment banking operation in Chicago by hiring J. Ira Harris away from a local firm. Mr. Harris rose to prominence in the 1970's through a flurry of deals, including Beatrice's acquisition of Coca-Cola Bottling of Los Angeles, Loews's purchase of CNA and Esmark's takeover of International Playtex.\n''People in the Midwest prefer to be covered locally, as long as the services they receive are equal to what they get by being served out of New York,'' Mr. Harris said.\nIn recent years, everyone has tried to steal business from Goldman and Salomon. They do that by repeatedly calling on companies, learning what their problems are and explaining how different investment banking products can help them. They often suggest Eurobond offerings, initial public offerings, or takeover targets.\n''We have an identified prospect list,'' said R. Kimble Brooker, head of Morgan Stanley's Chicago office. ''We make idea-oriented calls with considerable regularity. We also think entertainment is important to develop business and relationships.''\nMost corporate officials like this expanded investment banking presence. ''The Chicago presence helps because it gives them a better idea of what we're thinking and what we're trying to accomplish,'' said Jack Greenberg, chief financial officer at the McDonald's Corporation. ''It gives them more opportunity to come to us with ideas. The Chicago people are the funnel of new ideas.''\nAnd James M. Denny, vice president of finance for Sears, Roebuck & Company, noted: ''What corporate financial officers often do is reward innovation of particular investment banks by giving them a certain piece of business.'' 'It's Nice to Know'\nAnother advantage comes when Chicago executives want advice on a pressing problem. ''It's nice to know I can just walk down the street to see my investment banker,'' said Patrick G. Ryan, chief executive of the Combined International Corporation. ''You have to have confidence in the advice and ability of your firm, and that generally stems from mutual understanding of one another. Developing that kind of relationship requires proximity.''\nFor years, Donald P. Kelly, now the chairman of Beatrice, but formerly Esmark's chairman, had breakfast twice a week with Salomon's Ira Harris to kick around ideas. One day, Mr. Kelly said he was interested in buying a consumer products company, and Mr. Harris soon arranged for Mr. Kelly's company to buy International Playtex. This fall, Mr. Harris informed Mr. Kelly that Borden Inc. was interested in Beatrice's dairy division, which made Hotel Bar butter and Meadow Gold ice cream.\n''I had originally taken the position that I didn't want to sell it,'' Mr. Kelly said. But he said advice from his longtime investment banker, Mr. Harris, had persuaded him to take the offer seriously - and in November, he sold Beatrice's dairy division to Borden for $315 million. ''Ira had the resources to do the deal without a lot of strain,'' Mr. Kelly said.\nSalomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley and several other firms execute many of their deals in Chicago. The Morgan Stanley office executes its securities issues and private placements, but leaves most merger and acquisition execution for New York to do. ''The advantage of having people execute on site is it makes them better bankers when the next relationship comes,'' said Morgan's Mr. Brooker. ''But on the M. & A. side, it is such a fast-moving game that there is a lot of merit to having it centralized in one place.'' Goldman's New York Specialists\nIn contrast, Goldman executes all its deals in New York. ''By its nature, a regional office has to be smaller, and the people have to be generalists,'' said Mr. Gorter of Goldman. ''If you had specialists to execute, they might have to call in New York specialists anyway. And specialists could get out of the flow in regional offices - they wouldn't be talking with their peers all the time about the latest ideas.''\nThe mushrooming number of investment bankers in Chicago has caused some talk of a shakeout, especially amid predictions that merger activity will slow. ''The hot investment banking business in Chicago has been the restructuring of Midwestern industrial companies, but we're at the tail end of that,'' said First Chicago's Mr. Caronia. ''Longer term, I think the big business will be financings.''\nAs competition has intensified, many companies have begun pursuing niches, such as utilities, transportation or medium-sized companies.\n''It's definitely more competitive than it was,'' said Mr. Jannotta of William Blair. ''Whereas we once competed with Chicago firms, many of which have fallen by the wayside, now we're competing against a strong presence from New York.''

Fewer than 40 remain unresolved, according to a spokesman.\nWhen the settlement becomes final, after a 30-day comment period and a public hearing, Shell is to pay $20 million for refiner-pricing issues. It will be distributed by the Energy Department under a special refund proceeding in which those victimized may press claims. Another $160 million, reflecting crude-oil-pricing issues, would be divided between the Treasury and the states after 20 percent is reserved for the special proceeding.\nThe company said in a statement that the levies, which were neither fines nor penalties, resulted from differing interpretations of complex Federal regulations. It added that it had agreed to pay the money to avoid further prolonged litigation and to remove uncertainties.

And even in the world of commercial pop-funk music, his recent electronic ''hip-hop'' records have demonstrated a textural ingenuity, wit and rhythmic bite that surpass the normal run of dance music. During Mr. Hancock's club engagement this past week at the Blue Note (131 West Third Street), where he led an all-star quartet, one was reminded once again of his sweeping keyboard mastery.\nFor this rare club appearance, Mr. Hancock was joined by Branford Marsalis on tenor saxophone, Ron Carter on bass and Al Foster on drums. Mr. Marsalis, who recently worked with Sting and put out an album of light classical music, is a sympathetic partner for Mr. Hancock, since they share a freewheeling jazz eclecticism that scrutinizes songs from a perspective that scrambles styles as it takes a long view of jazz history. Mr. Hancock's evenhanded keyboard dynamics are well matched by Mr. Marsalis's very smooth but precise intonation and fondness for long instrumental lines.\nThursday's early show opened with a ''Limehouse Blues'' propelled by popping polyrhythms shared by the sax, bass and drums. Mr. Carter's Brazilian-flavored ''Loose Change,'' which followed, began as a bossa nova bass solo that Mr. Marsalis heated up with clear, trilling solos and Mr. Hancock cooled by gently strumming the piano strings. The quartet's ''Old Devil Moon'' became a churning cycle of interlocking solos, highlighted by Mr. Marsalis's forceful tweedling embellishments. Ken Dorham's ''Fair Weather,'' from the score of ''Round Midnight,'' became the set's cool reflective resting point. ''Just One of Those Things,'' a genially upbeat display of Latin fireworks, concluded a multistyled, continuously absorbing musical encounter.
610	OPERA: ALTMEYER IN 'FIDELIO' AT MET	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D81F30F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In recent seasons the Metropolitan Opera has upgraded the quality of its ''cover,'' or substitute, singers, but to have Jeannine Altmeyer, one of our leading Brunhildes and Isoldes, covering for Hildegard Behrens as Leonore in ''Fidelio'' seems downright luxurious. Ms. Altmeyer sang her one scheduled performance of the part Thursday night, although she had actually sung the role for the first time at the Met on Dec.\nIn recent seasons the Metropolitan Opera has upgraded the quality of its ''cover,'' or substitute, singers, but to have Jeannine Altmeyer, one of our leading Brunhildes and Isoldes, covering for Hildegard Behrens as Leonore in ''Fidelio'' seems downright luxurious. Ms. Altmeyer sang her one scheduled performance of the part Thursday night, although she had actually sung the role for the first time at the Met on Dec. 17 when she stepped in for an indisposed Ms. Behrens.\nMs. Altmeyer had a stomach virus herself on Thursday, an announcement said. She had a few pitch problems in ''Komm, Hoffnung,'' and struggled a bit at the very top, but perhaps those minor troubles were unrelated to her illness. In any event, Ms. Altmeyer has a pleasing voice, for all its considerable size more softly feminine in tone and inflection than one usually encounters in this opera. And she moves onstage with little effort at masculine impersonation, which looked odd here and there.\nShe also mouths consonants too much: in their second-act duet, her Florestan, Edward Sooter, consistently articulated the word ''Freude'' while Ms. Altmeyer answered with a blast of pure vowel tone. Still, this was a committed, affecting performance by a major singer.\nThe other casting novelty was the Don Fernando of Richard J. Clark, his first at the Met. Mr. Clark sang routinely and looked sillier and more sticklike than most singers of this cardboard character. But the blame must be assigned primarily to Beethoven and secondarily to Mr. Clark's costumer and wigmaker. The rest of the cast offered Marie McLaughlin, Barry McCauley, Matthias Holle and Siegmund Nimsgern, with Richard Woitach conducting.

614	TV: PREMIERE OF 'SIGNATURE,' AN A&E INTERVIEW SHOW	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D71F30F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: ''Surprise your eyes!,'' the Arts & Entertainment Cable Network's unfelicitous slogan, seems even sillier than usual when applied to tonight's premiere of ''Signature,'' a species of that notoriously unsurprising television staple, the celebrity interview. Since the show begins at 11:30 P.M., it may shut some eyes.\n''Surprise your eyes!,'' the Arts & Entertainment Cable Network's unfelicitous slogan, seems even sillier than usual when applied to tonight's premiere of ''Signature,'' a species of that notoriously unsurprising television staple, the celebrity interview. Since the show begins at 11:30 P.M., it may shut some eyes.\nTonight's guest is Jack Lemmon, who reflects in the course of his half-hour, ''We go through different plateaus in our life''; reveals his lifelong ambition ''to be the best actor I can be''; laments that Hollywood's star system keeps him from playing small parts, and recalls the declaration of his father, an executive of a large baked-goods concern, ''The day that I don't find romance in a loaf of bread I'm gonna quit.''\nWhat distinguishes ''Signature'' is less the quality of the information it conveys than the method of conveyance. The interviewer, Gregory Jackson, who is also executive producer of the series, can be glimpsed under the opening titles as a shadow. Thereafter, the camera remains on the face of the guest, often moving in for exceedingly tight shots that deprive him of the tip of his chin and his hairline. Even this innovation is unsurprising, since Mr. Jackson has been doing it for years. These shows were made in 1981 and have been seen on other channels.\nMr. Lemmon's eyes, nose, lips and sideburns are not painful to watch, and as an interviewer, the invisible Mr. Jackson is a couple of notches above the morning talk-show hosts. He patronizes but does not pander, and sometimes he actually seems to be listening to what his guest says -which is the basic problem with ''Signature.'' It confirms the long-established fact that actors without a script generally don't have all that much to say, and shows like this one compel them to keep saying it.\nComing up on subsequent Saturdays are Ed Asner, Jason Robards, Jacqueline Bisset and Mel Torme, to be followed by 110 others. Surprised?
615	THE COLLAGE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN: FRAGMENTED IMAGES OF BLACK LIFE	1987-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED71F30F930A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Romare Bearden, dressed in a Navy mechanic's jump suit and knit cap, is not a pretentious painter, despite the fact that his collage paintings, which capture in snatches of photographs and colored paper pieces of American life, are known throughout the world.\nRomare Bearden, dressed in a Navy mechanic's jump suit and knit cap, is not a pretentious painter, despite the fact that his collage paintings, which capture in snatches of photographs and colored paper pieces of American life, are known throughout the world.\nFifty-five of Mr. Bearden's semiabstract works, including his earlier Cubist compositions and his later collages, are on display at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street. The exhibition, which continues through March 1, is titled ''Origins and Progressions.'' A videotape documentary about Mr. Bearden's life, ''Bearden Plays Bearden,'' accompanies the exhibition, which is sponsored by the Founder's Society of the Detroit Institute of Arts.\n''You don't paint what you see, you paint what you feel,'' Mr. Bearden said recently in an interview at his Canal Street apartment in Lower Manhattan. He was speaking of his collage paintings in which fragmented images of conjure women, birds, railroads, factories and Harlem musicians reappear. These are the themes, he said, that make up the tapestry of black urban and rural life.\n''Trains are so much a part of Afro-American life, both in myth and in legend,'' the 74-year-old artist said, commenting on the predominance of trains in one collage, ''The Baptism'' (circa 1964). The inspiration for this particular compostion, he said, came from his years growing up in Mecklenburg County in North Carolina. ''A lot of poor black people worked on the railroads and they lived near the tracks. Trains can either take you there or take you away.'' Collage and Cubism\nMr. Bearden uses neon greens and yellows in juxtaposition with disparate textures - cloth, paint, paper, photograph - to create vivid scenes and landscapes that appear to jump from the page.\nThese are collages, and yet the artist feels he is part of the Cubist discipline. ''I feel that I am a flat painter, a Cubist painter,'' Mr. Bearden said. ''I like the tradition of flat painting that you see in China, Persia and revived again in Japan.''\nUntil Picasso's 1912 collage ''Still Life With Chair Caning,'' collage was not formally accepted as an art movement. The origins of collage date back further, to 12th-century Japan, 13th-century Persia and 17th-century Europe. Collage is now considered an assimilation of several different movements: Surrealism, Dadaism and Cubism.\nIn another collage, ''Suzannah at the Bath,'' a woman bather dresses. Mr. Bearden said, ''A lot of the Old Masters like Rembrandt did this, using the ritual of bathing as a cleansing thing.''\nMr. Bearden received his only formal training during a year at the Art Student's League. ''Afterward, I copied Rembrandt and some of the other masters for about two to three years on big sheets of brown paper,'' he said.\nMany of the collages at the Bronx Museum, such as ''Homer's Iliad,'' the 1948 colored pencil-and-ink trilogy, suggest the influence of some of the masters - Duccio, Giotto and Rembrandt. In ''One for the Trojans,'' the proportionate layering of figures, suggesting a duplicity of movement, implies Cubism. But the deep, rich blues, yellows and purples that Mr. Bearden uses to fuse these paintings suggest the improvisational freedom equated with collage. American Tradition\nMr. Bearden, who has won many awards and citations, believes his craft is one part of a greater whole, making up America's literary and artistic tradition.\n''I think of myself first as an American,'' Mr. Bearden said. ''And being an American means four things. One, being in the tradition of Emerson, Emily Dickinson, Melville, Walt Whitman. Second, you have to have the spirit of the whole Negroid tradition. The third tradition is the frontiersman, like Mark Twain and Bret Harte, and the fourth tradition is the Indian.''\nMr. Bearden does not give himself a rating in the hierarchy of art. ''I just do what I do,'' he said.

The Utah trial of Frances Schreuder, convicted of forcing her son to kill her father, brought forth not one but two best-selling books: Shana Alexander's ''Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder - A Family Album'' and Jonathan Coleman's ''At Mother's Request.\nAlmost as bizarre as the murder story itself are the various efforts to package the tale for public consumption. The Utah trial of Frances Schreuder, convicted of forcing her son to kill her father, brought forth not one but two best-selling books: Shana Alexander's ''Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder - A Family Album'' and Jonathan Coleman's ''At Mother's Request.'' Commercial television, ever eager for a bit of sensationalism, then decided to dramatize not one but both of the books.\n''Nutcracker,'' starring Lee Remick, will be presented as a six-hour mini-series on NBC later this season. ''At Mother's Request,'' starring Stephanie Powers and running for a mere four hours, is being unveiled on CBS tomorrow and Tuesday at 9 P.M.\nDirected by Michael Tuchner for the Vista Organization Ltd., ''At Mother's Request'' was adapted for television by Richard DeLong Adams, who has untangled the twisting strands of the story well enough to deliver a clear, chronological script. The scenario keeps shifting from Salt Lake City, where the 1977 murder of Franklin Bradshaw took place, to New York City's fashionable East Side, where his daughter Frances lived with her three children. Mr. Adams gets the facts right, but the ''lesson'' that's evidently intended remains obscure.\nPlayed with chilling intensity by Ms. Powers, Frances Schreuder is a woman teetering on the edge of madness. Having gone through two marriages, she is now torturing her children, bestowing and then taking away her affections as her sadistic whims dictate. The goal is total control. Larry (Corey Parker), the eldest, is often forced to sleep on the street when mama decides he has been bad. Mark (Doug McKeon) rushes to light her cigarettes and do anything that might please her. Even tiny Ashley (Jenna von Oy), a student at the School of American Ballet, can sometimes become a target of mother's completely irrational fury.\nFrances despises her mother but her almost pure hate is reserved for her father (E. G. Marshall), a multimillionaire whose tightfisted ways infuriate her. Living in near poverty, despite her New York address and her prominence as a benefactor of the New York City Ballet, Frances is determined to have her inheritance, and the plot to murder her father is hatched. It is eventually solved only because Frances antagonizes a cohort, the seedy snob Richard Behrens (John Wood), in a silly argument involving a few thousand dollars. The spurned ''Uncle Dickie'' decides to go to the police in return for his own immunity from prosecution. Frances and her son Mark are now serving time in Utah State Prison.\nIn merely trying to keep the story straight, in explaining who did what and when or where it happened, ''At Mother's Request'' tends to keep a distance from motivations and psychological explorations. We learn that Frances has always felt unloved and is determined to make everybody else feel the same way. We find out that very few poeple have ever been able to say never to Frances. We watch her mother, Berenice, being a gullible fool when it comes to dealing with her strange daughter. But none of this explains the pervasive viciousness that will eventually lead to family murder.\nPart of the story's fascination, of course, is in how it rips the veil from seemingly ''respectable'' society. This is, at bottom, a retort to the warm, loving family portraits favored by Norman Rockwell or Ronald Reagan. Here was a wealthy, hard-working Salt Lake City family, a pillar of the Mormon community. Here was a former Bryn Mawr woman, a patron of the arts in New York's supposedly sophisticated world. The surface images of success are reassuring. Just beneath is almost unrelieved horror. In refusing to draw hard conclusions, ''At Mother's Request'' ends up as a curiosity, intriguing but pointless.\nPress material for the film includes a jail interview by two network officials with Mark Schreuder, who still shows little apparent regret for shooting his grandfather in the back and then finishing him off with a bullet in the head. ''It's sort of like a classical Shakespearean tragedy,'' he ventures. Looking forward to a possible parole in 1994, Mark is working with computers and keeping up with the stock and commodities markets. His tip for the future: ''Buy platinum.'' The anecdote may be more revealing about contemporary values than the entire movie.

Commitments for improvements and construction projects total more than $40 million in an area recently plagued by store vacancies and a declining commercial and retail base.\nAFTER several years of decline, a turnaround is building momentum in the center of Illinois's second-largest city. Commitments for improvements and construction projects total more than $40 million in an area recently plagued by store vacancies and a declining commercial and retail base.\nThe biggest boost to the city's recent rejuvenation - state backing for the development of a 10-story regional state office building - was confirmed late last year by Gov. James R. Thompson. A site and a plan for the $10 million complex on the Rock River are set, with construction to begin this spring.\nAs envisioned, the 90,000-square-foot building will house a crime lab and conference center and accommodate other state offices now scattered throughout the city. Governor Thompson also plans to keep an office there as part of his promise to turn Rockford into a major center of state government along with Chicago and Springfield, the capital. A $16 million, 210-room luxury hotel and a $2 million, 400-car parking deck are also planned.\nFour blocks away, Federal and city funds are being used to raze several dilapidated buildings and convert an entire square block into a $4.6 million terminal for regional and city buses. It is expected to be completed late this year.\nWhen larger department stores like J. C. Penney moved in 1979 from the downtown area to a regional shopping center at the city's edge, a two-block pedestrian mall was put in place to draw people to the city center and combat store closings. It failed, and store vacancies soon exceeded 50 percent.\nAt the same time, Rockford was hit by layoffs from employers such as Chrysler and the Ingersoll Milling Machine Company, a tool-and-die maker. In 1982, the city's unemployment rate was 20 percent.\nBusinessmen and real-estate investors said the mall had to be removed if there was to be hope for the downtown area. ''The mall became a symbol of despair,'' said Charles L. Durham, Rockford's economic development coordinator.\nConsequently, when the mall was reopened to traffic in 1985, it was seen as a turning point, and other steps followed.\nTo attract evening visitors, the city bought a vacant local department store in 1985 and spent close to $1 million to convert it into a 250-seat theater, with offices and rehearsal areas, for the New American Theater.\nA private developer bought the vacant J. C. Penney store last year and plans to renovate it into a $4.5 million office-retail complex by mid-1987.\nCity officials admit that the downtown area cannot compete with shopping-center developments and will never again be a major retail center. Instead, service-oriented businesses are focusing on Rockford's role as a county seat and as an expanded center of government services.

Robinson's department store in downtown Los Angeles was reopened last month after extensive reconstruction, nobody missed the significance of still another sign of commercial rebirth along a six-block stretch of Seventh Street between Figueroa and Broadway, once known as the ''mecca for merchants.\nWHEN the first floor of J. W. Robinson's department store in downtown Los Angeles was reopened last month after extensive reconstruction, nobody missed the significance of still another sign of commercial rebirth along a six-block stretch of Seventh Street between Figueroa and Broadway, once known as the ''mecca for merchants.''\nIn its heyday in the 20's, it was home to some of southern California's largest and most elegant department stores, an impressive array of imposing stone and steel buildings, in a mix of Romanesque, Gothic and commercial architectural styles.\nBut by the late 60's, freeways leading to suburban malls had sucked most of the business off Seventh Street, which then fell prey to inconvenience, vagrancy and filth. By most accounts, the area hit bottom in 1972, when it looked like the retail equivalent of an elephant's burial ground.\nPlanners and brokers say a corner was turned in 1973, when the Broadway, a major local retailer, moved its downtown store into a newly built complex containing offices, shops and a Hyatt Hotel. Rising suburban land prices had made downtown property attractive again, and office towers were rising nearby.\nProjects now under way include a $25 million rehabilitation of a Hilton Hotel at one corner of Seventh and Figueroa, construction of a 22-story Home Savings office tower at a second corner and the planned expansion of the Citicorp Plaza complex of offices and retail outlets on a third corner.\nMultimillion-dollar rehabilitation projects have restored the luster to several of the street's older office buildings, according to officials at the city's Community Redevelopment Agency. Seventh Street is scheduled to be a major stop on the Metro Rail system, and in the last few years several upscale specialty shops have moved into the area.\nThe effect of all these changes is not yet clear, since much of what has been added is either brand-new or still under construction. In general, however, analysts say the jury remains out, judging from uneven leasing activity and equally uneven sales figures. Some say the recovery here may yet be sidetracked by a downtown glut in office space, or continued suburban competition.\nStill the renaissance at Robinson's - undertaken at an undisclosed cost -has a nice symbolic edge to it. Marble and granite floors, barrel-vaulted aisles and canopied glass pavilions have restored much of the store's faded sense of elegance. As a result, the store is once again among the most attractive members of its 25-member southern California chain.\n''I think it means a lot to people who have been around Los Angeles for a long time'' to see the store refurbished, said Donald Spivak, a spokesman for the Community Redevelopment Agency. ''I think it says we're starting to come back.''

Almost immediately, the immigrant opened a bagel bakery in front of his house.\nSIXTY years ago Harry Lender left Lubin, Poland, and came to West Haven. Almost immediately, the immigrant opened a bagel bakery in front of his house.\nIn 1978 his sons, heading what had turned into a multi-million dollar frozen bagel distribution business, H. Lender and Sons, opened a bagel restaurant in Orange. Two years later they opened a second one in Hamden.\nBut the Lenders are not the only bagel merchants in the region; in fact, a bagel rivalry seems to be in the works.\nThree years ago Harry Lengel, who owned a Dunkin' Donut franchise, took over a closed International House of Pancakes restaurant on one of New Haven's busiest streets and with his sons converted it into the Bagel Connection, a bakery and restaurant.\nNow the two families are taking their businesses one step further: Both want to open a chain of franchised bagel restaurants.\n''Bagels are a great growth market,'' said Fred Montgomery, president of the Lender brothers' new company, S. Kinder Restaurants Inc., which is based in Woodbridge. ''It appears younger people are getting on to bagels as a more delicious thing that's healthy and economical.''\nBagels are in great demand, Mr. Lengel added, ''because of the health craze. Look around our shop and you'll never see any grease.''\nIn 1984 Kraft bought Lender's Frozen Bagel Manufacturing Company, which had sales of about $60 million, but the family kept its two restaurants. One of the conditions of the sale, however, was that the name of the restaurants be changed, Mr. Montgomery said. The name S. Kinder is derived from the Yiddish expression meaning ''eat, children,'' he said.\nThe company will open five restaurants next year, Mr. Montgomery said; three in Fairfield and Hartford Counties, one in Manhattan and one in Westville, across the street from its competition, the Bagel Connection. The company hopes to open franchises, as well, he said.\nMeanwhile, another company-owned Bagel Connection is being built in downtown New Haven, Mr. Lengel said, adding that he was also working with about 20 people who want to start franchises. The franchises should open next year in Fairfield and Hartford Counties, New York and New Jersey, he said.\n''Competition is good,'' said Marvin Lender, vice chairman of S. Kinder. ''We've been in the middle of a bagel boom for years and years and years and there's no end in sight. The more bagel activity there is, the more bagel awareness.''\n''We're being swallowed up by a Goliath,'' Mr. Lengel said of the Lender brothers' company. ''Actually, we're not really competitive. They freeze their bagels and we would never do that in a million years.''\nMurray Lender, chairman of S. Kinder, said the company does use frozen dough, made at its plant in New Haven, but that the bagels are then boiled and baked at the restaurants.\n''Everyone else uses a plain bagel and throws stuff on top,'' he pointed out. ''We put our sesame seeds, onions and garlic throughout the bagel.''\nThe families share many similarities, including fathers named Harry, a tradition as bakers, two sons who help with the family business and the closeness of their names, Lender and Lengel. But their restaurants are in sharp contrast.\nThe Bagel Connection is designed similar to a cafeteria, with a tile floor and about a dozen tables. It offers 20 varieties of bagels at 25 cents each; its newest creation is a spinach bagel. The company's new location in downtown New Haven will be larger than its present site and will have a more contemporary design in earth tones, said Mr. Lengel's son, Gary.\nThe decor at S. Kinder, which bakes 17 varieties of bagels that sell for 30 cents each, tries to capture the feel of the neighborhood that the Lender brothers grew up in, said Joseph Tendler, director of communications for S. Kinder. The restaurants have about 40 tables.\nOld street, bakery and movie theater signs adorn the walls. There is a showcase with large jars of jelly beans, gum-ball machines and an old cash register. The S. Kinder restaurants, which have waiter service, pride themselves also on their salads and freshly squeezed orange juice.\nBoth companies indicated that their goal is to have a nationwide chain of restaurants. They said there are roughly 30 independent bagel shops in the state, but no other chains.\n''Our family has never done anything but bagels and it's important it stays that way,'' said Murray Lender.\nHis brother Marvin added, ''It's exciting to take a backyard business and turn it into a national business.''\nJo O'Neil of Hamden, who is a customer of both restaurants, said she did not think the Bagel Connection will be competition for S. Kinder because the latter restaurant is ''really well known.''\n''If you're going to the restaurant in Orange for Sunday brunch you can't get a seat,'' she said. ''Everybody and their uncle goes to Lender's.''\n''Everybody hears about them,'' Mr. Lengel said of the Lender brothers, ''and we have a better, bigger, cheaper and tastier bagel.''\nMurray Lender countered: ''I think our bagel is the best bagel in America, but on the other hand, I've never eaten a bad bagel.''

Some recipes are especially suited to revising. Here's a case in point.\nStart with chicken cutlets, the boned and skinned breast halves that are sold in supermarkets. (Or you can start with whole breasts and bone and skin your own.) The recipe that calls for stuffing them, then cooking them in sauce can be varied almost infinitely.\nA spinach stuffing seasoned with cheese and walnuts, with a red wine sauce spiked with balsamic vinegar, is one approach. Mushroom duxelles, a fine puree of mushrooms and shallots enriched with a little cream, makes a different dish, this time the sauce based on dry Marsala wine and smoothed wih some cream.Smoked mozzarella bound with rice provides yet another taste for the stuffing, its sauce made with tomatoes and white wine. Each of these recipes is cooked in about the same manner; the set of stuffing ingredients and sauce flavorings have changed.\nTry a few variations on your own. A filling of pesto and bread crumbs with a light tomato sauce might be one idea. Cooked wild rice and shallots bound with a bit of cream in a sherry-and-cream sauce is another. Finely minced ginger, scallions, garlic, Smithfield ham and water chestnuts for a filling, with a sauce of chicken stock and dry sherry, gives the dish a Chinese character, especially if the chicken rolls are dusted lightly with water chestnut flour or cornstarch instead of wheat flour.\nChicken Breasts Stuffed with Spinach 1 pound fresh spinach or a 10-ounce package of frozen. 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons finely minced shallots 1 clove garlic, minced\n1/2 teaspoon dried sage 2 tablespoons walnuts 2 tablespoons freshly grated Italian Parmesan cheese\nSalt and freshly ground pepper 8 small boned and skinned chicken breasts, about 2 1/2 ounces each, pounded thin. 4 tablespoons flour 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup dry red wine 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\n1.

624	PROPERLY CUT MOLDINGS CAN PROVIDE A DECORATIVE TOUCH	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D91438F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: WOOD moldings have so many uses, both decorative and practical, that few woodworking or carpentry projects can be satisfactorily completed without them.\nWOOD moldings have so many uses, both decorative and practical, that few woodworking or carpentry projects can be satisfactorily completed without them.\nIn most cases moldings add a finishing touch to a job - for example, to trim around the edges of a door or window frame, or to conceal gaps on inside or outside corners after wood wall paneling has been installed.\nMoldings can also be used to dress up a simple flush door by gluing strips to the surface to create a paneled effect. The same thing can be done on a flat painted wall. Or they can be used to add a decorative touch to otherwise plain surfaces or woodworking projects.\nA simple plywood box, for instance, can be ''dressed up'' to look like a skillfully hand-crafted chest or cabinet by simply adding moldings on the corners, and perhaps some moldings that form a design on the sides or top of the box. Two or even three different styles of molding can be combined to create a single, more elaborate-looking molding, or to create the effect of a heavy frame around a large poster or wall-mounted decoration of any kind.\nIn addition to these purely decorative uses, moldings also have many practical uses around the home, such as covering up joints or seams that are less than perfect and helping to make joints more waterproof, especially around the outside.\nRegardless of how molding is used, its final appearance will be determined by how neat a job the handyman does in fitting and joining the individual pieces. Neatly fitted joints that have no unsightly gaps or ragged edges will give the project a finished, professional look, while poorly fitted joints that have unsightly gaps or ragged edges will give the whole job an amateurish and sloppy appearance.\nTo insure snug-fitting joints, it is essential that moldings be accurately cut off at the proper angle, and that cuts be clean and smooth with no splintering. To accomplish this, a sharp, fine-toothed saw should be used, such as a backsaw or dovetail saw; even a hacksaw fitted with a coarse blade will work fine. Mitering is the technique most often used to join two pieces of molding that meet at right angles, especially on outside corners. Each piece is cut off at a 45-degree angle so that the two ends will form a 90-degree angle.\nFor accurate cutting, a miter box will be needed to guide the saw and to hold the molding steady while the cut is being made. An inexpensive or homemade one similar to the one illustrated here is more than adequate. There are also more elaborate models you can buy that are made of metal and will permit adjusting for all angles.\nNormally made of wood, these U-shaped miter boxes have one set of slots to guide the saw when cuts are to be made at a 90-degree angle, and another set of slots to guide the blade when cuts are to be made at a 45-degree angle. The molding to be cut is placed on the bottom of the box so that its back edge -the edge that will go against the wall or other surface - is against the back wall of the box. It should be in the same position as it will be when installed.\nA cove molding, for example, which normally fits into the corner between a wall and ceiling at about a 45-degree angle, should be held inside the box at the same angle. For the actual cutting, a backsaw - a special saw similar to the one shown here - is the best type of saw to use. It has a stiff metal spine along the top of the blade to insure a straight cut, and has its handle set at a more suitable angle for use with a miter box. An ordinary carpenter's saw can also be used, but it must be sharp and the finer the teeth the better. Even then, it will not give as clean a cut as a backsaw or a dovetail saw (a smaller version of a backsaw with finer teeth).\nOne problem with installing moldings on an outside corner - such as where two walls meet - is that the corner joint formed by the walls is not always exactly 90 degrees. One way to compensate for this is to cut the molding off at an angle that is slightly more or slightly less than 45 degrees after some trial fitting with scrap pieces, and possibly some sanding or filing to insure a perfect fit. Another way is to install the moldings as is -with mitered ends at a 45-degree angle -then fill in any gaps that remain by using a spackling compound or wood plastic.\nIn dealing with inside corners, the same problem often occurs. So a different technique, known as coping, is used by most professional carpenters. Even when the corner does form a 90-degree angle, it is often difficult and time-consuming to achieve a really accurate fit, because even the slightest gap will be noticeable when viewed from above. With a neatly coped joint there is seldom if ever a gap visible. And when you are not dealing with an accurate corner angle, coping solves the problem of determining the correct angle; when properly done, it almost insures a neat-looking corner joint.\nCoping is done by first cutting off the end of one piece at a straight 90-degree angle, then nailing this piece in place against one of the walls with its square end butted straight into the corner as shown. The end of the second piece is then cut off with a coping saw - a fine-toothed jigsaw that is designed for cutting intricate curves - so that its cut end matches the profile on the front of the molding when it is pushed against the face of the piece that is already in place, as shown here. With a simple shape like the one illustrated here, you can use a scrap piece of the molding to trace its profile onto the back of the piece to be coped. Then follow this outline, on the back, with your coping saw as you carefully trim off the end to match this profile.\nThis technique works only with moldings that have a flat backside and a fairly simple shape. The method that most carpenters prefer, and the one that will work with any molding, regardless of shape, is to first use a miter box to cut off the end of the second piece at a 45-degree angle, just as though it were being mitered.\nYou will then notice that the inside edge of this cut, the edge that is along the carved face, clearly outlines the face of the molding, so all you have to do is cut the end off a second time with the coping saw. Only this time you cut it off at a 90-degree angle while following the outline of the molding's face so as to reproduce its profile on the end of the piece. You can now push this into the corner with the curved or cut-out end directly up against the face of the previously installed piece on the other wall.\nWhen a single length of molding is not long enough for the job, so that two pieces have to be joined end to end, most handymen will simply butt the ends together. However, this creates a joint that is often quite visible, and one that will be prone to opening up periodically as the wood shrinks.\nA much neater and less noticeable joint that will not be affected by expansion and contraction of the wood can be made by using a technique known as scarfing. Each piece is cut off at a 45-degree angle, as shown here, then the two angled ends are overlapped, as illustrated, before being nailed in place. For best results the nails should be slanted toward the piece underneath so that they go off at an angle that will more deeply penetrate the second piece, rather than going straight through into the wall behind the two.\nQuestions about home repair should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. Questions of general interest will be answered in this column; unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.\nHOME CLINIC

The end of the second piece is then cut off with a coping saw - a fine-toothed jigsaw that is designed for cutting intricate curves - so that its cut end matches the profile on the front of the molding when it is pushed against the face of the piece that is already in place, as shown here. With a simple shape like the one illustrated here, you can use a scrap piece of the molding to trace its profile onto the back of the piece to be coped. Then follow this outline, on the back, with your coping saw as you carefully trim off the end to match this profile.\nThis technique works only with moldings that have a flat backside and a fairly simple shape. The method that most carpenters prefer, and the one that will work with any molding, regardless of shape, is to first use a miter box to cut off the end of the second piece at a 45-degree angle, just as though it were being mitered.\nYou will then notice that the inside edge of this cut, the edge that is along the carved face, clearly outlines the face of the molding, so all you have to do is cut the end off a second time with the coping saw. Only this time you cut it off at a 90-degree angle while following the outline of the molding's face so as to reproduce its profile on the end of the piece. You can now push this into the corner with the curved or cut-out end directly up against the face of the previously installed piece on the other wall.\nWhen a single length of molding is not long enough for the job, so that two pieces have to be joined end to end, most handymen will simply butt the ends together. However, this creates a joint that is often quite visible, and one that will be prone to opening up periodically as the wood shrinks.\nA much neater and less noticeable joint that will not be affected by expansion and contraction of the wood can be made by using a technique known as scarfing. Each piece is cut off at a 45-degree angle, as shown here, then the two angled ends are overlapped, as illustrated, before being nailed in place. For best results the nails should be slanted toward the piece underneath so that they go off at an angle that will more deeply penetrate the second piece, rather than going straight through into the wall behind the two.\nQuestions about home repair should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

627	SERGE LIFAR - AN UNFORGETTABLE STAR	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DD1538F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: When Serge Lifar was first introduced to the dancers in the Paris Opera Ballet in 1929, their attitude toward the new Russian guest star from Diaghilev's recently disbanded Ballets Russes was decidedly hostile. Within a few hours of rehearsal, however, their future director already felt at home. Looking back later upon his relationship with the company, Lifar saw himself as ''a sort of happy shepherd.\nWhen Serge Lifar was first introduced to the dancers in the Paris Opera Ballet in 1929, their attitude toward the new Russian guest star from Diaghilev's recently disbanded Ballets Russes was decidedly hostile. Within a few hours of rehearsal, however, their future director already felt at home. Looking back later upon his relationship with the company, Lifar saw himself as ''a sort of happy shepherd.''\nLifar's flock, in fact, remained unusually loyal during the nearly 30 years he reigned as head of the Paris Opera Ballet. A controversial figure whose self-advertising personality may have hindered a balanced appreciation of his achievements, Lifar has been easily scorned by British and American critics who - unlike the French - have not seen the majority of his ballets. In most cases, they did not see Lifar at his dancing peak.\nHis death in Lausanne on Dec. 15 at the age of 81 is a reminder again that Lifar's career - with all its contradictions - needs to be placed in perspective. Universally dubbed one of ballet's greatest egocentrics (even by his admirers), he has also been recognized (even by his detractors) as the major figure in the renewal of 20th-century French ballet. Yet, perhaps in the long run he will and should be remembered for the ideas and actions that were forerunners of many of the premises we now take for granted in dance. Despite the many years he lived in France, Lifar's celebrity was completely international. Serge Diaghilev made him a star, and he played the role to the hilt to the very end as dancer, choreographer and propagandist for dance's rightful place among the arts.\nBorn on April 2, 1905, in Kiev and the son of a civil servant, Lifar began studying ballet at the late age of 16. A friend took him to the private school of Bronislava Nijinska in the Ukranian capital. Nijinska rejected him, but he managed to get into the classes she taught in the state-run Central Studio of the Kiev Opera Ballet, which she then directed.\nWhen Nijinska rejoined Diaghilev's company in 1921 and sent for five of her best male pupils from Kiev, Lifar substituted himself for one who dropped out. As a dancer and, later, budding choreographer in the Ballets Russes from 1923 until Diaghilev's death in 1929, he was clearly the impresario's favorite. Diaghilev sent him to study with Enrico Cecchetti in Turin to make up for his lack of classical training. Nicholas Legat was among his teachers in the Ballets Russes.\nYet, despite his late start, Lifar had an unassailable stage presence. In a company that was totally experimental, he was perfect material. Nowhere was this more evident than in the young George Balanchine's ballets. Beginning with ''Barabau'' (1925), a comic ballet to a sung cantata in which Lifar was a police sergeant chasing an Italian peasant, the new star was cast in most of Balanchine's ballets. This historical fact was recalled by Balanchine many times in recent years whenever he was accused of not having created major roles for men during his career. The premieres of ''Apollo'' and ''The Prodigal Son,'' of course, featured Lifar in the title role.\nLifar also danced in the numbers Balanchine created for Charles B. Cochran's revue in London in 1930. A year earlier, however, Lifar had been invited to dance in the Paris Opera Ballet's version of Beethoven's ''The Creatures of Prometheus.'' Balanchine, the original choreographer, fell ill, and Lifar took over the choreography. In 1931, at the invitation of Jacques Rouche, the Opera's director, Lifar officially became ballet master and dancer. He remained as director of the Paris Opera Ballet until 1945, when charges of collaboration with the Germans - not helped by his own boasts of high connections with German authorities - caused him to leave and become director of the Nouveau Ballet de Monte Carlo. Lifar, cleared of the charges and given a year's suspension, returned as director of the Paris Opera Ballet in 1947. The condition was that he not dance on stage, given the intensity of postwar feelings.\nIn 1949, he danced again, and his last performance at the Opera was as Albrecht in ''Giselle'' in 1956. He resigned as director in 1958, although he was briefly re-engaged as choreographer in 1968.\nNo factual account can quite convey the passions Lifar engendered around him. These were rooted in his artistic ideas, not merely in his well-publicized escapades - challenges to duels with Leonide Massine and the Marquis de Cuevas, or his ballet for helicopters at the 1950 Paris air show. Nor should one focus on his penchant for creating roles for himself. In his version of ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' he was a faun without nymphs.\nThe truth is that it was his serious side that caused the deepest controversy. Essentially, he held high the banner of Neo-Classicism in ballet and campaigned to make choreography an independent art. In the age of Balanchine, this is a familiar esthetic. But it must be remembered that Lifar publicized this viewpoint in the 1930's, when it was far from accepted. In the post-Diaghilev era, choreography was still viewed as subordinate to music and scenery.\nIn retrospect, the ideas of Lifar, Nijinska and Balanchine are remarkably close. The academic idiom was a springboard for innovation. Dancing was to be the prime element in ballet. Early on, Lifar recognized Nijinska's insistence on the autonomy of ballet technique - that its formal values had their own meaning.\nLifar publicly went one step further. Dance, as an independent art, could exist without music, he proclaimed in a manifesto in 1935, as much as 15 years before modern dancers, including Merce Cunningham, came to the same conclusion. Lifar realized these ideas in ''Icare'' (1935), his most famous ballet. He choreographed the work to no music - only his internal rhythms. Arthur Honneger and J. E. Szyfer created the percussion score, based on these rhythmic counts, that was played during performances of ''Icare.''\nLifar also added what he called the sixth and seventh positions to ballet's five basic foot positions. In the sixth, the feet were parallel - Lifar often gave his ballerinas plies on toe in this position. In the seventh position, one foot was behind the other in single file. Last summer, we saw it in the archaic profile with shoulder held forward in the Paris Opera Ballet's revival of ''Les Mirages.'' Lifar also asked his ballerinas to knuckle over on toe, to achieve an off-centered look that rendered the old ballet silhouettes more dynamic.\nLifar's choreography - the execution of his ideas -did not receive universal recognition. In part this was because, unlike Balanchine and Nijinska, he insisted on dancing and choreographed often to his own capabilities. More important, he had never acquired the full lexicon of classical training they had received in St. Petersburg. Whether he had the requisite genius is another issue. Nonetheless, the seriousness of his endeavour should not be questioned. One has only to recall the decadent image of the Paris Opera Ballet when he took over. He battled with the concept of the Opera ''as a drawing room'' where people came to socialize, and he sought to make ballet more than trivial entertainment. His first order was that the house chandeliers be extinguished during performances. Male dancers were ordered to shave off mustaches, ballerinas forbidden to wear personal jewelry on stage. He ended the practice of using the infamous Foyer de la Danse as meeting ground between ballet girls and admirers. He inaugurated a full evening of ballet every Wednesday, along with ''ballet months.'' He restored star ranking to male dancers and introduced Tchaikovsky's music. He made the ballerinas dance on toe, when they often preferred half-toe. He fostered the careers of France's new ballerinas, including Yvette Chauvire. The reign of the Italian ballerinas was over. Lifar, in fact, sent many of his dancers to study with Russian emigre teachers to soften the Milanese influence in the Paris Opera School.\nAs a young dancer, he was charismatic by all accounts. His dark exotic looks and athletic body gave him an animal intensity. A child's-eye view is unreliable, but in 1949, on a trip to Paris, I saw his portly but still-dramatic presence dominate the stage in ''Icare.'' The image remains.\nIn 1985, I saw the Ballet de Nancy perform his ''Phedre,'' with its libretto and decor by Jean Cocteau. Alternately broken-lined and academic, the choreography needed better dancers, but the ballet's conception was fascinating. In addition to ''Les Mirages,'' the Paris Opera Ballet has recently revived ''Icare'' with Patrick Dupond. Lifar's major Neo-Classical ballet - different from his mostly allegorical works - is ''Suite en Blanc,'' to be performed in May by the school of the Paris Opera Ballet.\nDuring the 1979 Bournonville Festival in Copenhagen, I found myself sitting next to Lifar and then met him again in 1982 at Gilberte Cournand's Galerie de la Danse in Paris. Somewhat bitter, he expressed concern that he would be forgotten. History, however, will make a place for Lifar as a serious contributor to 20th-century ballet -one who did things his way.\nDANCE VIEW
628	'ACTIVE' LOUDSPEAKERS ARE ON THE HORIZON	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDC1538F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Crossing over into a new year always triggers the prophetic urge, but forecasting is getting harder these days. It was a lot easier when everything was thought to be predestined. In our topsy-turvy times, there are few safe bets left, but at least you can guess at the outcome of things that are well under way or just over the horizon.\nCrossing over into a new year always triggers the prophetic urge, but forecasting is getting harder these days. It was a lot easier when everything was thought to be predestined. In our topsy-turvy times, there are few safe bets left, but at least you can guess at the outcome of things that are well under way or just over the horizon.\nIn audio, the winds of change are blowing strongly from Europe. Meridian and B & W in England, Revox in Switzerland and Bang & Olufsen in Denmark have been pushing the idea of ''active'' loudspeakers. These are speakers containing their own amplifiers, thereby obviating the need for conventional amplifiers or receivers. Such self-powered speakers connect directly to a preamplifier, which has all the necessary operating controls.\nAdvocates of this approach say that it assures the best match between speaker and amplifier since each is made specifically for the other. Moreover, such speakers usually contain a separate bass amplifier to feed the woofer and a treble amplifier to feed the tweeter. That way each amplifier can be designed especially for its assigned segment of the frequency range.\nWhether such speakers will find a following among venturesome audiophiles in 1987 is still an open question, but several firms are already making a new kind of component to be used in conjunction with ''active'' speakers. This is a one-piece combination of radio tuner and preamplifier, meant to replace the conventional receiver or amplifier wherever speakers containing their own amplifiers are employed. Adcom and Revox have just put such units on the market, and ADS plans to introduce one later in the year.\nIt is also becoming obvious that nobody will be able to hold back DAT any longer. This controversial development - DAT stands for digital audio tape - in effect is the cassette counterpart of compact disks. Carrying the music in digital form, these cassettes - smaller than those now in use - sound every bit as good as CD's and have the added advantage that, like standard audio cassettes, they permit recording as well as playback. CD's, by contrast, are for playback only.\nThis dual capability prompted attempts to keep DAT off the market. Record companies feared that the virtually flawless copies that can be made with DAT would undercut their sales, and, as has been previously reported, they exerted their considerable influence to delay or kill the whole project.\nSuch pressure proved unavailing, and several British, German and American record companies suggested that DAT recorders should be legally required to have a special electronic ''lockout'' device to prevent the copying of recordings. Late in December, the Japanese manufacturers of DAT turned down this request.\nThis refusal, along with the evident readiness of the equipment, seems a sure sign that DAT is now definitely in the offing. The introduction of this top-quality digital recording medium for the home - probably by mid-year - will almost certainly prove the pre-eminent audio event of 1987.\nHowever, American record companies are urging Congress to impose a 35 percent import duty on the machines to make copying of records more expensive. DAT makers retort that copying records does not constitute piracy unless it is done for profit.\nDespite all the activity abroad, the American audio industry stands to gain the most in 1987. After dominating the audio market and other vital areas of the economy for more than a decade, the Japanese are suffering from an overdose of success. Their currency has risen so high in relation to the dollar that Japanese manufacturers have lost much of their cost advantage.\nSome American audio firms hope to make the most of this by designing basic components that look less complicated and are simpler to operate than most Japanese models. Believing that the current emphasis on highly sophisticated controls and operating features confuses rather than pleases the typical listener, American companies like NAD, Proton, Acoustic Research and ADS are therefore heading in the opposite direction: few knobs, simple operation, plain looks, but no compromise in quality.\nSOUND
629	THE ERA OF BROADWAY REVIVALS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DB1538F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The live Broadway musical may be in the process of becoming scarcer and scarcer, but such shows seem to be taking on new life as recordings. For one thing, the advent of the compact disk has seen the reissuing of many famous original-cast albums of the past. But there has been, as well, a rush to record new versions of past hits in digital sound and often with opera stars in roles created by musical comedy performers.\nThe live Broadway musical may be in the process of becoming scarcer and scarcer, but such shows seem to be taking on new life as recordings. For one thing, the advent of the compact disk has seen the reissuing of many famous original-cast albums of the past. But there has been, as well, a rush to record new versions of past hits in digital sound and often with opera stars in roles created by musical comedy performers.\nThe current plans of a number of major companies make clear that this is not a one-company, one-producer phenomenon. It is also evident that it is the classical departments of the companies that are drawing up the plans, as ''crossover'' recordings by classical stars become more attractive economically.\nAt CBS, the booming sales of its new recording of ''South Pacific'' with Kiri Te Kanawa and Jose Carreras have not gone unnoticed. It has sold over 300,000 copies in Britain and more than 250,000 in the United States, where it has been No. 1 on the Billboard crossover chart. ''We are dedicating ourselves to recording shows,'' said Joseph F. Dash, senior vice president and general manager of CBS Masterworks, the classical division of the record company.\nMr. Dash disclosed that CBS and the Rodgers and Hammerstein office would be collaborating on a new recording of ''Carousel'' under the musical direction of Michael Tilson Thomas, with a cast still to be announced. According to Mr. Dash, studio sessions are planned for June. Ted Chapin, managing director of Rodgers and Hammerstein, acknowledged that ''we and CBS have had a lot of conversations.'' He said the technical sound quality of the 1945 original-cast recording, with John Raitt, made a new version, in updated sound, desirable.\nMichael Tilson Thomas also figures in plans by CBS Masterworks to record two Gershwin shows that will be part of the forthcoming Gershwin Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music - ''Of Thee I Sing'' and ''Let 'em Eat Cake.'' Neither CBS nor BAM would talk about cast, but Mr. Dash said it would be ''star-studded.'' He said it had not been decided yet whether to record the shows live or in the studio. ''Of Thee I Sing,'' originally staged in 1931, was the first musical to win a Pulitzer Prize. There was no original-cast recording, but a revival with Jack Carson and Paul Hartman did produce an album on Capitol.\nThe one man who in recent years has been most identified with the phenomenon of show albums has been Thomas Shepard, now head of MCA Classics, whose RCA Red Seal recording of Stephen Sondheim's ''Follies'' a couple of years ago was widely acclaimed. Mr. Shepard is not resting, however: his first project for MCA, the original American cast recording of the Broadway hit ''Me and My Girl,'' has just been released, Mr. Shepard also is planning to record two previously unrecorded Sondheim shows - ''The Frogs'' and ''Evening Primrose'' - hopefully with Mandy Patinkin in the latter. ''The Frogs'' was originally produced by the Yale Repertory Theater in 1974. ''Evening Primrose'' was written for television in 1967. Mr. Shepard, who has been closely identified with Sondheim recordings, also said he had recently been to San Diego to see a production of a new Sondheim work, ''Into the Woods,'' but that no recording plans had been discussed yet.\n''Carousel'' also figures in Mr. Shepard's plans. He said he was working on the possibility of a new recording of the show, but would not be more specific as to casting than to say he was ''hoping'' to get Barbara Cook, Marilyn Horne, Sarah Brightman and Mr. Patinkin.\nThe new attraction of musical shows for classical labels extends beyond the shores of America, as well. Deutsche Grammophon, of course, had a huge success with Leonard Bernstein conducting his own ''West Side Story'' with an operatic cast, and now London Records is planning a new recording of ''My Fair Lady,'' with Kiri Te Kanawa of the opera stage and Jeremy Irons of screen and stage as Eliza Doolittle and Professor Henry Higgins, respectively, the roles created by Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison. John Mauceri will conduct.\nAnd another label, EMI/Angel, says it ''wants to do'' a new recording of ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' but that no cast had been lined up yet. The original cast recording, of course, starred Alfred Drake and Patricia Morison.\nAside from the obvious goal of turning an honest dollar, what else is prompting the rush to put old musicals on records these days? Irv Lichtman, deputy editor of Billboard and a close student of American musicals on records, suggested that record companies undoubtedly wanted to expand the audiences for classical artists. He also said he beleived the companies felt there was a strong market for old musicals with new casts and updated, digital sound. Karajan Operas\nDespite the spate of reissues on compact disks, there have been and will continue to be many glaring omissions. One group of omissions -many opera recordings conducted by Herbert von Karajan - is about to see the light on CD. London Records, having resolved contractual problems, has announced the release of eight of them over the next two years, beginning in February with the 1961 ''Otello'' with the Vienna Philharmonic and a cast headed by Renata Tebaldi and Mario del Monaco in a two-CD set.\nLater in 1987, London will issue the 1972 ''La Boheme'' with Mirella Freni and Luciano Pavarotti, with the Berlin Philharmonic. Also coming up in 1987 are ''Madama Butterfly,'' also with Freni and Pavarotti, and ''Die Fledermaus,'' with Regina Resnik, Eberhard Wachter and Hilde Gueden.\nIn 1988, London's Karajan opera release schedule will include ''Tosca'' with Leontyne Price and Giuseppe di Stefano; ''The Marriage of Figaro'' with Jose van Dam; ''Boris Godunov'' with Nicolai Ghiaurov, and ''Aida'' with Renata Tebaldi and Carlo Bergonzi. And Davis Operas\nReissues of another famous series of operas has also been started by Philips - the Berlioz cycle conducted by Sir Colin Davis. Just out on compact disk are two works. The first is ''La Damnation de Faust,'' on two disks, with Nicolai Gedda as Faust and Jules Bastin as Mephistopheles. Josephine Veasey is the Marguerite. The other release, on four disks, is ''Les Troyens,'' with Jon Vickers and Miss Veasey.
630	CBS ORDERS UP A MORNING SHOW, LIGHTON THE NEWS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDB1538F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The producer of ''The Morning Program,'' the new broadcast that will replace the ''CBS Morning News'' next week, was interviewing a well-known New York journalist for the job of co-host on the program. ''Are you a news purist?'' the producer asked. ''No,'' replied the journalist, ''I'm not.'' It was just the right answer; he got the job.\nThe producer of ''The Morning Program,'' the new broadcast that will replace the ''CBS Morning News'' next week, was interviewing a well-known New York journalist for the job of co-host on the program. ''Are you a news purist?'' the producer asked. ''No,'' replied the journalist, ''I'm not.'' It was just the right answer; he got the job.\nIt might seem a strange litmus test for CBS to be applying to journalists, but news purism is the last thing that CBS wants on ''The Morning Program.'' The new show means to rise from the rubble of the old ''CBS Morning News,'' a broadcast that was forever flailing in a tangle of contradiction and confused purpose - To be news, or not to be news? - until at last it was killed this summer. When CBS executives decided to cancel ''The Morning News,'' their rationale was that even though the program had tried to be soft and amusing like NBC's ''Today'' and ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' sleepy morning viewers assumed that anything coming from CBS News was hard-ball journalism and switched channels. The CBS News image, the network brass concluded, smudged the ''Morning News'' like a taint and doomed it to failure.\nSo, they turned the time period out of the news division and hired Bob Shanks, an entertainment producer, to make something different, something that would work, something that most of all would not be news. This week, the show that Mr. Shanks has invented for CBS is going through its final run-throughs, and, although its chances are uncertain, one objective is guaranteed: It will never be mistaken for news.\n''The Morning Program'' will feature, among other things, a Hollywood gossip segment, a video dating service, a comic co-host, a comic weatherman, a comic announcer and, if things work out, a comic writer-performer with a specialty in rude noises. There will also be a dog.\nThe search for success in the morning at CBS has been so frustrating that William S. Paley, the founder of CBS, has himself taken a direct hand in leading the new program to the starting gate. And now, after 30 years of disappointment with news efforts, the network patriarch says, ''I think we're going to have a hell of a strong show in the morning.'' After a pause, he adds, ''But you've got to keep your fingers crossed. You never know.''\nMr. Shanks's fingers, it is safe to guess, are firmly crossed. His task is to develop a program that not only succeeds in the ratings but must survive in the highly charged environment of CBS. CBS News is a proud and, at the moment, pained institution; it was badly shaken by the decision to take 90 minutes of its two-hour morning time block away for the sake of an entertainment show. Not all at CBS News are cheering for the success of the celebrity-heavy, gimmick-driven comedy package that has come to rest in the place where news used to reside, and Mr. Shanks knows it.\nLast week, for example, word went around the building that Don Hewitt, the executive producer of ''60 Minutes,'' suggested to Laurence A. Tisch, the CBS chief executive officer, that the moribund ''CBS Morning News'' was in the best shape it had ever been in and that he reconsider the decision to kill it. ''We do have natural enemies in the building,'' said Mr. Shanks, ''there's no question.''\nBefriending the news division may come, but first, there is the matter of solving the mystery of morning television. Beginning a week from tomorrow, CBS will be breaking up the traditional two-hour morning time block, with a half-hour of hard news at 7 A.M., followed by the new ''Morning Program'' from 7:30 to 9. Mr. Shanks, an experienced producer, has been there before, having developed the then-revolutionary ''Good Morning America'' program for ABC. This time around, Mr. Shanks, who was hired by CBS in September, decided early on to create a sort of radio comedy show with pictures. The format that will be revealed to viewers next week features the actress Mariette Hartley as the wacky center of the program, with the sober countenance of Rolland Smith, the former anchorman at the CBS flagship station, WCBS/Channel 2 in New York City, at her side. Mr. Smith will be there ''to play off of,'' as Miss Hartley put it. Bob Saget, a comedian of the urban comedy-club tilt, will be the announcer and general-purpose sidekick, and Mark McEwen, a veteran of morning radio comedy, will be the weatherman. Their show will take place on an elaborate set designed as a combination country kitchen/ family room, complete with a working fireplace.\nIn the early stages, Mr. Shanks was so guarded about the format that he conducted a secret run-through at CBS headquarters at Black Rock; for an audience, he corralled a group of CBS executives, who were asked to vow silence on what they saw.\nBut now the show has been pronounced ready; if there is a theme to it, it might be the phrase that Miss Hartley employed when introducing the program to CBS affiliates in a closed-circuit broadcast two weeks ago: ''We think there's more to life than news.'' The format certainly attests to that belief.\nThe show will start each day with a weather report, followed by a viewers' poll. Viewers will be invited to cast their votes on such subjects as the national highway speed limit and sex education classes, with a daily ''resolution'' to each issue coming at the end of the broadcast (which presents something of a problem to viewers in western time zones, who, watching a taped version of the show, will not be able to participate).\nThere will be personal finance segments, a segment called ''Living Better'' that will deal with relationships, and a segment called ''Sensible Shopper,'' slotted at the end of each show on the premise that by then, most viewers will be women who are staying at home. There will be a heavy emphasis on comedy (underscored by the fact that David Steinberg, the comedian, was hired to direct the show's on-air promotions) centered in a regular feature called ''The Comedy Club,'' featuring brief portions of stand-up comedy acts. Also, Mr. Saget will make little comedy films, a la the ''Mr. Mike'' segments from the old ''Saturday Night Live'' show. (In a sample shown to affiliates, Mr. Saget screens a tape of his own wedding, with a running commentary: ''It was a Jewish wedding. There was a $2 cover charge.'') The show will be a haven for celebrities, with a gossip columnist, a daily star interview (Frank Sinatra is said to be already booked) and a segment called ''Teachers,'' which will have celebrities appearing with teachers who made a difference in their lives.\nNews will not be completely unwelcome, with five-minute local and network news blocks inserted on the quarter hour, and a running segment of news features reported, as Mr. Smith put it to the affiliates, ''from a different and more human perspective than any other morning program.''\nOne such story, he said, would explore the human side of AIDS. ''We'll introduce you to a bright, attractive young woman who's suffering from AIDS. And we won't just see her once. We'll be following her over a period of time so that you'll get to know her and share with her the toll that AIDS is taking on her and her family.''\nAnd then, there is the ''Personals'' segment. In the sample segment shown to affiliates, a young man named Jim appears on screen and proclaims, ''I'm looking for an energetic, outgoing and fun-loving woman with whom I can share candlelight dinners, drives along the coast and wild nights on the town . . . .'' Mate-hunters will communicate by mail, through a special post-office box.\nThe feature raises questions that CBS never had to consider when it was in the news business in the morning. At a recent news conference to announce the format, a reporter asked Mr. Shanks, ''Say you do some matching up of people and let's say some kook has responded to that and somebody is murdered or hurt. Who is responsible?'' Mr. Shanks assured the reporter that CBS has ''done everything we prudently can do to prevent that.''\nThe ''Morning Program'' might have become something quite different had CBS landed the host it sought first, the actor Alan Alda. Mr. Alda was contacted by the network to host the show and declined. ''He's a movie star and feels that he has play left in that career, which I agree with,'' said Thomas F. Leahy, executive vice president of the CBS Television Network, who is the corporate executive in charge of the new show. ''He wasn't interested in getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning.''\nBut Mr. Shanks had worked with Miss Hartley on a TV movie and on a pilot for a children's show and was convinced that she could carry his new program. ''I saw in that program that she could interview, that she could react to the moment and that she could be funny and warm,'' Mr. Shanks says.\nThat settled, there began the search for Ms. Hartley's sidekick, her straight man. As it happened, Mr. Smith was, as he puts it, ''busy acclimatizing myself to the wonderful sense of freedom and exploring opportunities.'' He was out of work, having been released this fall by Channel 2 in a salary dispute after 16 years with the station.\nThere was some surprise at CBS over the choice of Mr. Smith, who in his long career as an anchorman had never shown any particular talent for comedy. But Mr. Shanks was steadfast. ''He's deeper and he goes wider than anybody around here thinks,'' Mr. Shanks says. ''You can't have two comedians, two people like her. It doesn't work in a marriage, it doesn't work in television.''\nMr. Smith has been cast in the role of the super-straight Dad, and will be the butt of the rest of the cast's jokes. ''He knows thathe's aware of it,'' Miss Hartley says. One hope, according to a cast member, is that ''little old ladies in the Midwest'' will cheer for the underdog Mr. Smith. One CBS News executive, who has been let in on the plan, offered this analogy:\n''He's the successful Westchester doctor, she's the wacky wife that everybody loves. They'll go to parties, she'll push somebody in the pool, and he'll just kind of chuckle.''\nMr. Smith is unworried about his new role. ''I'm not going to do anything that will hurt my reputation as a journalist,'' he says. ''If somebody chooses to poke fun, to have fun with that because I choose to be straight, that's O.K.''\nThe format will certainly distinguish the program from a newscast, and there'll be another difference: ''The Morning Program'' will be performed before a live audience, which presents something of a difficulty. It will be broadcast from a studio on West 57th street, a block away from the grubby West Side piers - ''not a lot of foot traffic in that area at 7:30 in the morning,'' Mr. Shanks allows. ''Our first week may be a series of shows on the homeless.''\nThe audience will participate in the show, to the degree that each seat in the studio is equipped with ''Yes'' and ''No'' buttons, allowing the audience to voice instant approval or rejection. The notion has suggested to staff members a number of comic possibilities, including sending a camera crew to the dressing quarters of, say, a Minneapolis attorney. The audience might vote ''Yes'' as the attorney dons his blue pin-striped trousers, but proclaim ''No'' as he tries to slip into a pair of argyle socks.\nStill to be convinced of the effectiveness of all this are the CBS affiliates, who have long been pressuring the network to become competitive in the morning. One station, WAGA in Atlanta, dropped the ''Morning News'' last summer and has not yet agreed to carry the new program. ''We can't carry it on the basis of what they've shown us,'' said Paul Raymon, general manager of the station. ''We think they're on to something, but we're going to just have to wait and see.'' Mr. Shanks will also soon discover the joys of competing with Steve Friedman, the producer of NBC's ''Today'' show, whose lust for a fight promises to make the new program's early going interesting. Mr. Friedman saw the detailed preview of ''The Morning Program'' shown to CBS affiliates, and offers his assessment in a series of one-liners: ''It's 'The Mourning Show.' Is it true that the theme song is going to be 'Taps'?''\n''This program,'' he adds, ''has not one chance in hell of working.'' Mr. Friedman's premise is that, in supposing that viewers are not interested in news, the CBS program insults the morning audience. ''They're very cynical. What they're saying is, 'O.K., folks, for all you women who are not smart, we'll numb your mind and give you some jokes.''\nMr. Shanks, a quiet man with a gentlemanly reputation, seems up for the fray. He noted a recent, fairly typical ''Today'' show featuring a piece on Cybill Shepherd and said he would advise Mr. Friedman, ''Physician, heal thyself. Is Cybill Shepherd news? It's looking like 'Entertainment Today,' frequently.''\nFor all of its detractors, the new program has one very staunch, and significant, supporter - William S. Paley, the network founder who returned to active duty as chairman in a boardroom coup last fall. ''The Morning Program'' has provided an avenue for programming involvement for Mr. Paley, who is now 85. When Mr. Shanks and some of his staff needed to go to California to survey the comedy scene there, they flew west with Mr. Paley in his private jet. He has been so close an observer that he has offered criticism of Miss Hartley's makeup job.\n''There had always been too much confusion about what we did and didn't do'' on the ''Morning News'' program, Mr. Paley said in an interview. Of the new program he said, ''It's entertaining, effective and it will appeal to women. It has great, great promise, and we really need something like that now.''\nAnd if there is caution toward the new show at CBS News, there is also a buzz of excitement, the sense that, after all the failures, there may be a show in the works that viewers will watch. One newsman, whose assessment of the show is not especially flattering, also notes that there is a mood of adventure to the enterprise, which has an uplifting effect on a place rocked by layoffs and other distresses. ''In an institution with no people in it anymore, it's very unusual to have that other feeling in the same building.''\nAnd in a way, Mr. Shanks believes that he can capitalize on all the grief experienced by the ''Morning News,'' the headline-drawing parade of anchors, formats and producers that attended that failed enterprise.\n''Ironically, the pains of this summer may have worked to my advantage,'' he says. If nothing else, he adds, ''we'll get enormous audience sampling from people waiting to see another auto accident.''
631	THE EAST BLOC TOLERATES JAZZ BUT MUTES ITS DISSIDENT NOTE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DA1538F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Throughout the East Bloc, jazz is no longer decadent or even suspect. In fact, everywhere, with the exception of Czechoslovakia - where paradoxically jazz has had the longest and most developed traditions - the music has been divorced from politics.\nThroughout the East Bloc, jazz is no longer decadent or even suspect. In fact, everywhere, with the exception of Czechoslovakia - where paradoxically jazz has had the longest and most developed traditions - the music has been divorced from politics.\nBut if this means that jazz is now widely and openly heard in Eastern Europe, even embraced by certain Communist governments, it also means that to a large extent it has been wrenched from a social context, from the demimonde of protest and the dynamics of cultural opposition. Once-forbidden fruit has been distilled and diluted, and in the process, its wine has lost some of its bite.\nObviously, something similar has taken place in the West. Music that was first formed in bordellos and speakeasies has found acceptance and honor in high places, and along the way Dionysian impulses have, to some extent, been replaced by formalism. At the same time, in the West, new styles - rock, reggae, punk, New Wave -spawned in subterranean warrens have shot through and drawn wider audiences as successive generations tried to get their own licks in, defying whatever establishment they thought weighed them down.\nBut in the Communist states of Europe, where culture has been, and still largely continues to be, a concern of monopolistic state power, such transformations are not organic. Rather, they tend to be abrupt and bureaucratic. Ruling elites, under pressure from worldly elements, often including their own children, are persuaded to deem the impermissible permissible, and even at times desirable. And so it was with jazz, but as the music shifted from clandestine cellars to the concert halls of the palaces of science and culture, the undertones changed.\n''There is no doubt that jazz is now more than acceptable, it's fashionable,'' said Tomasz Tluszkiewicz, who as Continued on page 00 the elected head of Poland's Jazz Society arranges concerts, produces records, and books Polish and foreign jazz performers. ''But I would be lying if I said I did not miss the old days when jazz had a more provocative meaning.'' Mr. Tluszzkiewicz, who is 42 years old, gave up his job as a professor of engineering to work full-time in jazz.\n''For me,'' he says, ''in my youth, jazz offered escape and stretched my imagination. It was tied to yearnings of oppressed blacks, to spontaneity, even to images of abandon and sexuality, and I think that was the way it was for most of my contemporaries. It still reflects some of these elements, but today it is more likely that the attraction is for jazz as music rather than for a comprehensive metaphor of a free life.''\nFor older generations both the music and the metaphor were terribly significant. Ernest Bryl, a Polish poet, recalls that 30 years ago students he knew risked expulsion from university for possessing jazz albums. A popular film made here three years ago called ''There Used to Be Jazz'' documented that period in the 50's when musicians played in basement rooms, putting up mattresses against the doors to muffle the sound and keep passers-by from denouncing them.\nAlso at that time, Leopold Tyrmand, one of Poland's earliest and most outspoken dissident writers, who died last year in Florida, wrote passionately about jazz as the quintessential embodiment of spontaneous expression and the idea of freedom. But when after the Stalinist 50's the music began to gain official sanction, he lost interest in it as a literary subject.\nJosef Skvorecky, the emigre Czech novelist now living in Toronto, has focused on jazz in Czechoslovakia and his own involvement with the saxophone as a recurring motif in which the music, banned first by the Nazis and then by the Communists, nurtures flickering flames of faith in freedom, joy and redemption, for himself as a young man and, even now, for the Czech and Slovak nations.\nNow everywhere in the East Bloc except in Mr. Skvorecky's homeland, the battle against jeans and jazz has been conceded. Today, there are officially sponsored jazz festivals in all the East Bloc countries and in the Soviet Union. The annual Warsaw Jazz Festival is probably the single most popular cultural event in Poland, rivaling major Chopin recitals and dwarfing festivals of Russian popular songs and army choirs. Jazz, from swing to bebop to fusion, is played on state radio. There is a division of jazz at the state music conservatory in Katowice, and in Poland alone there are nearly 300 musicians who make their living exclusively playing jazz. An international publication, Jazz Forum, is produced in Warsaw - printed in English - and receives a Government subsidy.\nJazz clubs exist throughout the bloc, even in small towns, and probably the most recognizable American voice in all East Europe is that of Willis Conover, the slow-speaking host of the Voice of America jazz programs.\nA few weeks ago, in a neighborhood jazz club in Budapest, the Hungarian jazz pianist Gyorgy Szabados reflected the more formalistic trends of much of today's jazz as he explained to a visitor what he sought to address and engage with his music. In an adjoining hall some 200 young people, dressed for the most part like 50's college students, sat listening to long, dissonant pieces for horns, drums and guitars that were played by Mr. Szabados's colleagues.\nThe 48-year-old pianist, who was trained and still works as a surgeon, said that jazz had been his passion since childhood and that he dreams of the day he can leave behind the practice of medicine and earn his living entirely by playing his long compositions, with their floating and fluctuating rhythmic patterns. For 45 minutes Mr. Szabados talked of his influences: Bartok, Bach, Transylvanian folklore, Far Eastern philosophies, Indian and Japanese music, and yes, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Sun Ra and the clarinetest Anthony Braxton, with whom he has made a record called Szabraxtondos.\nAt no point was there even a hint of ''us-against-them'' sensibilities. No intimation of the hip against the square, the forces of spontaneous improvisation against the Communist virtues of planning and predictability. Instead, Mr. Szabados revealed the eclectic relativism of many of today's Eastern jazz musicians. He respected Mahler, atonality, the Beatles and Jewish klezmer music.\nAt times he talked of combining all these influences and elements into music that he said would advance ''universal values of inner peace and harmony,'' but which he hoped to synthesize musically as Hungarian jazz. Some of his fans, sitting in the adjoining hall, claim he has succeeded. ''When I listen to Szabodos, I can see Transylvania,'' said one young painter. Transylvania is Hungary's shame and obsession, the lost land and its sizable Hungarian-speaking population living under Rumanian rule.\nMr. Szabados's music would be considered avant-garde even in TriBeCa, but it is not regarded as a challenge by the Hungarian cultural authorities. For them it is a matter of personal choice whether people prefer Szabados's jazz or Bartok or chamber music or gypsy music or rock-and-roll or Muzak.\nThis is not so in Czechoslovakia, where the major social conflict is over cultural freedom and the key battle is being fought over jazz. There is official, state-approved jazz, and there is illicit, illegal jazz identified with a group of jazz lovers known as the Jazz Section. Buttons with Jazz Section insignia and Jazz Section graffiti are regarded by authorities with the same suspicion that attaches to Solidarity insignia in Poland. In Czechoslovakia, there are rules governing the performance of even sanctioned jazz. No performers can appear in jeans, presumably because this would cause semiotic overload in an audience, doubling up Western symbols.\nFor at least five years the Government has sought to circumscribe, curb and destroy the Jazz Section with its 5,000 dues-paying members and larger legion of sympathizers. Ruled nonexistent, the Jazz Section proclaimed itself through meetings, publications and art shows. The group's publications were the most widely read sources of uncensored material not only about jazz but about modern literature, movies, theater and modern art. The Government explained its attempts to close down the Jazz Section by saying the group had concerned itself with cultural matters that had nothing to do with jazz.\nKarel Srp, the 52-year-old elected president of the Jazz Section, never hid the fact that he regarded jazz as much more than music, and he defended the group's right to extend all cultural freedom. Shortly before his arrest last fall, he told this reporter that jazz in its broadest sense connoted improvisation, spontaneity and the universality of culture, and that to be understood jazz had to be explored within contemporary reality, which means all the ideas, thoughts and beliefs of our time. He particularly incurred the anger of the authorities by traveling to an international meeting in Budapest to seek support for greater free expression in Czechoslovakia within the framework of the Helsinki agreement.\nEven before that Mr. Srp lost his editor's job because of his Jazz Section activities. He said he did not care and began working as a lathe operator. The group's lawyer had the tires of his car slashed. The association was denied the right to stage concerts, to have a phone, to use the mails. Still it persevered.\nThen, last September, Mr. Srp and six fellow elected officials were arrested. They are still in jail under investigation for alleged involvement in illegal financial transactions, and a show trial is likely to be held this month. The defendants can face as much as four years in prison.\nMeanwhile, a new temporary leadership of the Jazz Section has been formed and with the support of Charta 77, the major Czechoslovak intellectual human-rights organization, these people are eager to publicize the case, hoping to bring international pressure to bear on Czechoslovakia to release Mr. Srp and his associates and to leave the Jazz Section free to foster not just music, but criticism, discussion, debate and ideas.\nPart of the Czechoslovak defense against oppression has always been sly whimsy, and a Good Soldier Schweik approach to life's problems is evident in Prague's beer halls and wine bars. It is a style that is suited to deadpan put-on, irony and canniness, all of which shape the music of a popular, totally nonpolitical jazz band called the Original Prague Syncopated Orchestra. Its 14 members, all in their 20's and 30's, play white and black jazz of the 1920's, songs originally performed by groups such as Clarence Williams's Blue Five, Fletcher Henderson's Orchestra and Joe Manone's Harmony Kings.\nThe singer uses a megaphone like Rudy Vallee and the musicians wear Harold Lloyd spectacles and part their hair in the middle. So do their fans.\nWhy the 1920's, four of them were asked after a concert. ''It was the best time,'' said all four in deadpan harmony. ''It was the best time.''

He means the $20 million Paramount film saga of Treasury agent Eliot Ness's Prohibition-era war against Al Capone that is to be released in June. Brian DePalma has just finished shooting it in and around the rococo niches and coves of Chicago that foam like the mob's best beer with the memories and mood of the 1920's.\nFather Mulloy, a young priest during that mythical decade, had, against the wishes of his archbishop, acted as a quasi-peacemaker go-between with the city's gangs, said prayers over many a slain mobster's flower-choked grave and finally been exiled for several years to South America, allegedly for knowing too much. When the television series (unrelated except by name to the David Mamet script of the new movie) made its debut in 1959, Father Mulloy watched carefully. ''They're all there,'' he reportedly mumbled as Capone, Frank Nitti and others trooped across the screen of his black-and-white set. ''But they've got it all wrong.''\nFather Mulloy, himself long years dead, might have a different opinion standing in the time warp of Union Station during the week of long nights as Mr. DePalma directs a spectacular shootout between Treasury agents and Capone's men on the worn marble staircase now glistening under braces of blinding lights. A giant blue-trimmed banner cascades down a far wall, announcing a torchlight parade and rally at which the union leader John L. Lewis will speak. Extras in period dress mill about the pew-like waiting benches and the re-created green-trimmed offices and shops.\n''I'm from Waterloo, Iowa,'' a slim blonde in a cloche hat confides to a visitor. ''I don't have any lines, you know, but I'm hoping.'' Sailors look up from a cluster of crisp duffel bags toward Mr. DePalma, patient as a chemist over his powders, setting up a shot with a camera mounted on a Chapman crane to follow a baby carriage tumbling down the slippery treads. ''Ever see 'Potemkin'?'' someone asks a young studio aide. '' 'Potemkin'?'' she responds in a puzzled tone.\n''The word is, De Niro's here,'' a security guard whispers, as if announcing the arrival of Capone himself 60 years before. Mr. De Niro is in fact playing Capone in this film, which also boasts Sean Connery as an aging Chicago policeman and Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness. ''See up there?'' the guard asks, gesturing to the top of the staircase where the window of a mock Army recruiting office was shot out the night before. ''They left all the broken glass and fake blood there. Scared hell out of the commuters this morning.''\nMr. De Niro is here, Capone is here and with them the numinous magic of America's fascination with movie stars and gangsters. ''Bobby's been trying to gain weight,'' one assistant says to another, ''and they don't want anybody to see him.'' ''Yeah,'' an associate counters, ''I hear he went to Italy, ate a lot of pasta, but he only gained 20 pounds.''\nMr. De Niro has arrived in Chicago after completing a run in a Broadway play, is registered as Mr. R. Benson at the Ritz Carlton, has been studying Movietone newsreels of Alphonse Capone, has requested silk underwear from the same New York Sulka shop from which Big Al bought his. ''They brought him in the back in a limousine,'' the assistant says hoarsely, as Mr. DePalma calls for quiet on the set. ''He's upstairs trying on pads and scars.''\nThe shuffling and coughing halt in the great space of the concourse. The period baby carriage is trundled up the steps by the stunt coordinator, Gary Hymes. At the top he places his 16-month-old son, Colin, inside it. ''The kid stops crying the minute he puts him in,'' another aide confides. ''I hear he's taking gymnastics and swimming lessons already.''\nThe safari-jacketed Mr. DePalma peers down impassively as the carriage and the camera roll. Just out of camera range, Mr. Hymes, with two other stunt men descending warily behind him, bumps the perambulator backward under the tracking camera all the way down the steps. ''That was very nice,'' Mr. DePalma says softly, signaling for a retake.\nThe visitor edges around the crowd toward the far staircase. A broadly smiling white-haired man sits on a director's chair next to a pair of padlocked wooden chests. ''I'm the gun man,'' Branco Wohlfahrt says cheerfully in a thick accent. ''I come only when they need a fully automatic weapon.'' He nudges the chests with his foot. ''I'm from L. S. Mercantile. We do 90 percent the movies, 'The A Team,' too.'' He points toward several Tommy guns displayed on a table. ''Rubber. Go ahead, feel them. When we were in Montana for the Canadian scenes, they used them on horseback, but they have to be careful not to bend the barrels. Doesn't look right.'' Mr. Wohlfahrt kicks the chests. ''These are real guns in here. You know, it's harder to shoot blanks than real bullets. No place for the explosive force to go. I'm the first one who fixed the Luger to shoot right in the movies.'' The visitor heads again for the stairway.\nArt Linson, the amiable, stubbly bearded producer, leans protectively against the wall at the base of the stairs, holding a dead cigar in one hand. ''I asked David Mamet - we were at dinner in the Village after he won his Pulitzer Prize - if he'd like to write a new version of 'The Untouchables.' Right away, he said, 'I'm in.' '' Someone calls a question to Mr. Linson and he excuses himself.\nA few feet away stands Eric Schwab, the dark-haired 28-year-old U.C.L.A. film school graduate (''Can you believe it?'' he asks good-naturedly) who selected the Chicago locations. ''We wanted to enter this particular period without any back-lot cheating, get the real look of 20's Chicago,'' Mr. Schwab explains, adding, ''Brian gave me free rein.'' The visitor nods, moves toward the ornate doors of the elevator that are just opening and punches two.\nThe unmistakable aura of work recently completed fills the murky, cable-strewn second-story hallway. A burly man wearing a windbreaker on which Paramount's snow-clad mountain logo rises above the words ''The Untouchables'' throws a glance worthy of a Capone bodyguard. The adjoining elevator doors are just closing as majestically as a stage curtain on a star. De Niro/Capone is slipping away as the visitor descends quickly to the lower level. At the far end of the grimy cab tunnel a large car is heading up the ramp into the night.\nA few days later in a chill, cavernous warehouse on the West Side of Chicago, dozens of extras fill a ''holding area'' near the full-size two-tone green courtroom built for Capone's climactic trial for tax evasion. Mr. DePalma stands in the well of the court, radiating a zone of rarefied calmness, almost peacefulness, that envelops the cohorts of technicians, assistants and gofers who crowd the closed set. No press, no photographers; Mr. De Niro insists on a closed set.\n''I have to concentrate intensely,'' Mr. DePalma says later of his disciplined tranquillity. ''I have to see what is going to show in the picture. This is a business in which you can photograph your mistakes. And I feel everything that's going on around me - how the actors are, even whether the camerman had a bad night. I can't allow any of those distractions to affect the work. Directing resembles conducting a symphony orchestra, because you must respect the score, hear the brasses and the strings, even appreciate what the players are feeling, and bring all these elements together.''\nThe director, whose graying hair and beard give him the look of a pensive Risorgimento statesman, is the keeper of Mr. De Niro's concentration as well as his own. ''Bobby is very humble and will wait a half hour before complaining,'' he says. ''But I can see a sudden movement of distraction in his eyes when people who shouldn't be there get into his sight lines. That's when I have to clear the set.''\nMr. De Niro, head down, bustles into the courtroom as assistant directors position the extras who serve as courtroom spectators and reporters. The visitor cranes his neck, but De Niro/Capone hunches over the defense table, turning his face quickly away. He is ex-athlete stocky in a close-fitting gray pin-stripe suit, and his hairline has been raised (''Two inches,'' whispers Mr. Linson appreciatively). The slightly thinned hair is flat and shiny as seal skin. But he is immediately obscured by a middle-aged, worried-looking lady with a comb and scissors who is making last-minute adjustments. Next to her a tall, craggy man bends down to examine Mr. De Niro's makeup as gravely as a plastic surgeon.\n''Bobby's own people,'' an aide explains. ''Both from Italy. And Richard Bruno from New York designs all his clothes. He's the first one he thanked when he won the Oscar. An 85-year-old tailor in Little Italy makes the costumes for all his pictures.''\nMr. DePalma calls for quiet, and the actor playing the prosecutor walks toward the witness box. Mr. De Niro, even though not in the scene, seems a presence, elusive and magnetic, reacting in character as scenes are repeated over and over. He shoots his gold-linked shirt cuffs, whispers behind his hand to his attorney, switches position to show only his right profile, just as Capone did to conceal the famous scars on his left cheek. Father Mulloy always said that it was hard to get a good look at Capone because grateful Chicagoans were always giving him standing ovations for providing bootleg beer in Prohibition's dry years. ''And,'' another old-timer remembers, ''he kept reporters happy with booze and dames, and only killed other gangsters, mostly.''\nAt a subsequent luncheon, the production designer Patrizia Von Brandenstein, who also worked on ''Amadeus'' and ''Ragtime,'' radiates an artist's sensibility as she describes her approach to the film's mythic setting.\n''Brian said not to concern myself with what really happened, but to be true to the time,'' Ms. Von Brandenstein says. ''It isn't just what's 'real' but what the collective 'we' think is real. Our view of the Prohibition era in Chicago is of a great legend, somewhat like that of the West created by John Ford. I have a primary response to a set of visual circumstances. Green, other than black and white, is the color of this movie. It is the color of greed, the color of Chicago in the 20's. Capone was a Neapolitan, and I chose colors for his apartment from the Commedia - robin's egg blue, ochre and malachite green - full-blown, everything acidic and the moldings a Roman gold, giving a wonderfully lurid effect. The Police Department is valued in black and white, and the other domestic colors are all tertiary. It is as if the color were all leached out by the evil sucking the life out of the city. The bad guys are in vivid colors. Frank Nitti is dressed all in white. He is the angel of death.''\nA few yards from the courtroom, the elaborate set of Capone's apartment is marble, gilt and blood red, thick with operatic ornament, and at its center stands a throne-like barber chair. The visitor savors its flamboyant decadence and returns to the courtroom set. Mr. De Niro is no longer at the defense table, but the day's newspaper carries a rumor that he has installed a barber chair in his hotel suite and that he is visited regularly by a manicurist and shoeshine man. Every morning the barber from the nearby Drake shaves him and swathes him in the kind of steaming towels that Capone once enjoyed. ''Eighty percent of these rumors,'' a production aide says, ''are untrue.''\nRumors about Mr. De Niro continue to be reported. He wears a cap all the time to conceal his freshly plucked scalp; he and Sean Penn have been spotted in local jazz clubs; he's getting to like the barber chair in his suite and never goes out; Capone lived quietly, too. A man searching for the past could stroll up State Street to Holy Name Cathedral and seek out the bullet scars in its granite facade from a shoot-out there in the 30's. Or glance directly across at the parking lot where Dion O'Bannion's florist shop once stood and where he fell under a fusillade of bullets among the horseshoe-shaped funeral sprays. Capone is still out there somewhere . . . .\nBack in the West Side warehouse, Capone's trial is coming to an end. Under Mr. DePalma's benign gaze the temper of the courtroom has grown taut as the familiar story is retold. The gangster's ledgers have been deciphered, and his rigged jury has been supplanted by another. The defense attorney changes Capone's plea to guilty and the courtroom erupts around the scowling De Niro, who is beginning to seethe under the press of events. Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness, moving out of the court, leans over the simmering defendant, whispers something in his ear.\nMr. De Niro reacts explosively, the carefully assimilated quirks and rages of Capone, everything from Movietone clips to the feel of silk underwear and the imperial barber chair that went into the carefully constructed character, kept under menacing control until now, breaks through in a startling pyrotechnic display. He lunges, hurling threats at Ness, and the bodyguards reach across the railing to restrain him. The full psychopathic force of the gangster, stripped of superficial charm, rivets the attention of everyone on the set. A wild malevolence has been set loose, the real Al Capone is here. ''Cut,'' Mr. DePalma finally calls, breaking the tension, calling Mr. De Niro back out of character. Everybody takes a deep breath. Father Pat Mulloy might well have smiled approvingly.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics should not be surprised that the pay-increase figures for Long Island's clerical and electronic data-processing workers in 1986 were the lowest in 11 years.\nThe fact of the matter is that the majority of clerical and electronic data-processing workers are women, who have traditionally been at the bottom of the wage scale. The fact of the matter is that Long Island is not experiencing a shortage in the labor pool of available clerical and electronic data-processing workers.\nWhat Long Island is experiencing is the unwillingness of this female pool of labor to work at low wages, with small salary increases and low expectations of career advancement. Arthur Ringelheim of Laventhol & Horwath, C.P.A.'s, is correct when he said, ''You cannot get good people to stay with you unless you pay good salaries - they will just jump elsewhere, especially in data processing.''

And when all eyes had turned away from the Governor and toward him, he announced, ''I came to find out what you politicians are doing about my high taxes.''\nThe room erupted in laughter and applause -the final moment in the Albany spotlight for the 50-year-old Mr. Fink, who retired last week after 19 years in the Legislature, 8 of them as Speaker, to devote himself full-time to practicing law. It was a telling moment, capturing not only his wit but also his quiet rivalry with the Governor.\nMr. Fink, a Brooklyn Democrat, tends to talk in signals, and the signals of the moment seemed clear - that this was his last day of glory and he did not like Mr. Cuomo's stealing the show, that the transit aid was a legislative as well as a gubernatorial achievement.\nIn an interview with Jeffrey Schmalz, chief of the Albany bureau of The Times, the Speaker reflected on his tenure in Albany. On the power of the Legislature:>\nThe thing I think has happened over the last couple of years - and it may have nothing to do with me, time will tell - this Assembly has become a more independent body. And by independent, I don't mean obstructionist. I mean it has become a body which is capable of initiating and promulgating, rather than just reacting to the executive branch of government, which had been the case in New York State for a number of years. That's important for those of us who believe the more checks and balances one has in government, the greater the possibility to prevent tyranny and for that government to prevail.\nWe were able to work with another branch of the Legislature which was controlled by another party and together, both houses, we made our voices heard. And I think that's new in New York State. Whether that becomes a legacy, I don't know. But that's what pleases me the most when I think about the last 8 or 10 years. On the size of the Assembly staff, which Mr. Fink used to generate reports and recommendations independent of the Governor's:>\nI think we gained power in the Assembly leadership because of our substantive knowledge of the issues of the day, and much of that knowledge came from our staffs and our commissions. I'm convinced that power in government, more than anything else, is knowledge, knowledge of the issues and knowledge of solutions. We gained knowledge of substantive issues and we were exhaustive. And that knowledge brought power. On former Gov. Hugh L. Carey, with whom Mr. Fink had frequent public disputes:>\nI think we had a clash of leadership styles. A lot of it had to do with relations between his staff and my staff. I had, and have, a great respect for his intellect. He's still one of the smartest people I ever met in government. rrxhOn Governor Cuomo:>\nGovernor Cuomo's management style is such that we have not had to flex muscle the last few years. Governor Cuomo respects the power of the Legislature and doesn't try to trample on it, so, with one or two exceptions, you never had any need for confrontation. I think everyone understands the Legislature has taken back some power and respects it. Remember that as lieutenant governor, Mario Cuomo witnessed the acrimony between the legislative and executive branches under Governor Carey. rrxhOn the quality of government:>\nI think the quality and caliber of people coming into government has gone up over the years. There are different problems confronting government now than there were 20 years ago -the problems become more complex as people's rightful expectations grow. Twenty years ago, people were debating whether health service was a privilege or a right, and now we know it's a right. So now, the questions are: How do you figure out what to deliver and how to deliver it? People's expectations grow and government's responsibility is to meet those expectations. rrxhOn criticism of Mr. Fink for working, while still Speaker, at a law firm that does business with the state:>\nIt bothers me that I got myself into a position where I was set up, where I set myself up, for what I think were articles that were unfair. I think maybe once I came to the point where I realized for personal reasons, personal financial things, I should have made a decision then either not to practice law or not to stay in government. I'm not too sure what I would do if I had it to do again. I know I've conducted myself in an honorable way, but I'm not too sure I would do the same thing again because of the appearance. rrxhOn what needs to be done:\nI wish we had put together a better housing program over the last few years. I think one is beginning to emerge now. The one thing that most concerns me is that when we go to sleep each night, there are more and more people who slip below the poverty line and go to bed each night hungry. Are we doing enough to reverse that trend? Is it us? Is it the Federal Government? Does it matter whose fault it is? It's a fact, the gap between the haves and the have-nots is growing. It's alarming. It's going to have to be addressed.

Presented by Francis Coppola. Music by Carmine Coppola. Tinted and toned. 1927. MCA Home Video. 3 hours, 55 minutes (two casettes). $79.95. The magnificence of Abel Gance's silent-film classic remains indestructible. It survives even when reduced to the comparatively paltry dimensions of this video version, a print-down of the film as reconstituted by Kevin Brownlow and presented in 1981 by Francis Coppola with a new score by Carmine Coppola.\nSeen on the small screen, ''Napoleon'' is certainly not what it is when seen in a movie palace like Radio City Music Hall, but neither is it a sacrilege.\nThe visual details are occasionally so tiny as to be virtually indecipherable, yet the power of Gance's epic vision is such that it has the effect of expanding the possibilities of the conventional television set. This is true even though Gance's technical innovations require that the images in the video version, in order to reproduce the film's grand, three-screen finale, become smaller at the very point that the theatrical film reaches its Cinerama-like conclusion. To accommodate Gance's triptych, the three panels are presented as a broad band across the center of the television screen, with approximately a quarter of the screen left blank at top and bottom.\n''Napoleon'' is no ordinary historical film. It's a pledge of allegiance to the tricolor, as well as a mystical, revisionist paean that uses virtually the entire vocabulary of the cinema - intense closeups, long shots, cross-cutting between simultaneous actions, dissolves, superimpositions and a single screen that's sometimes split into as many as six or eight different images. Gance sees Napoleon as ''the father of the revolution'' in a series of scenes and tableaux of a grandeur that still take the breath away. Highlights: Napoleon's flight from Corsica cross-cut with the Paris convention's attack on the revolution's moderates, the siege of Toulon, the Victim's Ball, and the Italian campaign that ends the film.\nNote, too, Gance's use of tinted film stock (blue, green, rose, yellow, etc.), which has absolutely nothing in common with ''colorization.''

637	Families Fail Along with Their Farms	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD81538F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: WINTER is a stark time in the nation's countryside. The fields, so full of green life and golden promise last summer, are dark and empty now, and resting. The winds are here. The nights are long.\nWINTER is a stark time in the nation's countryside. The fields, so full of green life and golden promise last summer, are dark and empty now, and resting. The winds are here. The nights are long.\nThe farming cycle is continuing as it has for generations, and farmers are paying annual bills as they traditionally do during the year-end holidays. But in the fifth year of the worst agricultural depression in a half-century, farmers and townspeople alike are feeling the fraying of bonds and assumptions and values that long sustained them.\nThe Middle West has historically been the nation's balance wheel, producing the food, the workers, the inventions, the exports and half of the Presidents since the Civil War, including two of the last three. The ideal of the close-knit, hard-working family achieving independence and social standing has its roots in the agrarian reality of the 1800s.\nThe family is still the foundation of American farming. Ninety-seven percent of all farms are operated by individuals, couples or partnerships that typically involve close relatives. Corporations - most of them family-held - run just 3 percent of farms.\nBut the number of farms fell 9 percent from 1975 to 1985, and the number of farms with less than $20,000 in yearly sales fell by over 60 percent. Thirty percent of farms are owned by people over 65 years of age, and only 6 percent by people under 35, indicating a flight of the farmers of the future.\nProfessors and politicians have argued and bargained and compromised for decades over the needs of agriculture. The Government has assembled an array of esoteric and costly Federal programs, And yet, along the back roads of the Middle West, many farmhouses stand empty and dark; small towns are freckled with boarded-up stores. These are mute evidence of the forced migration of many families to a new way of life in the cities, leaving the land to be rented, often by their former neighbors, from corporate mortgage-holders. Rural organizers who are working for new programs to protect family farms contend that such absentee owners cannot have the family's sense of stewardship of the land.\nThe human cost of the economic restructuring is high. Farm crisis hotlines are busy with calls from frightened people asking for legal advice on how to keep the land that, in many cases, has been in their family for generations. Reluctantly, many families are also looking for help in coping with alcohol or drug addiction, physical abuse or suicide threats. Last spring the rural suicide rate in Minnesota equaled the urban rate for the first time.\nOccasionally, too, individuals strike out violently against others. In December 1985, a financially troubled farmer here in Lone Tree walked into the local bank to cash a check. The teller knew the man. Not so long ago, that would have been enough security. But small-town banks have been troubled, too, in these difficult times, and threatened livelihoods breed caution. The check was not approved. Within an hour that farmer, once an affluent pillar of the community, had killed his wife, the bank president and a neighbor. He committed suicide in the cab of his pickup truck.\nApart from the violence that makes headlines in the cities, the evidence of social decay is quietly mounting. ''We're swamped,'' said Peter Zevenbergen, who runs a mental health clinic near here. Overworked professionals now concentrate on training cadres of ''peer listeners,'' men and women who volunteer to combat the isolation of despair by listening to neighbors' troubles and fears. Sondra Schweneker, one such volunteer, got involved when she noticed that her rural Illinois neighbors no longer waved to each other on the road.\nJoan Blundall, a counselor in northwest Iowa, tells countless stories of social and financial stress: the young family that lives on $9,000 a year and works 16 hours a day, and is fighting to keep even that hard life; the families who stop attending church in financial embarrassment; the men who played on the same high school football team but now never speak; the teenager who refuses to answer the telephone. He fears, she says, that the caller will want his father and that he will find the man a suicide out in the barn.\nShe says she has found a common theme in the nightmares of many youngsters there: the image of huge, noisy trucks coming to haul away not only the family's goods but also the parents.\nNO END IN SIGHT FOR ANNUAL HARVESTS OF DEBT

If it matters to us, the supposition goes, then it must matter to you. And in 1986, the events from baseball in a Queens stadium to hardball in a Connecticut courtroom justified the municipal ego.\nEVEN IN ITS DULLEST YEAR - and that is a deceptive adjective indeed when speaking of New York - this city presumes its centrality to the nation and the world. If it matters to us, the supposition goes, then it must matter to you. And in 1986, the events from baseball in a Queens stadium to hardball in a Connecticut courtroom justified the municipal ego. Which is hardly to say that all of them were welcome.\nOne clearly was: The Liberty Weekend celebration. With tall ships and fireworks, with Elvis impersonators by the hundred and foam-rubber diadems by the thousand, the city threw the 100th anniversary party for Miss Liberty. As revelry, Liberty Weekend was outstanding, but it was something more; it attested to New York as a living city of immigrants, of Haitian cabbies and Greek cooks and Indian news dealers. New York in 1986 counted more than 2.3 million foreign-born residents, approaching the high registered in 1930.\nLess than four months after Liberty Weekend, the city had another cause to rejoice, as the Mets captured their first World Championship since 1969, defeating the Boston Red Sox in a spellbinding seven-game World Series. A record 2.2 million fans swarmed to a victory parade in lower Manhattan, and, this being the computer age, rained not ticker tape but printouts down on their heroes.\nNew York needed the uplift and diversion of the Mets, for their championship season coincided with the city's worst political scandal in years. Until early 1986, the Koch administration had built a reputation on being, if the city's most abrasive mayoralty in recent history, then also its most honest. All that began to crumble Jan. 10, when Donald R. Manes, the Queens Borough President, was found slumped at the wheel of his official car, dazed and bleeding from slash wounds to his wrist and ankle in what he later admitted was a suicide attempt. It seemed sadly appropriate in this age of image that as the scandal began to break open, Mayor Koch was on a talk show with Joan Rivers, promoting his new book.\nThe Mayor survived the revelations guilty of nothing worse than oversight or ignorance, but around him collected resignations, convictions and a suicide. Mr. Manes fatally plunged a kitchen knife into his chest in early March, three days after his friend and political ally Geoffrey G. Lindenauer had pleaded guilty to racketeering and mail fraud charges dating to his term as deputy director of the parking agency in 1979. Mr. Lindenauer in turn emerged as the star witness in the fall trial of Stanley M. Friedman, the Bronx Democratic leader, unfolding a story of six-figure bribes from vendors seeking business with the bureau. After eight weeks of testimony, a jury in New Haven found Mr. Friedman and three other defendants guilty of a variety of corruption charges.\nIt made for a busy season for United States Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who commuted between the Friedman case in New Haven and the Manhattan prosecution of eight Mafia leaders. A jury found all of the defendants guilty of operating a ''commission'' that ruled the Mafia throughout the United States. Beyond its broad drama, the trial offered what was perhaps 1986's highlight in stating the obvious: defense lawyers for the mob leaders acknowledged that an entity called the Mafia exists.\nIn late December, a mob of a different sort in Howard Beach, Queens, beat three black men, chased one into the path of a car that fatally struck him - and brought New York to a moment of reckoning on its race relations. Even as three white teen-agers were charged with second degree murder in the attack, there was an act of retaliation by blacks. A gang in Jamaica, Queens, set upon a white waiting for a bus, punching and kicking him as some assailants chanted, ''Howard Beach, Howard Beach.''

It began with the horrifying explosion of the Challenger space shuttle and ended with the Presidency mired in the kind of problem that Ronald Reagan hoped the country had left behind in the Nixon and Carter years.\nTHE EARLY REAGAN YEARS constituted an epoch of confidence regained in the United States, but 1986 had more of a feeling of uncertainty. It began with the horrifying explosion of the Challenger space shuttle and ended with the Presidency mired in the kind of problem that Ronald Reagan hoped the country had left behind in the Nixon and Carter years. In between, there was more than the usual amount of change and challenge as the beginning of the end of the Reagan era hove into view.\nWhen the Challenger disintegrated in an awful fireball over Florida in January, disintegrated on live television, it administered a shock to the national psyche that went far beyond grief over the loss of seven young lives and sympathy for the bereaved. This, after all, was something that we were good at, something that we were destined to be good at. The President promised that ''nothing ends here,'' an investigative commission recommended changes that are now taking effect and there will be more shuttle flights. But most Americans will never be as sure as they used to be that all will more or less automatically go well.\nThen, too, in a year when the nation (perhaps a bit vaingloriously) celebrated the Statue of Liberty and all that it symbolized for generations of immigrants, Washington finally faced up to the fact that something had to be done about the new waves of immigrants who come not legally to help people an empty continent but illegally in search of a shred of economic hope. A new law prohibits the employment of illegal aliens and offers legal status to many illegal aliens already here, but it provides no long-term answer to the question: what do you do about the accident of geography that has given one of the richest countries on earth a border thousands of mile long with one that is very poor?\nMany of the Mexicans who sneak into the United States end up working in agriculture, and the farm culture of the United States was also under heavy pressure in 1986. With exports falling and the seemingly inconsistent 1985 farm bill causing problems, a pall of despair fell across the farm belt. Foreclosures in such states as Iowa and Minnesota helped revive the dormant debate on the future of the family farm and also to give the Democrats victory in the race for control of the Senate. Two of the key races, those in the Dakotas, produced victories for young Democratic critics of farm policy.\nThe election in November, probably Mr. Reagan's last as an active particpant, showed that he has in six years redefined the terms of political debate in this country, but it also showed that his special electoral magic is untransferrable. He stumped in 22 states, but he lost control of the Senate because he could not hold enough of the voters who backed him in 1984. On the other hand, Republican gubernatorial victories in such big, growing states as Florida and California gave the party some imposing building blocks for 1988.\nBy then, the Reagan era in the White House will be almost over, but Mr. Reagan's influence will still be felt elsewhere in Washington, perhaps most keenly at the Supreme Court. The retirement of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger gave the President the chance to place his ideological imprint ever more deeply on the Court, and he did so by advancing William H. Rehnquist to Chief Justice and naming Antonin Scalia to succeed him. Since Mr. Burger is also a conservative, the changes represented no seismic change in the court's balance, but Mr. Scalia's, especially, is expected to prove a highly influential voice.\nQuite apart from politics, the old year saw unsettling developments in the social arena - the sharp rise in the number of cases of AIDS, with no sign of a cure yet on the horizon; the explosive increase in the use of crack, a cocaine derivative, and the deeply felt conflict between many American Roman Catholics and the Vatican. In each case, uncertainty caused fear, or at least apprehension, that undercut to an undefinable degree the general mood of national self-confidence.

The danger and the hope of modern times seemed concentrated in this span of a year.\nIn a contradictory spirit of conciliation and suspicion, the nuclear superpowers restored some peripheral elements of detente but failed to find enough common ground to conclude a treaty limiting or cutting strategic arms. Their competition around the world magnified regional conflicts, fueling ethnic, religious and national strife in parts of Africa, Asia and Central America. Iran, revealed as the clandestine recipient of arms from the Reagan Administration, continued its grinding war with Iraq in one of the world's strategically crucial regions, the oil-rich Persian Gulf. Each side in that war received support from both the Soviet Union and the United States: Soviet arms to Iraq, East European and North Korean arms to Iran; American arms to Iran, American intelligence information to Iraq.\nIsrael and Jordan groped inconclusively toward accommodation, falling short of an agreement to negotiate formally on the future of the West Bank but managing an unstated policy of coordination in overseeing the occupied territory. Terrorism, the angry weapon of the weak, found targets in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere, provoking the United States into air strikes on Libya, which Washington accused of aiding the attackers. The war in Nicaragua, conducted by rebels with American weapons -supposedly purchased partly with profits from the Iran sales - bled the Central American country without changing its pro-Soviet political orientation. Guerrillas in Afghanistan, also with some American arms, continued to resist the Soviet war against their mountainous nation, despite incremental moves in the diplomatic sphere toward a possible settlement.\nThe most serious nuclear accident in history occured at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl power plant, spreading radioactive fallout across wide stretches of Eastern and Western Europe. Simultaneously, Mexico City residents began to rebuild from a devastating earthquake that struck them late in the previous year. While racism remained the ruler in an increasingly turbulent South Africa and Gen. Augusto Pinochet kept his grip on Chile, authoritarian leaders were ousted in Haiti and the Philippines, bringing the first, fresh scent of democracy to Haiti and reinforcing the democratic impulses of the Philippine people. Political opposition revived in South Korea, and students demonstrated for democracy in China.\nFor the United States, confident in its democratic ideology, the forces of history appeared to be running more favorably than a decade ago, in the immediate shadow of the Vietnam war. To the Soviet Union, preoccupied with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's attempts to reform the domestic economy, the world may have looked more adverse, particularly with the quagmire of Afghanistan and the elusive nature of arms control, Moscow's premier foreign policy goal. The gains made at Mr. Reagan's meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, with Mr. Gorbachev were not enough.\nThe high politics played against the background of constant individual suffering, of starvation in parts of Africa and deep poverty in most of the world, corrosive hardships to which the rich and powerful nations of the globe devoted little attention and practically no significant resources. And ultimately, the kaleidoscope of the year's events was reflected in individual human faces - of despairing, emaciated children and of rejoicing political prisoners newly freed. These included Andrei D. Sakharov, Anatoly B. Shcharansky and Yuri F. Orlov, three of the Soviet Union's prominent dissidents. And two other men stood juxtaposed: Kurt Waldheim, the former Secretary General of the United Nations who was elected President of Austria even after his wartime membership in Nazi organizations was exposed, and Eli Wiesel, the eloquent Holocaust survivor who won the Nobel Peace Prize. ''Sometimes we must interfere,'' Mr. Wiesel said. ''Wherever men or women are persecuted because of their race, religion or political views, that place must - at that moment - become the center of the universe.''

In this era of DNA, RNA, electron microscopes and genetic engineering, there is something extremely quaint about the kind of scientists who were called microbe hunters. As depicted in this adaptation (by Sidney Howard) of the Sinclair Lewis novel, they are people who puff cigarettes around culture incubators, brew serums in their kitchens, refer to germs as ''bugs'' and treat both bubonic plague virus and their wives with fatal condescension.\nStill, the current of idealism that pervades this story of Dr. Martin Arrowsmith and of the conflict between pure science and humanity, and between altruistic inquiry and the prospect of fame and money, proves bracing in this more cynical age. Both science and performance styles have changed greatly since this movie was made, and the videocassette provides a valuable medium for pondering the differences.\nHOME VIDEO

Gee, but her legs look great. She's in such good shape that even her feet look trim. No question about it, those workouts pay off. And incidentally, isn't she just a little too fit for Alex Sternbergen, a.k.a. Viveca Van Loren, the run-down, alcoholic actress she's supposed to be playing?\nYes, definitely. So the audience's attention will be drawn to the artifice through which this fine performance of Miss Fonda's is achieved. Her hair is bleached a weak, frowzy shade of blonde, and she often appears in glaring light that ages her greatly; in the early scene that shows her waking up from a night she can't even remember, she pantomimes a hangover so monumental that the daylight actually hurts. A makeup wizard has given her runny, bloodshot eyes, and Miss Fonda herself supplies the harsh voice, the proclivity for little lies and the messy, unstable temperament that the role requires. Still, she's somewhat out of place. She was even out of place in ''On Golden Pond'' playing Henry Fonda's prickly daughter - and she was Henry Fonda's prickly daughter, after all.\nThat Miss Fonda appears to be playing against type here is no detriment to ''The Morning After.'' As a matter of fact, it's part of the fun. It's a reminder that actors need not be wholly credible to be effective, and that a performance need not be stylized or abstract to make good use of a certain inherent falseness. Playing against type, as Miss Fonda did in ''Klute'' and again does here, can be a risky business: it can mean Sylvester Stallone playing a country singer (as he did in ''Rhinestone'') or Bill Murray as a mystic (''The Razor's Edge'') or Mary Tyler Moore as a sheltered, stay-at-home young wife (''Just Between Friends''). But this kind of chancy casting, when done well, has unexpected advantages.\nIt becomes a way of including the audience in the fiction being constructed, of inviting viewers to share and enjoy the deception to which they are privy. Used cleverly, this kind of unlikely casting becomes a confidence that the audience and the film makers can share. ''The Morning After'' has a shrewd, smart-talking screenplay (''She's got a record - assault with a deadly weapon. Did you know that when you married her?'' ''It's why I married her''). It also has an attractively light touch, but what really holds the interest is the playful sparring that links Miss Fonda with Jeff Bridges, who plays a redneck ex-policeman very much her junior. The gamesmanship extends well beyond the two actors and their roles here, since in addition to fooling one another they are also fooling us.\nEvery film star brings the memory of other roles to each new one, but those echoes needn't always be powerful. They are, though, for Mr. Bridges, who - as in ''Against All Odds'' and ''Eight Million Ways To Die'' - is once again playing the hard-boiled but implacable suitor in a story of intrigue. That he manages to bring such a different physical style to each role is part of the enjoyment of watching him; the awareness of those earlier performances actually heightens this one instead of undermining it.\nIt's especially true with Miss Fonda that the memory of earlier roles, particularly the more prim ones, adds an extra dimension to the more dissolute woman she plays here. If in ''Klute'' Miss Fonda took a more defiant posture, almost daring the audience to accept her as a prostitute, in ''The Morning After'' she takes a more relaxed, playful approach. If you're willing to believe that Jane Fonda would live on cigarettes and Thunderbird, the film seems to say, well, let's see what else you can be talked into.\nBlythe Danner isn't any less at home as an old-fashioned Jewish mother than Jane Fonda is as a dissipated ex-starlet, but it's almost an even match. In ''Brighton Beach Memoirs,'' which is one of the few Neil Simon works to adopt an explicitly ethnic tone, Miss Danner is certainly an unexpected presence. She brings not the least bit of built-in ethnic style to a role that could so easily be played as a caricature. As the kind of high-strung, hard-working, proudly ascetic parent whose nagging is her most visible means of showing affection, she seems to be newly inventing what could have been a stock character.\nThere's a little dialect, which is not the most successful part of the performance, and there are a few standard mannerisms. But most of the character is less automatic, growing out of Mr. Simon's dialogue and Miss Danner's forthright, unfettered interpretation. The mother, her overworked husband and her widowed sister are all played by actors of no distinct ethnicity. Miss Danner, Judith Ivey and Bob Dishy have been neutrally cast, and by some lights even miscast. But for that very reason, they allow Mr. Simon's memories of a Depression-era Jewish household to stand on their own. By contrast, Jonathan Silverman fits like a glove into the role of the story's wisecracking young protagonist. This feels more like typecasting, and more like overkill.\nIn Oliver Stone's ''Platoon,'' a key bit of casting against type provides the film with one of its boldest strokes. The film's young protagonist, Chris Taylor, finds himself torn between two rival sergeants, the vicious, amoral Barnes and the saintlyElias, two friends whose sharply contrasting codes of ethics eventually bring them into conflict. The players Mr. Stone has chosen for the roles are Willem Dafoe, a fine actor whose handsome face is so menacing that he has inevitably been cast (in Walter Hill's ''Streets of Fire'' and William Friedkin's ''To Live and Die in L.A.'') as the scariest of villains; and Tom Berenger, a nice-guy type. The hitch is that Mr. Dafoe plays the saint and Mr. Berenger, made up with disfiguring facial scars, plays the unprincipled killer.\nThe eventual confrontation between these two would have been shocking anyhow, but it is made all the more so by this casting coup. Both of these usually-typecast actors emerge from ''Platoon'' with whole new careers in store, and both perform brilliantly in their surprising roles. Even better, the entire fighting unit of ''Platoon'' is made up of actors cast against the familiar war-film conventions, which contributes greatly to the uniqueness of ''Platoon'' within that genre. By contrast, the Marine unit in Clint Eastwood's ''Heartbreak Ridge'' is exactly what might be expected, the usual band of misfits and miscreants who are whipped into shape by a sergeant (Mr. Eastwood) who's determined to make men out of them. The big guy is big, but he turns out to be no match for the sergeant. The small, feisty, rebellious type (Mario Van Peebles) turns out to be the best raw material in the bunch. Et cetera. Finally, there's Richard Gere, an actor who seems to bring a certain built-in attitude with him to whatever roles he plays. This isn't star quality, exactly, but it's a self-conscious aloofness that makes his King David peculiarly like his American Gigolo. In ''No Mercy,'' however, Mr. Gere appears to be approaching his role as a Chicago policeman somewhat differently. It's a tough-guy part, but the tough guy wears his heart on his sleeve, particularly after he falls in love with the beautiful blonde (Kim Basinger) to whom he has been handcuffed, a blonde who is the moll of a Louisiana gangster.\nMr. Gere seems to approach this character more openly and emotionally than he does most, to be playing against his own self-proclaimed type. And the results are refreshing and unexpected. In production notes for the film, Mr. Gere cites the late John Garfield as an influence, and that admiration is apparent on the screen, in the less studied, more spontaneous and distinctly un-Gerelike poignancy that he brings to this seemingly hard-boiled role. Incidentally, the film's director, Richard Pearce, has also cast the gangster's role a bit unexpectedly and done it with perfect elan. The part is played by the Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbe, normally a much more sophisticated type who makes a very stylish figure here. Yes, the gangster does disembowel his victims, after all. But Mr. Krabbe sees to it that he stands elegantly straight, wears a formidable-looking outfit and coolly addresses those he is about to knife as ''my friend.'' So the nastiest of roles is cast unpredictably, and played with unanticipated flair.\nFILM VIEW

His arias were masterpieces of a dying but still influential style (just as his later fugal writing out-Bached Bach). Mozart wrote the great role of Idamante for castrato soprano. In this handsome Glyndebourne production, it is taken by Jerry Hadley, a tenor who struggles uncomfortably with its high tessitura. Philip Langridge is imposing yet unaffected in the title role, but he too has his struggles with Mozart's ornateness. Yvonne Kenny is the sweet-voiced Ilia, with Carol Vaness as Electra.\nHOME VIDEO
644	THE FACES THAT HAUNT VAN GOGH'S LANDSCAPES	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D71538F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In the paintings ignited by the brush of Vincent van Gogh during the last 15 months of his life, rational and irrational are welded together. The more artistic control van Gogh gained, the more control he seems to have relinquished. The fiercer and more masterly his grip became, the more he appears to have to placed himself in the hands of something else.\nIn the paintings ignited by the brush of Vincent van Gogh during the last 15 months of his life, rational and irrational are welded together. The more artistic control van Gogh gained, the more control he seems to have relinquished. The fiercer and more masterly his grip became, the more he appears to have to placed himself in the hands of something else. In the radical work he produced during his year-long asylum in Saint-Remy in the south of France, van Gogh was at the same time master and slave, shepherd and flock, sower and soil.\n''Van Gogh in Saint-Remy and Auvers,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through March 22, focuses on van Gogh's capacity for reason. Still reacting against the myth of van Gogh the mad artist, Ronald Pickvance, the art historian and curator of the exhibition, draws attention to the artist's cultivation, his fidelity to nature and the lucidity with which he painted and saw. At Saint-Remy, and then, to a lesser degree, in the northern French village of Auvers, where he spent the last three months of his life, van Gogh's powers of discernment and organization are unmistakeable.\nBut reason alone does not explain why this show is both exhilarating and terrifying. Of the issues that suggest the problem in distinguishing between the rational and irrational in van Gogh's work, none has more urgency than the one of ''secondary imagery.'' The phrase refers to images that are rarely noticed at first glance, that refuse to get lost once they are found, and whose meaning, importance, or role is hard to define. Van Gogh's landscapes are inhabited. What faces and heads are doing in his trees and clouds, whether they were intended - and indeed whether they are even there - are questions that can mobilize impressive rational and irrational resources. What cannot be denied after this show is that these faces and heads exist.\nThere are different kinds of secondary images in this show. Some are so distinct that it may not be appropriate to describe them as secondary. Of these the best known may be the maternal or fetal cloud shape floating across the ''Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background.'' The ghostly, carnival, cloud head at the upper right of ''A Corner of the Asylum Garden'' - which seems almost to have been shot out of the amputated tree in the foreground like a circus performer from a cannon - is clear. So is the cloud face that seems to be in the process of swallowing the sky at the far right of ''Cypresses,'' like the mouth of Hades gorging itself in Durer's ''Four Horseman of the Apocalypse.''\nThere are also full figures. In a 1985 article in the magazine ''Pantheon,'' the art historian Yvonne Korshak argues for the existence of a trumpeter and other Last Judgment images in the clouds and fields of ''Crows Over the Wheatfield.'' To the right of the ''Mountains at Saint-Remy,'' nestled in the hillside like a ''Slave'' of Michelangelo asleep within his stone - but also protective of the proud little army of trees and flowers marching alongside the road - there appears to be a reclining figure. If it brings to mind reclining nudes, it also suggests a painter with palette.\nThe most expressive and revealing of the secondary images may be the heads and faces in trees. Van Gogh's identification with trees grows out of, but goes far beyond, Corot. Indeed the foliage in van Gogh's paintings is so alive, so much a cauldron of primal energy, darkness and light, that it shoots us back to the ages of animism and tree worship described by James George Frazer in ''The Golden Bough.'' It is in the trees that we see most clearly the degree to which van Gogh personified and projected himself into the natural world.\nIn the ''Olive Orchard'' from the Vincent van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, there is an impaled head near the center, as blind as a mole and baring its teeth like a frightened horse. There are faces in profile, mouth open, hair pulled back, in the great ''Pine Trees with Setting Sun.'' This may be the most Chinese work in the show, and Chinese landscape painting, inspired by natural philosophy, has been inhabited by secondary images for centuries.\nThe most startling head is in ''Cypresses.'' The head is, in fact, the entire front cypress. It is facing left, its mouth near the bottom, a nose above it, an eye higher and near the center. It is the head of a pariah, almost a leper, and it seems both stuck in the earth like Bluebeard in the sand, and planted as an offering to the gods. Once the head is recognized, the aggressiveness of the mouth to its immediate right takes on new meaning. Now it is this vulnerable head, not the sky as a whole, that seems threatened.\nWhat is also important here, since it argues for van Gogh's awareness of this soundless cry, is that in the drawing made after the painting, the head of the tree is even clearer; the other cypress in the drawing now suggests a head as well. In the ''Road with Cypress and Star,'' one of the last paintings van Gogh did before leaving Saint-Remy, the big cypress also suggests a head. It is scruffier and less defined than the head in ''Cypresses,'' but it brings to mind van Gogh's self-portraits. It resembles a huge piece of flint against which the sun and moon rub together, and it seems to be on fire.\nThere are also different kinds of secondary imagery in ''Olive Tree with the Alpilles in the Background.'' In the tree just below the maternal cloud there is a head facing left. The head is the foliage. With its mouth open, it seems to be howling like a wolf, or nibbling leaves like a deer, or preaching to the cluster of trees around it. Here, as in ''Cypresses,'' the play between the more literal and the more hidden secondary images transforms a landscape into a stage of astonishing drama.\nSecondary imagery is a messy and controversial subject. In part because there is almost no preparation for it in any form or period of art history, with the notable exception of Surrealism, it is easily mocked and abused. The strong reactions it provokes expose the profound ambivalence about artistic control that is characteristic of this culture's relationship with art.\nOn the one hand, scholars, collectors and members of the art public tend to be attracted to art because it touches aspects of experience that may be unavailable or unwelcome in daily life. Precisely because so little room can often be made for that experience, however, there is at the same time a need to believe that art is not really outside daily convention. Scholars may insist that art can be grasped historically or analytically; collectors may assume they can tame art by pinning it to a wall. The secondary imagery in van Gogh suggests the force of the emotional and psychological currents running through rational channels built to contain them. In the process it reminds us how subversive all great art is.\nNevertheless it should be easier to deal with secondary imagery in van Gogh than in Cezanne, the other late-19th-century artist in whose work it is prominent; secondary images are also present in paintings by the third member of the Post-Impressionist triumvirate, Gauguin. Van Gogh has never been identified with reason. Cezanne, on the other hand, is still seen primarily as the father of Cubism, the progenitor of one of the most analytical approaches in the history of painting. If the expressionist, mystical side of Cezanne's work were more clearly acknowledged, Cubism might be seen differently, perhaps as an attempt to transform the turbulence, instability and passion in Cezanne's paintings into the syntax of a new language.\nMany reasons can be offered why secondary imagery is prominent in this show. It is not there in anywhere near the same degree in the paintings van Gogh did prior to his breakdown in Arles in December 1888. If that crisis further dissolved the skin between himself and his environment, it also left him more isolated. At Saint-Remy his friends really were the trees, fields and hills. If they were his community, his parish, they were also his tempters and judges. It cannot be surprising then that he painted the natural world as an embodiment of his affections and fears.\nVan Gogh was also more alone artistically. When he left Arles and went to Saint-Remy, his style changed. After his crisis with Gauguin, he stopped painting in the broad, flat color areas that had been characteristic of Gauguin and his friends. Indeed in the asylum he stopped painting like anyone. His wavy, choppy, whiplash strokes no longer have the regularity of Impressionist brushwork. The laws of traditional composition were referred to but invariably broken. The way van Gogh worked encouraged the release of a newer and older content, more primitive, more irrational, the kind of content that had traditionally been controlled by academic and systematic means.\nThere are numerous signs that van Gogh knew what was going on in his work. In the 1880's there was a growing tension between a Realist commitment to the visible world and a Symbolist commitment to an invisible world beyond or behind it. The work of Odilon Redon, an artist on good terms with Gauguin, was filled with disembodied heads attached to natural forms or floating in space. The artistic climate was such that once van Gogh noticed heads knocking at the door of his work, he would have been encouraged to invite them in and hear their story.\nIn some paintings in Auvers, there is also a sense that van Gogh was trying to use secondary imagery to regain an inspiration that he never had to struggle for in Saint-Remy. Swollen, caricaturish heads seem to be talking to each other, like two of Daumier's parliamentarians, from the far left and far right of ''Daubigny's Garden'' (from the Hiroshima Museum of Art). But van Gogh himself does not seem to have found their conversation all that engaging. Like the Auvers paintings in general, these heads seem somewhat contrived - perhaps an attempt to project himself into the landscape, to create an identification that was no longer naturally there. Or perhaps they are not only laughing with each other, but at him, in which case they are as disturbing as any of the heads in Saint-Remy. Whatever van Gogh's secondary images may be, they make us feel the heat of his extraordinary creative fire.\nART VIEW

It's very comforting, the last week or two of December, when such things usually take place, to resolve to do good things. And it matters not one whit if these resolutions are broken, abrogated, kaput, the first day or week of the new year.\nNevertheless, there are some, cognizant of the frailty of their wills, who do not wish to tempt even further disillusionment. They refuse to make personal resolutions, although, all things being equal, they like to start the new year with a positive perspective. One of the best ways of doing this is by paying tribute to other people who, with or without the aid of resolutions last year, did unto others what should be done by a lot more. LET'S take cyclists, for example, a group that, with some reason, became more unpopular as each month went by, and remains so. But despite this, there were cyclists who not only knew that they were subject to traffic laws but also obeyed them, and who appreciated, too, that their vehicles could be dangerous. So it's only fair to offer thanks to those men and women on bicycles who didn't speed ahead at red lights, who didn't swoosh around corners and who didn't cavalierly zip along in the wrong direction on one-way streets.\nAnd a rose or an apple or something nice to motorists, taxi drivers included, who made an effort to avoid splattering pedestrians with dirty water during rainstorms. They may not always have succeeded, but at least they tried, by slowing down when they spotted enormous puddles. And perhaps most important of all, they didn't forge ahead as though pedestrians standing at the curb were invisible.\nAnd may the passengers get nicer, and the tips get slightly bigger, for the nine or 10 taxi drivers who actually said ''thank you'' when they were given a tip.\nA nod in the direction of mothers on subways and buses who didn't give the first available seat to their children, while they remained standing. Or who didn't allow a child to remain seated while a considerably older person stood directly in front. And a nod as well to any younger person who sat in the section reserved for the elderly and infirm and immediately vacated the seat when it was needed. There's every possibility that these young people will grow up to be decent human beings. THANK you to token clerks who smiled occasionally and who made an effort to speed things up when a train was pulling into the station. And to bus drivers who responded politely when asked where the bus was going, rather than blaming passengers for the shortcomings of bus signs.\nMajor appreciation to repairmen who telephoned if they were going to be more than 20 or 30 minutes late for an appointment, a sign that they and/ or their employers appreciated that other people's time was at least as valuable as their own.\nWhatever you want may you get, all you salesmen and women who broke off personal conversations when a customer came into sight, and all of you who remained equally pleasant after discovering the transaction was an exchange, rather than a purchase.\nAt least a small bonus to store and bank managers who made some effort to find out what was going on ''out there.'' Who emerged from their offices to see for themselves how long it took customers to get looked after and, if the time was inordinately long, why, and how the situation could be remedied.\nA promotion to company executives everywhere who, every so often, personally looked through the complaint files assembled by their customer-relations departments. A TRULY heartfelt thank-you to hospital attendants who directed their irritation and job frustrations at the proper authorities, rather than at often helpless patients.\nAn entry in the entertaining hall of fame to hosts and hostesses who respected guests' diets and refrained from plaintive remarks such as ''this is my specialty - just try a little,'' or such generalized comments as ''be good tomorrow.'' Dieting is hard enough without the added burden of being made to feel ungrateful. AND an entry in everyone's personal hall of fame for people encountered only occasionally who didn't assume you knew who they were. They came up at parties, or on the street, and began the conversation with ''Hello, I'm Mary (or Tom) Smith and we met a few months ago at the Joneses'.'' Of course, men and women as thoughtful as that were usually remembered anyway, as opposed to those whose greeting was a challenging ''I'll bet you don't remember who I am.''\nFor that group, there's only one answer - ''No, I don't remember who you are, and now I know why.'' So, it's not very nice. But that's a whole other area, and no way to start a new year.

This was originally a six-minute setting for chorus and wind band composed by the philosopher to a poem by Lou Andreas-Salome in the early 1880's. It was subsequently expanded for full orchestra (though deferentially; the winds still predominate) by Nietzsche's friend Peter Gast and published in 1887. One spells out this information because the Brooklyn Philharmonic states in both its news release and its program notes that Gast wrote the poem and that Nietszche merely dedicated his composition to Andreas-Salome, which turns out to have been a simple misreading of the score.\nIn any event, Nietzsche's music, in a conservative mid-19th-century Germanic idiom, seems oddly solemn, even turgid, compared with Andreas-Salome's hot-blooded poetical passion. Still, the music might have made a somewhat better impression had the Grace Choral Society of Brooklyn - which sat dutifully onstage for the entire concert but sang only for a total of nine minutes at the very beginning and very end - sung better. In the Nietzsche, especially, the chorus's squally tone and imbalance in favor of the women's voices made a poor case for the music.\nMr. Foss continued with the New York premiere of Webern's ''Three Orchestral Studies on a Ground,'' part of a cache of early Webern works discovered by the Webern specialist Hans Moldenhauer. Webern's later works are microcosmically concise; these are three scraps, less than four minutes long - sketches for the subsequent 10-minute Passacaglia (Op. 1) - and really of interest only to other Webern experts.\nThe beginning of Schumann's Piano Concerto announced another level of compositional accomplishment, and the performance justified that accomplishment. Bella Davidovich, the soloist, gave a lovely account of her part, eminently poetic yet never lacking in vitality, and Mr. Foss partnered her beautifully. This was small-scaled Schumann, and one was grateful to hear it in this age of big, gleaming, soulless performances.\nMr. Foss's interpretation of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, which followed the intermission, was equally appealing. Mr. Foss seemed to take his basic tempos, fleet and forward-looking, from Arturo Toscanini. But he modified them slightly, and he softened Toscanini's hard-driven contours. This was another scaled-down performance, never miniaturist, but not overbearing, either. This meant some lovely opportunities for sensitive phrasing from the Brooklyn players, yet the finale built to a most satisfying climax.\nOn paper, to follow the ecstasy of Beethoven's Seventh with the conductor Felix Mottl's orchestration of a three-minute Beethoven song, ''Die Ehre Gottes aus der Natur,'' looked like pure anticlimax. It didn't turn out that way.\nMottl, who also orchestrated four of Wagner's five ''Wesendonk Lieder'' (Wagner had already done the fifth), knew what he was about. His translation of this piano-accompanied solo song into a four-part chorus with vigorous late-18th-century-style orchestra sounded like it belonged in one of Haydn's late oratorios. It made for sturdy, satisfying fare, heartily handled by the Grace Choral Society singers, and it provided a delightful and unusual conclusion to a most venturesome program.

''If it is perceived as too lenient, that provokes a reaction, too. Either way, the Government loses control.''\nAccording to official figures, more than 600 people were killed in violence in the Punjab in 1986, many of them in spectacular or gruesome massacres carried out by extremists demanding an independent nation for Sikhs.\nAmong the recent episodes in other parts of India were several days of riots last month by agitators demanding statehood for Goa, a tiny former Portuguese colony on India's western coast. The army had to be called out at the height of the winter tourist season to restore order.\nBefore the Goa riots, Moslems in the nearby state of Karnataka went on a rampage in protest over a short piece of fiction printed in a local newspaper. Separate State Urged\nThe short story was called ''Mohammed the Idiot,'' which Moslems deemed extremely offensive. Seventeen people were killed as rioting spread through the cities of Mysore, Bangalore and several smaller towns within a few days.\nViolence continues, meanwhile, as ethnic Gurkhas in northeastern India agitate for a separate state to be known as Gurkhaland. There have been almost daily reports of new killings in demonstrations and pitched battles among workers on the area's tea plantations.\nIn the southern state of Tamil Nadu, protesters against the use of Hindi as a national language have set off bombs and held mass demnstrations, leading to the detention of as many as 19,000 people.\nThousands of farmers and their organizers were arrested in December in the western state of Maharashtra while trying to block roads in an agitation for higher farm prices. Hundreds of Groupings\nMeanwhile, news organizations reported that more than 100 people died in 1986 as tribal separatists in the remote northeastern state of Tripura clashed with ethnic Bengali plains dwellers.\nFrom the time of independence in 1947, India has had difficulty forging a sense of national unity out of its hundreds of ethnic, linguistic, religious and regional groups and subgroups.\nLanguage has been an especially explosive issue, boiling over into serious riots two decades ago among ethnic Tamils in Tamil Nadu, where there was talk of secession two decades ago.\nThe history of such conflicts has led aides to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to caution against drawing any conclusion that India is suddenly coming apart at the seams. Dangerous Trends Seen\nIn an interview, an aide to Mr. Gandhi noted that the language agitations in Tamil Nadu had not even approached the level of those in the 1960's. He said that other problems in Goa, Karnataka and elsewhere were isolated in nature.\n''In this country, it takes very little to start a new round of ethnic violence because tensions are always beneath the surface,'' he said. ''We have to keep things in perspective.''\nBut critics of Mr. Gandhi say his Government may be ignoring some dangerous trends behind the violence. Perhaps the most serious of these is the way that it seems to have spread so quickly as to suggest that it was highly organized. 'Determined Professionals'\nThe Moslem protest over the short story in one city in Karnataka state, for example, touched off immediate similar protests elsewhere. There were even clashes between Moslems and the police in the faraway Moslem-dominated state of Kashmir in the north.\n''In the earlier days, rioting tended to be spontaneous,'' said Rajni Kothari, a leading civil liberties advocate in New Delhi. ''What you're getting now are a bunch of determined professionals backed by hired mobs.''\nFor Mr. Kothari, two separate waves of violence in the last few years foreshadowed this trend. First were the anti-Sikh riots in the nation's capital after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by two Sikh security guards in 1984.\nSome 2,500 Sikhs were killeed in those riots, and Mr. Kothari and others have long charged that they were organized or encouraged by leading politicians allied with Mrs. Gandhi and her son and successor. These politicians deny the charges. A Police Crackdown\nNext came the violence involving Hindus, Moslems and lower caste groups in the western state of Gujarat in 1985, where 250 people died over five months.\nThe killings stopped abruptly after the police cracked down on what they said were organized groups seeking revenge on each other.\nAs in many of the recent flare-ups, the police blame ''antisocial elements'' and ''miscreants'' for fomenting the violence.
654	RIVERA MURAL IN MEXICO AWAITS ITS NEW SHELTER	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D81238F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 1 -\nMEXICO CITY, Jan. 1 -\nLounging in the central park, or alameda, of a Mexican village, gossiping with friends and purchasing snacks from a pushcart vendor is a favorite way to pass a Sunday in Mexico, even in crowded Mexico City, where the central park is a particularly beautiful one.\nAs a small boy, Mexico's great muralist Diego Rivera went to Mexico City's alameda on a Sunday, lounging with his parents, just as hundreds of people do today, nearly a century later.\nA decade before he died in 1957, Diego Rivera painted a large fresco called ''Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Central Alameda,'' in which the trees of the park embrace a Rivera-esque fantasy. Painted in the Hotel del Prado across the street from the alameda, the mural embraced the centuries of history the park had seen, from the Spanish Inquisition to the Mexican revolution.\nThe mural has been in the hotel ever since, first in the dining room and then in the lobby.\nThe hotel, once a fashionable tourist spot but a bit in decline in recent years, was seriously damaged during the earthquakes that struck Mexico City 15 months ago, killing thousands of people and destroying hundreds of buildings. The hotel came close to collapsing and has been closed ever since, but the mural survived with only a few tiny cracks. Mural Moved 100 Yards\nAlthough the timing was a bit of an accident, park loungers were treated to a unique spectacle three weeks ago, just six days after the master's 100th birthday.\nMr. Rivera's mural, all 77,000 pounds of it encased in foam rubber, wood, and steel girders to hold it rigid, was extracted from a second-floor lobby window of the del Prado by an enormous crane and loaded onto a flatbed truck.\nThe truck carried it ever so slowly and gently 100 yards to a new site where the mural was settled onto a concrete platform, the workers treating the giant apparatus as if it were filled with thousands of eggs.\nIn the coming months, a building will be built around it and a salon created. There, government art conservationists hope, the mural will remain permanently, and safe from earthquakes, a national artistic treasure that all who come to the alameda can view.\nAs did so many of Mr. Rivera's murals, the alameda mural instantly generated heated controversy because the artist, an avowed atheist and Communist, tucked away a small scroll in the work that said, ''God does not exist.''\nHistorians recount how demonstrators stormed the hotel and slashed the fresco, which Mr. Rivera repaired.\nIn 1956, little more than a year before his death, Mr. Rivera made peace with the Roman Catholic Church and changed the wording on the scroll to merely reflect the 19th-century meeting at which a Mexican politician had spoken the words.\nAfter making the change, he descended from the scaffold and told waiting reporters, ''I am a Catholic.'' More Than a Year of Study\n''We knew the day of the earthquake that regardless of what happened to the hotel the mural would have to be moved,'' said Juan Urquiaga, a Government architect who is head of the Office of Architecture and Conservation of National Artistic Heritage. ''We've spent more than a year studying the problem and getting ready for the move.''\nMr. Rivera, who was paid 512 pesos per square meter for his work - or about $4,300 for the entire mural -painted the fresco on a bed of plaster placed in a heavy steel frame. It measured 49 feet 3 inches by 15 feet 9 inches and was one of the last great murals he painted.\nThe frame is mounted within a massive system of steel girders, held together by a forest of steel-girder bracing so that the mural is not subjected to any twisting movements that might crack the plaster.\nThe weight of the work confounded the architects and engineers in the last year as they pondered the mural's future.\n''Everyone felt it should be next to the alameda, or at least very close to the alameda,'' Mr. Urquiaga said.\n''We considered placing it in the Fine Arts Palace, but the columns of that building are too close together.''\nAnother government museum behind the fine arts building and a block from the alameda had a second-floor salon long enough to accommodate the mural.\nBut when engineers began studying the 19th-century building, they had visions of the mural, girders and all, crashing down to the first floor should someone slam a door too hard, or during Mexico City's next earthquake.\nEventually, it became clear that the government would have to build a structure.\nAnother hotel across the street from both the Hotel del Prado and the alameda did collapse during the earthquake. In its place, the government built another park. The adjacent site where the hotel parking lot stood was vacant, and this was chosen for the mural. Earthquake-Proof\nIn the weeks prior to the move, while workers labored amid the ruins of the second-floor lobby of the del Prado to prepare the mural, other workers hurried to lay the concrete foundation of a new building.\nThey prepared a pedestal 50 feet long and 5 feet wide onto which the mural would be lowered by the crane and fastened in place.\nThe plan is to build the walls and roof of the salon around the mural, solving the problem of maneuvering the unwieldy object through a door or window of some other structure.\nMoreover, by constructing the salon with enough structural steel to satisfy the designer of any modern bank vault, Diego Rivera's masterpiece will be earthquake-proof.\nAt the del Prado, a platform was built extending out of the second-floor lobby window into Juarez Avenue. Dozens of steel casters were placed under the mural.\nOn the day of the move, the crane pulled the mural out of the hotel onto the platform and then lifted it onto the truck for the trip to the new foundation.\n''Our biggest problem was avoiding the possibility of any torsion when the mural was moved,'' Mr. Urquiaga said. ''But the steel structure is so well braced, we don't think there will be any damage.''\nBut it will likely be several months before the art conservationists find out if they succeeded.\nFor the move, the face of the mural was covered with cloth, polyurethane cushioning material and then a sturdy wooden cover.\nThat will remain in place until the salon is completed and there is no danger of bad weather affecting the fresco.\n''We will remove the cover, clean the mural and repair any cracks. Our hope is there will be no cracks beyond the few small ones that resulted from the earthquake,'' Mr. Urquiaga said.

For the most part, the subscribers are French students and universities.\n''Language-lab tapes are so boring for the most part,'' Mr. Green said. ''One of the real problems with learning language here is that it is so terribly remote. There's nothing exciting about it. But foreign culture is interesting.''

''It has the compelling quality of a living document.''\nChamps Elysees tapes have been broadcast on the campus radio station, Mr. Honigsbloom said.\nMr. Green, a former disk jockey at WSM and WLAC in Nashville, said the idea originated three years ago when a former company of his, Nashville Radio Workshop, was sending Grand Ole Opry broadcasts to RTL.\n''I worked out a deal with Georges Lang,'' Mr. Green said. ''I asked him if he'd be willing to do the programs.''\nThree hundred subscribers received the first tapes from the company, which is a family business that Mr. Green, his mother, Edna, and brother, Mark, co-own.\nDominique Laurent, a Vanderbilt doctoral student in French, writes the transcript and glossary with Prof. Jean LeBlanc, a Vanderbilt French instructor, serving as editorial consultant.\nThe format is similar to typical French-language radio news magazines, using background music from classical through new wave to accentuate the rapid-fire broadcast. On the tape, the French is spoken at a moderate pace.\nThe success of the French tape has prompted the company to expand. ''We're starting German this month,'' said Mr. Green, who attended Aiglon College in Montreux, Switzerland, and graduated with a degree in German from Vanderbilt University.\nA subscription costs $112 for 14 tapes and transcripts, sent from September to March, Mr. Green said.
656	Living With Shutter-Speed Limits	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D81238F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: ONE of the longstanding complaints about 35-millimeter single-lens reflex cameras is that their shutters can synchronize with electronic flash units only at relatively slow speeds. Back in the dark ages, the top speed was 1/30-second, then it went to 1/60-second. There it rested until a few years ago, when 1/125- and even 1/250-second ''sync'' speeds became possible.\nONE of the longstanding complaints about 35-millimeter single-lens reflex cameras is that their shutters can synchronize with electronic flash units only at relatively slow speeds. Back in the dark ages, the top speed was 1/30-second, then it went to 1/60-second. There it rested until a few years ago, when 1/125- and even 1/250-second ''sync'' speeds became possible.\nThe limitation on shutter speed with flash is caused by the kind of shutter used in 35-millimeter cameras with interchangeable lenses. It is called a focal-plane shutter, and it consists of two curtains that during exposure slide across the rectangular area in front of the film, one chasing the other. As the first one moves, it exposes the film; the second covers it up again. At slow speeds, they move slowly; at fast speeds, they zip across. And when they zip across at very high speeds, the second curtain often begins to follow the first curtain before the first curtain has cleared the film area, creating a slit that moves across the film.\nUsed with a constant light source, the small slit is not a problem. The gap between the two curtains moves across the film plane at a constant size and speed, insuring an even exposure. But if the light is virtually instantaneous, as it is with the light from an electronic flash, only part of the film receives the full exposure at very high shutter speeds; the speeding curtains block off the rest. If you have ever made a flash picture that turned out with a black band on one edge or the other, that is the reason.\nThe design of leaf shutters, which are inside the lens, allows them to function with flash at all marked speeds - usually up to 1/500-second.\nMakers of focal-plane shutters have long labored to end their flash inferiority complex. They've used titanium instead of fabric to lighten the weight of the curtains, and they've stood the shutter sideways, so the curtains go top to bottom instead of side to side. These innovations account for the 1/125- and 1/250-second top sync speeds found on some current SLR's. But as yet no one has invented a shutter to match the leaf shutter's 1/500-second with flash.\nThere is, however, another way to solve the problem, as Olympus, a camera maker known for its design ingenuity, has discovered. Instead of trying to shoehorn more speed into the shutter, the Olympus designers decided to think about changing the nature of the electronic flash. A typical flash duration is about 1/1,000 second. What, they thought, if it were even shorter, and instead of one burst there were several? From this kernel was born the Olympus F280 flash, the first flash to allow focal-plane shutter synchronization at any speed, even at 1/2,000- second.\nThe F280's flash tube can create brief blasts of light at a rate of 20 kilohertz, or 20,000 pulses a second. The light may not be more powerful than a locomotive, but the continual pulsing adds up at slower speeds. Moreover, the system is mated to Olympus's automatic-flash exposure system, which measures the light off the film. So with either the Olympus OM-4T or the new OM-77AF cameras, proper exposure is taken care of by the electronics in the camera.\nThere always seems to be a hitch in any innovation of this magnitude, and the fly in the F280's ointment is that it delivers less light to the film at fast speeds. This is because the number of pulses of light that hit the film decreases as the size of the slit between the shutter curtains decreases.\nWhat if you want to use the flash system but your camera doesn't carry an Olympus nameplate? Chances are excellent the electronics won't mate, so the automatic-exposure feature won't function.\nWhat about other Olympus owners? If they have cameras with off-the-film exposure sensing, they can use the F280 in the same way as any Olympus ''T''-model flash, according to the camera maker.\nSome readers of this column have written me about camera equipment they want to sell or trade. Much as I am interested in such a marketplace, I am unable to provide any bulletin-board space for such exchanges. Nor can I function as a shopping adviser. But I remain eager to hear all comments and suggestions, including questions about picture-taking that might have widespread interest. Please leave last bullet where it is.\nCAMERA
657	NO END IN SIGHT FOR ANNUAL HARVESTS OF DEBT	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED81238F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: ALTHOUGH he didn't need to campaign to keep his job last year, Senator Tom Harkin stumped as hard as he had in every national election since his first race for Congress in 1972. What he wanted was new support for his own approach to farm problems. ''There's only one cure for what ails farmers,'' he told audiences over and over, ''and that's a decent price in the marketplace.\nALTHOUGH he didn't need to campaign to keep his job last year, Senator Tom Harkin stumped as hard as he had in every national election since his first race for Congress in 1972. What he wanted was new support for his own approach to farm problems. ''There's only one cure for what ails farmers,'' he told audiences over and over, ''and that's a decent price in the marketplace.'' The only sure medicine, he said, would be Government-mandated cuts in the crops they raise.\nAdministration specialists, meanwhile, were attacking farm problems from a different angle. They want to continue lessening Government intervention in farmers' decisions, by removing incentives for them to add to the mountains of surpluses.\nOne goal was the same on both sides - to reduce the record $25-billion cost of the farm program approved by Congress in 1985. But some farm economists are defending that program, arguing that, with some refinements, it might be the best plan available.\nIn the new Congress that convenes in Washington this week, a great deal of verbal ammunition will be fired in defense of each of those positions. All Americans have a great deal at stake in the outcome, because it will affect not only their tax or food dollars but also the nation's economic growth. With its related industries, from the plow and the seed to the supermarket, agriculture employs 21 million workers, more than any other sector in the economy.\nWhatever change emerges, if any does, experts say, the results are likely to be costly. The uncertainties are who the heaviest losers are likely to be, by how much, and how the costs are likely to be paid.\nHardly anyone has more at stake than the farmers, many of whom have already gone through five years of deepening financial trouble. Their long-term problems arose not so much from the low prices that Senator Harkin decries as from debts. An expansion spree that began in the early 1970's, when the export market was booming, left them owing $200 billion. About $50 billion of that will never be repaid, according to Abner Womack, who heads a study group at the University of Missouri. Farmers who owe it will lose land, equipment and, in many instances, everything. Many Farmers Stay Afloat\nOf course, not all farmers are in distress. Many with large farms who avoided the debt trap are doing quite well. Those who raise poultry and livestock are profiting from low prices for feed grains. For growers of staple crops - wheat, corn, cotton and rice - a system of benefits offset most of the effects of the price declines that the 1985 law deliberately pursued as a way to make American goods more competitive abroad. Farm prices overall fell 5.5 percent in the past year, the Agriculture Department reported last week; food processors and consumers benefited, but other nations matched the low prices, keeping American exports flat and surpluses high.\nThe 1985 law was designed to raise subsidies in nearly equal proportion to declines in farm prices and to guarantee producers a return close to a preset ''target.'' The target price for corn, for example, is $3.03 a bushel, which experts say is well above the cash cost of growing it in the Corn Belt. To achieve the target, the law provides two types of assistance, a price-support loan and a direct payment. The ''loan rate'' sets a minimum return that the farmer can expect for his crop; this year that minimum in most areas is about $1.80 a bushel. Market prices are lower than that, so most farmers are pledging their corn to the Government in return for $1.80-a-bushel loans. Next, they receive direct ''deficiency payments'' to make up most of the difference between the loan rate and the target price. The law includes an additional subsidy that enables farmers to redeem the corn they pledged as collateral for the loans and to dump it on the market, further depressing prices.\nSenator Harkin and Representative Richard Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, have offered a plan that they say would strengthen the farm sector while cutting the taxpayers' costs to little or nothing. It would impose sharp cuts in farm production in an effort to achieve the Senator's ''cure for what ails farmers'' -a ''decent price'' well above current levels. The Government would make no direct payments but would set the loan rate much higher, while sharply limiting what a farmer could sell in the United States.\nThe plan's most obvious aspect is that it would transfer the cost of supporting farm income from the Treasury to the marketplace. And critics argue that the heaviest share of the burden, in proportion to ability to pay, would fall on low-income families.\n''It would transfer the burden from a progressive tax system to the consumer,'' said Terry Barr, former director of the Agriculture Department's economics staff. As a result, he said, even while they paid more than ever before for their food, many consumers would be forced to choose less expensive varieties. And, he said, jobs would be lost as consumers were forced to eat more of their meals at home and to buy fewer processed foods.\n''The effect would be to impose a sales tax on food, which is the most regressive sales tax we use,'' said Marty Strange, a Nebraska economist who is a director of the Center for Rural Affairs, a nonprofit research group. ''It could have a severe impact. The poorest families could be spending half their income on food and still be living on bread and beans.''\nHowever, he noted that the bill's authors ''do try to recognize that by proposing an increase in food stamps.'' And he found ''some merit'' in the plan as a way to manage an inevitable ''disinvestment'' in an agricultural establishment that has overexpanded.\nAdministration farm specialists are advocating a less drastic but more unusual wrinkle on the old farm program. Besides proposing a 10-percent cut in income supports and a $50,000-a-farm limit, they want to ''decouple'' the benefits from the production. In other words, a farmer could receive as much as $50,000 even if he decided to plant a new crop or nothing at all. Now a corn farmer, for example, must keep planting corn to maintain his rights to benefits, whether or not anyone needs any more corn.\nSome Washington experts are skeptical about the chances of either alternative to current law. One of those is Mr. Barr, the former Agriculture Department official. ''I'm not sure you could get farmers to go along'' with the Administration proposal, he said, because a payment without reference to what they produce is too much like welfare.\nOf the present program, he said, ''So we spent $25 billion for farm supports. That $25 billion is not all that big when you compare it with everything else in the budget and you consider what it buys. There must have been at least $10 billion of that passed along to consumers in lower food costs.''\nMartin Abel, a Washington consultant, agreed. ''Our analysis is that, with refinements, the existing law will look better and better,'' he said. ''At least it is an approach that leads to lower food prices.''

In one of the largest and most expensive conversions of apartments to cooperatives in New York City, the 12,000 tenants who live in the 3,800 apartments must decide within the next three months whether to continue renting or to step into the New York real-estate market by buying their apartments.\nThose who continue to rent may stay in their apartments, which are covered by the city's rent-stabilization law, as long as they wish. Rents now range from $115 a room to $375 a room. Those who decide to buy - at prices well below the market - face a second decision: whether to stay in their new cooperative, or immediately sell it for a large profit.\nThe price for current residents of the complex has been set at $30,500 a room, under an agreement negotiated between the Association of Tenants of Lincoln Towers and the owners - a partnership headed by the Mendik Realty Company and principals of M. J. Raynes Inc. The price for outsiders, however, will be $68,000 a room - meaning that insiders should be able to buy their own apartments and then resell them for a profit of more than 120 percent.\nBy the end of the conversion, real estate valued at $900 million will have been offered for sale.\n''I just don't know where I would go,'' said Olga Albizu, who moved into her apartment in 1966 and thinks that she will probably stay on as a tenant.\n''I still like New York,'' she said, ''and I'm also concerned that there might be a glut on apartments. I hate to get saddled with a mortgage and I don't really like to owe money.''\nWhen asked why, in that case, she would even consider buying, she smiled. ''Greed,'' she said.\nDebbie Gold, a young woman who is a life insurance agent, said she had heard that real-estate agents were giving tenants inflated figures on the resale value of their apartments. Other tenants voiced concern that if many people bought their apartments and then tried to resell them, there would be a glut on the market and prices would drop.\n''People think their apartments are worth more than they are,'' Ms. Gold said. ''People think they are going to buy and sell in three weeks. Everyone sees dollar signs.''\nSam Paryzer, who operates a telephone company, is thinking about buying not only his apartment but also his outdoor parking space, a treasured commodity on the Upper West Side. There are 400 outdoor parking spaces in Lincoln Towers, which covers 20 acres on both sides of West End Avenue from 66th to 70th Streets, and 1,100 spaces in an underground garage.\nMr. Paryzer's parking space will cost him $18,000, plus monthly maintenance that would be raised in yearly increments until it reached $143 a month four years from now.\nThe eight-building complex was built between 1960 and 1964 by Webb & Knapp, a company headed by William Zeckendorf that was one of the country's largest real-estate operations.\nOne of the principal drawing cards of Lincoln Towers is that it is only a few blocks from Lincoln Center. A number of older tenants said in interviews that one of their luxuries was being able to walk to and from performances, even at night, when they said they felt relatively safe because of the Lincoln Center crowds.\nTenants, though, are worried about plans announced by Donald J. Trump to build a huge complex of tall buildings between Lincoln Towers and the Hudson River.\nGladys Gruenwald, who has a lovely river view from her 18th-floor apartment, says she will probably buy her apartment, Mr. Trump and his view-blocking plans notwithstanding.\n''I have a neighbor who has been worrying about the view for 10 years,'' she said. ''I just enjoy it and don't worry about it.''\nThe owners have agreed to put the building into as good shape as possible before conversion - including the replacement of all windows and all terrace doors, the installation of a new roof on each building and the replacement of all elevator controls.\nOne reason to put the buildings in such good condition, according to a number of tenants, is to avoid ending up with two classes of residents, as has happened in some buildings that have both rentals and co-ops. In those buildings, the rental apartments still have the old drafty windows, faulty heating and dilapidated kitchens, while the newer ones tend to have been modernized by their owners.\nThe improvements were negotiated by the tenants association, which had clout, thanks to 75 percent of the tenants signing a no-buy pledge, according to the association president, Janice F. Hohenstein. Under that pledge, they promised not to buy their apartments unless released from the agreement by the association.\nMs. Hohenstein said the population of Lincoln Towers was split between the older tenants, many of whom had moved into their current apartments more than 20 years ago, and younger people with families, who had come within the last 10 years.\nSadye Curtis, who is 88 years old and only retired from her work in advertising a few months ago, moved into her three-and-a-half-room, balconied apartment 16 years ago. Her rent was then $286 and is now $575.\nShe could buy the apartment for $101,000, but the kitchen has just been renovated and the apartment is filled with eastern sunlight and memories and she thinks she will just stay on as a tenant.\nShira Dicker, a reporter who covers the diamond industry for National Jeweler magazine, moved into her one-bedroom apartment with her husband and newborn baby two and a half years ago. They partitioned off the dining-el to make a baby's room, but they are now outgrowing the space. They would also like to have another child.\n''In Manhattan, you have to plan your family around the availability of apartment space,'' Ms. Dicker said ruefully.\nThe family will enter the tenants lottery in which vacant apartments will be offered for sale by the owners of the building at a price somewhere between the insider and outsider prices. Ms. Dicker hopes to get one of the 23 two-bedroom apartments.\nShe says getting such an apartment in the lottery will mean the difference between being able to afford staying on in New York City or moving to the suburbs.\n''We're going to enter the lottery and pray and hope,'' said Ms. Dicker, who now lives about 15 minutes from her job in midtown. ''If we don't, it will probably mean that I would join the millions of people who wake up every morning at 6:30 A.M., instead of 8:30 A.M.'' THE TALK OF LINCOLN TOWERS

Hearing Held in September\n''They said it gave a poor image to the public,'' Mr. Trivisonno said. ''We were irate. What about the toll collectors? They see millions of people. And what about Stephen Berger, the executive director of the Port Authority? He's had a beard for years.''\nMr. Berger was out of town on vacation and could not be reached for comment.\nA hearing was held Sept. 19 and Mr. Mastriani dated his ruling Dec. 22. Mr. Trivisonno said he received it in the mail last Wednesday.\nMr. Mastriani wrote, according to Mr. Trivisonno, that the order was ''unreasonable'' because it referred to all facility operations agents, ''regardless of job function or duty'' and violated the contract.\nA Port Authority spokesman, Joe Lanciotti, said that, as of Friday evening, the authority had not received an official notice of an arbitrator's decision. He said he did not know whether it planned to change the policy or appeal the ruling.\nAccording to Mr. Trivisonno, the arbitrator wrote that, until a new policy was negotiated, the employer had a right to prohibit beards for those workers assigned in any capacity in which facial hair constitutes a safety hazard.\nAnother agency spokesman, Armando Arrastia, said the main reason for requiring the facility operations agents to be clean shaven was because they, at times, must wear breathing masks while fighting fires or entering contaminated areas.\nThe ruling does not apply to about 1,000 Port Authority police, but it does apply to the 1,200 toll collectors, tow-truck operators, tunnel workers, sky caps and airport operations agents represented by Local 1400.

There, though a stroke three years ago has left him in constant pain and barely able to walk, he slowly makes his way from an apartment to a classroom building at the Elchanan Theological Seminary, where 70 rabbinical students fill a classroom and listen attentively to the man they call Rav Aaron.\nSeated behind a desk cluttered with Jewish texts, the 69-year-old rabbi -considered one of the world's foremost Talmudic scholars and authorities on Jewish law - begins the two-hour shiur, or class, slowly articulating complex laws of betrothal and numerous opinions of rabbinic sages recorded throughout the ages.\n''It's as if he has the entire Talmud before his very eyes,'' said a second-year rabbinical student from Pascagoula, Miss., Fivel Smiles. Torah,the oral and written law, ''is his life, his therapy.'' A Study in Human Character\nAfter suffering his stroke, Rav Aaron continued his teaching in Chicago. And this year, when the Elchanan seminary asked him to come teach a twice-weekly class, the rabbi accepted without hesitation, despite the hardships involved.\n''I don't know how people can retire,'' said the rabbi. ''It's sadistic. One's mind begins to rot.'' To his students and colleagues at the seminary, which is affiliated with Yeshiva University, Rav Aaron is a study in human character as profound as the centuries-old Talmudic texts he has taught for 40 years.\n''It's a wonder how such a frail shell can possess a power and enthusiasm that mesmerizes his audiences,'' said the seminary's director, Rabbi Zevulun Charlop. ''You're so taken by his spirit and dynamism, that you don't notice the physical ailment after a while.''\n''His courage and determination to teach the Torah cannot be stopped,'' said a postgraduate student, Rabbi Joshua Hoffman, who has studied with Rav Aaron for the last seven years. A Difficult Task\nBut after rehabilitation, including, most recently, regular treatments of acupuncture, effects of the stroke on the rabbi's body remain. The daily walk from his apartment on Yeshiva's campus on Amsterdam Avenue and 185th Street to an adjacent classroom building takes nearly a half hour.\n''Do you know what it's like to tie my shoes or to put the tefilin on my hand?'' he asked, holding out his shaking left hand and pointing to where he binds the traditional phylacteries each morning. ''It's as difficult as parting the Red Sea.\n''I try to elevate myself through my suffering,'' said the rabbi. ''I'm in constant pain. But when I give a shiur, I don't feel it as much.''\nFor the rabbi, the opportunity to return to the seminary - where at least one member of the Soloveitchik family has taught since 1929 and where he himself taught for six years in the 1960's - is of special significance.\n''It's an invigorating feeling to teach at the school where my brother and father have taught,'' said the rabbi, who has six children, four of whom are rabbis, and 22 grandchildren. ''I have feelings of trepidation and excitement.''\nHis father, Rabbi Moshe Soloveitchik, was a noted scholar in several Eastern European communities before joining the Seminary in 1929. After Rabbi Moshe's death, Rav Aaron's older brother, Dr. Joseph Ber Soloveitchik, became the Seminary's pre-eminent scholar, remaining there 46 years until 1985 when poor health forced him to give up his classes.\nRav Aaron, a graduate of Yeshiva College in 1940 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, earned a law degree from New York University in 1946. In Chicago, where he has lived since 1966, he founded the Yeshiva of Brisk in 1974 to honor his family.\nThe challenge for stroke victims, the rabbi wrote in an essay from his hospital bed in 1983, ''is to galvanize one's moral and spiritual potential.''\n''I've never allowed myself to become victimized and frustrated by the stroke,'' he said. ''With God's help, I have been strengthened.''

Several minutes later she heard a commotion by the slot machines and learned that Mr. Henhaffer had won the large jackpot.\nMr. Henhaffer told the jury he was not using Ms. Quitmeyer's coins because he had purchased a $10 roll of quarters and had received 13 coins from his wife.\nMs. Quitmeyer filed suit when Mr. Henhaffer refused to acknowledge she was entitled to any money.

This antiquarian exercise has obscured unpleasant truths about the men who created our nation.\nThere is no question that many founders harbored doubts about the justice of slavery and that some -like Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton - can be called abolitionists. Yet no amount of selective quotation can refute that the Constitution strengthened rather than weakened slavery.\nThe three-fifths clause gave the South extra representation and electoral votes for its disenfranchised slave population. Congress was prohibited for 20 years from outlawing the infamous Atlantic slave trade. And the fugitive-slave clause required that blacks fleeing to liberty must be returned to their owners, thus placing the authority of the new Federal Government behind the institution's stability.\nIt is true, as one correspondent (Dec. 20) noted, that Jefferson included a ringing condemnation of the slave trade and slavery in an early draft of the Declaration of Independence, only to see it deleted at the insistence of South Carolina and Georgia. Yet this clause placed the blame for blacks' condition on King George III, a piece of sophistry that suggests the colonists were not prepared to face their own responsibility for slavery's introduction and continued existence.\nFor all his private statements, Jefferson all his life owned slaves, bought and sold them like any other planter, and believed blacks innately inferior. Unlike Washington, he did not free his slaves in his will. Jefferson's 1818 letter to Mordechai Noah condemning anti-Semitism has received much publicity. But Noah himself held deeply racist attitudes toward blacks and was an outspoken defender of slavery. Like Jefferson, his definition of inalienable rights had its limits.\nTo face up to the Founders' racist views and complicity in the institution of slavery does not diminish their many achievements. But an understanding of how deeply embedded slavery and racism were in the society that produced the Constitution may perhaps enable Americans to appreciate the unique barriers this nation has erected against blacks' advancement, and the historical roots of our current racial institutions and attitudes.

Bowen, Secretary of Health and Human Services, to add an increment of protection to Medicare with a modest ''catastrophic'' benefit, for a premium of $4.92 a month.

They did not bother about details, but, ''There was general agreement that no further Government support of long-term care expense should be advocated.'' Besides, ''States, through Medicaid and other local programs, already provide substantial resources for long-term care.''

That night, the students held a sit-in, which led to a military assault by Jordanian security forces. Many students were beaten, then arrested. At least three were killed (the figure is probably a good deal higher). Soon after, a Government report blamed the university administration for the disturbances, and the president was forced to resign.\nOn July 12, the contracts of 15 professors and 6 administrators were summarily terminated. A ministerial committee found no evidence of subversive activity in the university. The only link between the 21 and their dismissal was that they had shown concern for their students.\nAl Yarmouk University is run by the Jordanian Government, and so the dismissal of the 21 was intended as a crude punitive device to deter expression of opinion on matters of concern to the university community.\nAmong the professors dismissed are some of the ablest humanists, scientists and social scientists in the Arab world, many with an important international reputation. Their dismissal has meant they face the prospects of no alternative employment in Jordan. All have tried to fight their dismissal on legal grounds, but since their opponent is the Government, none of these means have been successful.\nAs academics and scholars in the United States, we view these measures by Jordan with the gravest concern. For not only have scholars and administrators been dismissed without due process, but also their civil and academic rights have been brutally violated.

In fact, you have to think hard to remember an Administration so earnestly pleased with itself in face of the facts. This year's budget deficit is estimated at $170 billion to $180 billion.\nThe Administration is at the beginning of a difficult new year, but so far it does not seem to be at the beginning of any serious new policy review. In fact, you have to think hard to remember an Administration so earnestly pleased with itself in face of the facts. This year's budget deficit is estimated at $170 billion to $180 billion. In November the trade deficit jumped to $19.5 billion and will come out for the year at about $173.6 billion, $25 billion over last year's record shortfall.\nStill, President Reagan proposes an overall budget of $1,024.3 billion for fiscal l988 and $1.8 trillion for the Pentagon over the next five years, while cutting farm aid by more than half and reducing many other domestic programs.\nIn short, despite the President's mystifying optimism about home and foreign policy, the record is not very good, and not only because of unavoidable problems but also because of avoidable stupidities.\nA few changes have been made at the White House. Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North have gone to their well-deserved banishment, others including William Casey of the C.I.A. are thinking longingly of home, and Frank Carlucci is tidying up the muddle at the National Security Council. But otherwise, the top men are not really taking responsibility for the Iran-contra scandals but are trying to evade them by cleverness, which got them into the mess in the first place.\nThis may change, however, when the 100th Congress convenes and the Democrats put forward their own view of the state of the Union.\nNobody, of course, can know what that funny bunch will do, with their minds on the next election. They have won only two of the last five Presidential contests (both by Southerners) and many of them, intimidated by the President's popularity in the past, may be howling calamity and rejoicing too much over his recent troubles.\nBut the new Speaker of the House, Jim Wright of Texas, and the new majority leader, Thomas Foley of Washington, are not likely to make that mistake. They and the moderate chairmen of the Senate committees like Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Sam Nunn of Georgia will have plenty to say about the trade deficit and the President's nuclear policies; but nobody expects a runaway Congress, except perhaps in the committees established to investigate the sneaking of money to Iran and the contras.\nMuch will depend on the President's mood after he returns from the hospital and signs off on his own State of the Union address. He can either go on defying the Congress or seek bipartisan support in his last two years, but he can't do both. It is in the field of arms control that his best hope lies, and he seemed to realize this in his New Year's message to the Soviet people.\nReferring to his meeting with General Secretary Gorbachev in Iceland last October, he said:\n''We did move things a good distance forward. On many issues, we made more progress in two days than our diplomats made in the last two years. Yes, a great deal of work remains, but both sides are closer now than ever before.''\nMr. Gorbachev was more critical but he was also careful. It may seem after last year that no more surprises are possible, but the biggest surprise of l987 may very well be that the mutual interest of these two nuclear nations in avoiding another round in a protracted arms race finally will produce a verifiable compromise.\nWhat is not in the cards is a dramatic breakthrough to a foolproof nuclear ''shield'' in outer space or a world free of all nuclear weapons by l996. The President's choice is likely to be agreement on substantial cuts in Soviet offensive weapons and some constraints on his space-based defense system, or no agreement on strategic arms during his last act on the White House stage.\nHere again the President has a chance to change his approach to this most important question of world politics by bringing leaders of the other party into serious consultation and negotiation as Roosevelt and Truman did with the Republicans at the end of the last world war and as Eisenhower did with the Democrats during his two terms.\nOnly the President, however, can initiate such changes, and the Democrats could not refuse to cooperate if he did. But the terms of negotiation will have to be modified from utopian movie scripts to more realistic policies.\nTogether the President and the new Congress could give common sense a shove in l987 (''It will be better,'' he promised), but only if Mr. Reagan really wants a new beginning with the Congress and the Russians.
670	Eligibility Standards Are Eased	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DC1338F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THE loans offered by state-chartered mortgage agencies have lost some of their appeal since savings banks and other conventional lenders began aggressively promoting their own exceptionally low interest rates last fall.\nTHE loans offered by state-chartered mortgage agencies have lost some of their appeal since savings banks and other conventional lenders began aggressively promoting their own exceptionally low interest rates last fall.\nThese agencies have traditionally helped moderate-income buyers by offering mortgages at below-market rates, raising funds by issuing tax-exempt bonds. In some cases, however, rates are available in the private sector that are as low as those offered by the government agencies.\nMoreover, new restrictions on the use of tax-exempt bonds in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 spawned rumors that such loans would no longer be available and created the impression that it would be a waste of time to seek them this year.\nIn fact, however, not only are these agencies finding new ways to remain in business, but they also are relaxing their guidelines so that more people and properties should be eligible this year. They will also be gradually lowering their rates, so the traditional benefits of below-market-cost financing should still make their offerings worth exploring.\nTheir fixed-rate loans also provide safer vehicles for borrowers whose future income may be uncertain. For example, John Mendoza, a chef, and his wife, Ruth, who just bought their first home in East Hartford, Conn., for $95,000, chose an agency loan rather than a bank loan last fall even though the banks were offering slightly better terms for a variable-rate loan.\n''When you live on a tight budget you worry about the variable rate,'' Mrs. Mendoza said. ''And we couldn't be sure our income would go up even if rates were going up.''\nThere is no question that these agencies will be in a strong financial position to make an abundant amount of loans. To insure a continued flow of funds, for example, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority will be recycling substantial funds from the repayment of older loans, which are exempt from the Federal limits on new issues designed to curtail lending activity.\nThe New Jersey Housing and Finance Mortgage Agency started negotiations with state banking officials last fall to make sure it would receive a sufficiently large portion of the state's total allowable amount of tax-exempt bonds to cover anticipated needs.\n''We expect to have no trouble meeting our demand, at least until 1988,'' said James L. Logue 3d, the executive director.\nAnd Sonny Mae, the State of New York Mortgage Agency, will have 18 percent more money to lend this year than last because of a higher-than-normal bond issue at the end of last year coupled with the recycling of old funds.\nIt is hardly surprising, therefore, that Sonny Mae, flush with money and facing severe competition from the conventional lenders, is making some of the more dramatic changes. One of the most helpful for buyers is its changeover to a constant lending pattern rather than periodic offerings.\n''You couldn't always find the house you wanted in time to use the program,'' said Christine A. Flynn, president of Sonny Mae.\nIn addition, in place of the old system of ''income-ranking'' - a technique that gave buyers with the lowest incomes a better chance at the available money - the agency will now guarantee equal treatment to all qualified buyers. With so much more money available, income ranking was no longer necessary. SOMETIME this month, Sonny\nMae is also planning to announce new rates that should provide fixed-rate mortgages at slightly below 8 percent - almost 2 points lower than the prevailing rate for fixed-rate loans by conventional lenders.\nIt has also revamped its system of processing applications so that borrowers will be able to make telephone reservations through local banks for the amount being requested. And Ms. Flynn insists that a mortgage commitment from her agency should take no more than two weeks more than from a conventional lender.\nThe only drawback is the introduction of income limits, but they tend to be generous and should not affect too many borrowers. In the past, the agency's house-price limits tended to skew the applications towards moderate-income buyers anyway as a way to insure that the program's In the downstate section of New York State, the limit will be $48,500 per year for each borrower, with a borrower defined as the actual buyer of the property (if the home is being bought in the name of one spouse then only his or her income is counted towards the total).\nIncome limits fall slightly for upstate areas and rise marginally in specially targeted urban areas. For example, in parts of Mount Vernon and the outer boroughs of New York City, the limit rises to $53,000.\nCo-ops, condominiums and homes with up to four units are covered. On Long Island, the sales price limit is $113,670 for an existing house and $118,620 for a new house. In Westchester and New York City, it is $123,480 for an existing house and $116,460 for a new one. Allowable home prices rise slightly in the targeted areas.\nOnly first-time buyers are eligible except in the targeted areas. For further details, call (800) 382-HOME.\nConnecticut will be offering 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages at 7.8 percent with a payment schedule that allows it to be paid off in 17 years. This is done by adding 65 cents for each $1,000 of the outstanding amount to the monthly payments after two years, and a further 65 cents two years later throughout the life of the loan.\nIncome limits will be $38,000 for a household of three or fewer for Fairfield County buyers and slightly less for buyers in other areas of the state. Some funds will now also be set aside for prior owners. Home-price limits will be $130,000 in Fairfield County and $110,000 for most other areas, with the exception of specially targeted inner-city neighborhoods where they will be higher. For more details, call (203) 721-9501.\nThe New Jersey agency's fixed mortgage rate, currently 8.55 percent, is the least competitive, but a new bond issue expected in late February or March should lower it significantly.\nMr. Logue, the agency's executive director, said there should also be a relaxation of household income limits. To date, these have been $31,000 in the southern counties, with sales price limits of $130,000 in the north and $100,000 in the south.\nAgain, buyers in some 40 targeted areas need not comply with income limits nor necessarily be first-time buyers.

671	'THE COMPANY' AS BIG BUSINESS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDC1338F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: ON 15 flights early last year, the Southern Air Transport Company's big-bellied aircraft took 406 tons of cargo into El Salvador's Ilopango military airport, the principal transshipment point for Nicaraguan insurgents. Southern Air, a charter airline based in Miami, is a risk carrier, charging premium rates to fly to hot spots that large scheduled airlines will not go near.\nON 15 flights early last year, the Southern Air Transport Company's big-bellied aircraft took 406 tons of cargo into El Salvador's Ilopango military airport, the principal transshipment point for Nicaraguan insurgents. Southern Air, a charter airline based in Miami, is a risk carrier, charging premium rates to fly to hot spots that large scheduled airlines will not go near. ''We do spur of the moment, ad hoc work, anywhere,'' said William Kress, a spokesman for Southern Air. The company's role in supplying the Nicaraguan Contras might have remained secret but for an occupational hazard: On Oct. 5, a transport traced to Southern Air was shot down over Nicaragua - and the sole survivor, Eugene Hasenfus, quickly told interrogators that he thought his mission was backed by the Central Intelligence Agency.\nNow, as the Congress prepares to take a close look at the recent Iran guns-for-hostages affair, Southern Air's activities are coming under new scrutiny. For it was Southern Air that flew the American weapons to Israel, for shipment to Iran.\nBut Southern Air - which denies that it does work for the C.I.A. - is not the only company to get involved in covert foreign missions. While no one has taken a recent count of just how many companies are involved, it is well known in intelligence circles that ''the company,'' as the C.I.A. is nicknamed, uses all kinds of private-sector businesses to carry out its own business of gathering intelligence worldwide: transportation, export-import, construction and security-services companies, banks, public relations firms, and thousands of tiny companies that do not do much of anything - except provide cover for C.I.A. activities.\nMost companies that do work for the C.I.A. are mere shells, lightly capitalized ''paper'' companies set up for a quick arms purchase or an untraceable financial transfer, and then dissolved. But some are legitimate continuing operations, for which the C.I.A. links are just an incidental part of business. Many companies have a long history of C.I.A. ties: Southern Air was a wholly owned C.I.A. subsidiary not long ago. A few businesses, including an insurance complex, are still owned outright by the agency.\n''We get the impression that they have many, many thousands of such companies throughout the world,'' said Michael F. Barrett Jr., counsel for the House subcommittee on oversight and investigations. ''Setting them up is a routine matter.'' MOST experts say these companies - known as ''proprietaries,'' a term left over from an era when most were actual subsidiaries of the C.I.A., rather than simply contracting with the agency, as most do now - are a necessary tool for the agency. ''If you're going to have an intelligence service, you need proprietaries,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nOver the years, Washington policy makers have had intense disagreements about the implications of using private, profit-making companies in sensitive intelligence work. But the policy issue is only part of the problem. For the C.I.A. is a sort of shadow force in the private sector, a barely visible presence whose patronage can give certain favored companies a huge competitive advantage - and consign others to failure. (See box.) Most analysts agree that C.I.A. business is not a big factor in the national economy. ''My impression is that they were never large enough to have a significant impact,'' said Henry S. Rowen, a professor at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business and former chairman of the National Intelligence Council.\nBut it does cause ripples here and there. ''I'm sure they have a big impact on the Beltway,'' said Robert D. Hormats, a former senior economic official in four administrations, referring to the Washington ring road jammed with high-technology and consulting companies that serve the C.I.A. and other Government clients.\nSometimes the agency acts as a kind of wild card, affecting the economy in unforeseeable ways:\n* According to a former intelligence official, C.I.A. objections are among the reasons behind the present interagency review of the proposed sale of the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., to Japan's Fujitsu Company. Fairchild is among the suppliers of classified electronics gear for the C.I.A.'s Langley, Va., headquarters, a few miles inside the beltway. The agency is worried about diffusion of its secrets in Japan, the source said. Paul G. Hirsch, director of information systems for Fairchild, said he had no knowledge of this.\n* The C.I.A.'s casualty and life insurance complex was originally capitalized at $4 million in 1962, after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba spurred action to provide death and disability benefits for agents whose cover would be blown by participation in the C.I.A. or Civil Service retirement plans. By 1974, the complex had assets of more than $30 million, according to a 1976 Senate committee report and even by conservative estimates, the figure is now several times that. These assets are invested in offshore time deposits of American banks, long-term interest-bearing securities and common stocks.\n* Much of the money appropriated to the C.I.A. each year - the agency's budget is estimated at $2.5 billion to $3 billion - is deposited in banks here and abroad to cover operational needs. Since these accounts often maintain balances much larger than the amount needed to offset banking costs, they can be an important source of bank profits. The First National Bank of Chicago is among the banks named in government documents as holding C.I.A. accounts, but Anthony B. Zehnder, a bank spokesman said he could not confirm any relationship with the C.I.A.\n* Where companies connected with the C.I.A. compete with private enterprises, they may cause significant damage. One case that came to light involves the failure of at least 15 small, nonscheduled airlines in the 1960's following the C.I.A.'s purchase of Southern Air to conduct some of its risky business in Central and South America. The C.I.A. insisted that Southern Air bid on military transport contracts, to help maintain its cover as a civilian airline. Over three years, $250 million of military transport contracts went to verted to Southern Air and five other airlines that knew of its C.I.A. link.\nPrivate-sector businesses help the C.I.A. in many different ways. They provide the agency's Office of Logistics with many of its technological needs, from super computers to super bugging devicies. They purchase weapons, foreign armaments and technical devices; conduct security investigations; buy real estate; insure uninsurable risks; train foreign police forces, and run airlines in remote areas.\nAdm. Stansfield Turner, who directed the C.I.A. during the Carter years, said the proprietaries are needed to provide cover for C.I.A. operations: ''You run into some anomalous situations when you are trying to make people live in two environments at once. Little things like a paycheck and I.R.S. accounting can give away their second identify, and so you make changes in an innocent way to help them keep their cover.''\nBut mixing statecraft and profit can create real trouble.\n''The proprietaries have been one of the sources of the problems the agency has run into over the years,'' said Admiral Turner. There is always a risk, he said, that the businessmen brought into an operation will persuade intelligence agents to take actions that do more to increase profits than to help the operation, a phenomenon he referred to as ''the tail wagging the dog.''\nAnd in this case, the tail may be bigger than the dog. While exact figures are impossible to come by, most analysts say that the agency's outside activities probably involve more peoactivities probably involve more people than its internal activities.\nBy the last estimates, made in the 1970's at hearings of the Senate Select Committee to Study Intelligence Activities, the C.I.A.'s wholly owned companies employed 20,000 people -while the parent agency had only 18,000 employees. According to committee estimates, the agency had a gross annual income of $1.6 billion.\nThe Select Committee was established to investigate a series of abuses by the C.I.A. and its proprietaries, from infiltration of civil rights groups to interference with the Allende Government in Chile. Amid growing criticism - and with the end of the Vietnam War lessening the agency's transport needs subsidiaries - the C.I.A. sold off its free-wheeling airline proprietaries.\nAlthough the C.I.A. has fewer subsidiaries now, and contracts out most of its business to specialists with intelligence ties, analysts say outside businesses' role in agency projects has increased markedly under WilC.I.A. directors in decades. Some experts say there may be more people involved now than in the 1970's.\n''The agency uses fewer wholly owned subsidiaries and more private contractors, but the range of activities is little changed, and the volume of business could be 10 times higher than in our day,'' said L. Fletcher Prouty, a retired Air Force Colonel who ran many of the covert activities in the 1960's as chief of special operations with the joint chiefs of staff.\nAs a result of the furor over the sale of arms to Iran - and the ongoing debate about the exact roles played by the C.I.A., Manucher Chorbanifar, an Iranian arms dealer, and Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi financier - Congress may set new limits on the use of outside businessmen in C.I.A. actions.\n''Some people in the C.I.A. tend to forget they're still working for a Government entity that needs to follow certain rules and accountability,'' said Senator Leahy, adding that the intelligence panel would probably consider the problem next year. ''I know a lot of the proprietaries around the world,'' he said. ''I've talked to the people who run them. But now,'' after this Iran operation, ''I want more assurances that they're not handling things that we've agreed they can't do.''\nSouthern Air was not the only private company implicated in the Iran affair. Lake Resources Inc. - a Panamanian shell company set up in May 1985, about two months before the first shipments of weapons to Iran, and dissolved a week after the White House confirmed the sales -was far more typical of the sort of operation the C.I.A. uses.\nSuch shell companies maintain the fiction that they are going businesses by keeping bank accounts, generating business correspondence, retaining accounting records for audits, filing tax returns, and sometimes even obtaining bogus employee identification numbers. They usually have only $5,000 to $10,000 in capital, with a roster of taciturn lawyers as directors, officers and shareholders.\nLake Resources' most important asset was an account in the Swiss Credit Bank, where the profits from the weapons sale were deposited -an account controlled by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the National Security Council official who was dismissed when the White House disclosed that the profits had gone to the Contras. While most C.I.A. businesses are shells, some legitimate ongoing enterprises have also maintained C.I.A. connections for decades. Many of the companies sold off in the 1970's retained some ties to the agency.\nFor example, shortly after E-Systems Inc. bought Air Asia, a fomer C.I.A. airline, William F. Raborn, a former director of the C.I.A., joined the board of E-Systems, a Dallas-based comapny that makes electronic and aerospace systems. Although officials of E-Systems declined to discuss their relationship with the C.I.A., the company is widely thought to be a leading supplier of intelligence paraphernalia.\nThe C.I.A.'s connection with Southern Air, too, goes back for years. The C.I.A. bought Southern Air outright in 1960, paying $307,000 as part of an effort to beef up its air transport capacity. In 1973, the C.I.A. sold its airline to Stanley G. Williams, who ran the company for the agency, for $5.1 million - rejecting an unidentified buyer's offer of $2 million more.\nThe sale was financed by what was described in one affidavit as an ''unconventional loan'' from the First National Bank of Chicago, guaranteed by the C.I.A. In 1979 Mr. Williams sold it to the present sole owner, James H. Bastian, who was the carrier's lawyer during the C.I.A. years. Mr. Bastian had served on the board of Air America, once the agency's largest wholly owned company, with assets of $50 million. SOUTHERN Air's connections apparently have not hurt. The airline now has 25 planes and 540 employees, almost double that of a year ago, and its earnings -$907.000 in the third quarter of 1986, and $1.24 million in the second quarter - have risen sharply. United States Government business is only part of Southern Air's work. Over the last two years company logs show that it has been flying between Luanda and the diamond mining towns in northeast Angola under contract to Guernsey IAS, an Irish air cargo company. A senior State Department official said the department had learned that the airline was ferrying Cuban soldiers: ''We told them this was against American law, and they stopped it,'' he said.\nMr. Kress said he knew nothing about this activity. He also denies that Southern Air is part of a C.I.A. network. ''I'm tired of denying all the rumors that we're working for the C.I.A.,'' he said. Asked why the reports persist, he replied, ''I guess people really like spy stories.'' Mr. Kress stresses Southern Air's less splashy business, including an overnight air express package service, Burlington Air Express, out of Fort Wayne, Ind.\nNot all of the companies the C.I.A. uses are in such high-tech fields as electronics or airlines. Robert R. Mullen & Company - a well-known Washington public relations firm that has represented such clients as the American Bar Association, the American Automobile Association, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - provided slots for covert C.I.A. agents in Washington and in the firm's offices in Mexico City, Kuala Lumpur and the Hague, until the firm's cover was blown in 1973. E. Howard Hunt Jr., a C.I.A. operative convicted of conspiracy after the Watergate break-in, was at one time a writer in the Washington office.\nAnother firm that helped the agency in this way, according to Congressional sources, was Bishop, Baldwin, Rewald, Dillingham & Wong, a Honolulu investment firm that was involved in a securities fraud case. After the firm declared bankruptcy in July 1983, court documents showed that the C.I.A. had paid $2,700 of its phone bills. The C.I.A. acknowledged that it had a ''slight'' involvement.\nThree C.I.A. agents were among the investors who lost $22 million in the collapse: Jack Kindschi, a former head of the Honolulu office, J. Rardin, his successor, and R. Richardson, a covert agent. Despite these investments, which violated C.I.A. policy and earned reprimands for the agents, Congressional investigators concluded that Bishop Baldwin was used only as an address for covert agents and was not a C.I.A. money-laundering proprietary as Ronald R. Rewald, the firm's president, alleged.\nOther court records, from Australia, suggest that the C.I.A. was involved in international banking as part of its money-moving operations. Nugan Hand, a Sydney investment bank, was founded in 1973 by an Australian, Frank Nugan, and an American, Michael Hand.\nAfter it failed in 1980 Mr. Nugan was found shot dead and Mr. Hand vanished. A Sydney police report said Mr. Hand had business dealings in the late 1960's and early 1970's with the C.I.A.-controlled Air America and the C.I.A.-connected Continental Air Service, creating a ''strong inference that Hand's intelligence activity was with the C.I.A.'' It continued, ''There is some evidence to suggest that Hand retained his U.S. intelligence ties through the 1970's and into the 1980's.''\nThe bank - which astoundingly had increased its assets to $1 billion from $1 million in three years - employed a large number of retired American military and intelligence officers, and its legal adviser was former C.I.A. director William E. Colby. Mr. Colby's business card was the only thing found in Mr. Nugan's pockets when his body was discovered. The C.I.A. denied any involvement with the bank, but senior intelligence analysts here said that whether or not it had formal C.I.A. links, the company performed important financial services for the agency. VICTIMS OF A C.I.A. CONSPIRACY?\nIt was more than 20 years ago, but Ralph W. E. Cox Jr. says the memory of how his company was forced out of business still rankles.\nMr. Cox's company, U.S. Overseas Airlines, was one of 15 small airlines that failed in the early 1960's - victims, he says, of a conspiracy by the C.I.A., which had recently acquired Southern Air.\n''They wiped us out,'' said Mr. Cox, who now, at 71, manages a camping ground in Cape May, N.J., a few miles from the Cape May County Airport, which was home base for his carrier. ''We continued to try to operate. We couldn't conceive that our Government would do things like that. We were grounded Sept. 24, 1964, and forced into bankruptcy two years later. We didn't know until 10 years later what had really happened.''\nWhat happened, Mr. Cox and others say, is that $250 million of Military Air Transport contracts were diverted from their companies to Southern Air and five other airlines that learned of the secret link between C.I.A. and Southern Air and, in a quiet blackmail, demanded the military contracts as their price for keeping quiet about the connection.\nThe C.I.A. will not discuss it. ''We never discuss matters of this kind,'' said Sharon Foster, a C.I.A. spokesman. But the agency's role in the failure of the small airlines came to light in Government documents, obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests by Mr. Cox and others, and in 1976-77 testimony before the Senate Small Business Committee. The documents show a substantial diversion of military business in the early 1960's to Southern and five other carriers - most now defunct - alleged to be aware of Southern Air's C.I.A. connection. Mr. Cox, a World War II\nNavy pilot, says his company had revenues of $11.6 million in 1960, before the C.I.A. cut into his business. He and operators of the other failed airlines charge that the C.I.A. deprived them of their basic marketplace rights by conspiring with officials of the Government agencies that gave out the transport contracts, and with the airlines that knew the Southern Air secret.\nLed by Mr. Cox, Richard D. Neumann of the defunct California Air Charter Inc. and Amos Heacock, head of Air Transport Associates, another failed carrier, the former airline operators have spent years fighting for redress. They have filed suit in several Federal courts, claiming damages of $540 million. They have written formal letters of complaint to the C.I.A., and petitions to the Civil Aeronautics Board. But all of their claims have been rejected.\nWhile they still feel victimized, the owners of the failed airlines have given up the battle. ''It costs too damned much to fight the Government,'' said Mr. Neumann, who is now back in the aviation business in California. ''They can put 200 attorneys against you and tie you up for 10 years. We don't have those resources.''
672	A Steady Sales Pace in Manhattan	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB1338F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THE overbuilt market of new condominiums in Manhattan could possibly falter in mid-1987, but some of last year's dire predictions of a market collapse will be forgotten if interest rates remain low and sales continue at their smooth, steady pace, according to many market analysts.\nTHE overbuilt market of new condominiums in Manhattan could possibly falter in mid-1987, but some of last year's dire predictions of a market collapse will be forgotten if interest rates remain low and sales continue at their smooth, steady pace, according to many market analysts.\nSome of the doom forecasters are already eating their hats. ''I had expected the new construction market to be a total disaster now,'' said Neil J. Binder, a partner in Bellmarc Realty, an apartment brokerage that also manages new buildings. ''I'm not going to say that it's a steamroller, but the new construction market is not having any real problems - and, to me, that's very surprising.''\nOther analysts are still cautious. ''I believe the market cannot deal with the units that are out there, but I can't represent that the owners are having problems - they are keeping a stiff upper lip at this point,'' said Yale Robbins, who publishes statistical information about Manhattan condominium development and sales. He estimated that there are 25,000 condominium apartments, including several thousand renovation projects, now in construction or about to begin. If the market can absorb them, developers have proposed building an additional 25,000 apartments, including a large number of rentals.\nIn any event, the sharp decline in interest rates is largely credited with keeping both new and resale apartment markets on an even keel - at a time when Federal tax laws were changing, investors were deserting the marketplace and developers were marketing thousands of new units to take advantage of 10-year tax abatements under the Section 421a program, which expired for market-rate construction in most of Manhattan in late 1985.\nThe decline in rates, to the lowest level in eight years, made the apartments more affordable to buyers and, equally important, allowed developers to extend their sales period without incurring the sort of crippling credit expenses that force distress sales, concessions and bankruptcies.\nIn a parallel fashion, the resale market for existing cooperatives and condominiums in Manhattan has also picked up steam, brokers happily report. Prices for postwar apartments continued to be flat or slightly rising, but large prewar apartments in desirable locations have risen by as much as 10 to 15 percent, brokers said. Demand for larger apartments of any era is still stronger than demand for studios and one-bedroom apartments, but a few brokers, including Mr. Binder, asserted that small units have recovered from the sharp decline in value they experienced last summer.\nThe whole apartment market, then, was beginning to tighten, with sales activity increasing and prices beginning to advance tentatively in the last months of 1986.\nWhat's in store for the new year? ''An educated guess, based on what 1986 brought, would be that larger prewar co-ops will appreciate tremendously - maybe 10 to 15 percent - in 1987 because of the shortage of listings for anything larger than five and a half rooms,'' said Barbara Corcoran, president of the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage for resale co-ops and new condominiums. Smaller co-ops - studios to four-and-a-half-room apartments - will appreciate by about 8 percent, Mrs. Corcoran estimated.\nIn the market for new condominiums, she predicts, some prices will fall - not because of the poor market, but because developers overpriced their units from the start. ''It's a level market, not one that's going up,'' she said. ''Some developers overpaid on land and they needed to price units at a high level to make a profit - and some of them are nervous now.''\nThe Corcoran Group is marketing about 1,100 condominiums in 12 new buildings, including eight projects that will be announced this year. The emphasis, she said, will be on larger apartments. NEW condominium prices do not seem to be increasing marketwide - the average price per square foot has been hovering around $350 for a couple years -but marketing executives assert that prices have risen in many locations. For example, apartments at the Waterford, a 200-unit condominium at 93d and Second Avenue, sell for an average of $325 a square foot.\n''The price of this building is 15 percent higher than it would have been if we opened it a year ago,'' said James C. Stewart, president of Gilbert Charles Beylen, a Manhattan marketing concern. ''Prices are continually going up, not that developers are making more profit - land, construction and materials are constantly going up.''\nMr. Stewart, reflecting the view of nearly all developers and marketing agents interviewed, said sales are strong and steady. ''We are running somewhere around 12 percent behind our projections, which we made 18 months ago,'' he said. At this pace, he estimated that the company's 13 projects will sell out in an average of 12 months rather than 10 months, as originally projected. No concessions are offered or planned, he said.\nSome of the firm's projects are selling at a brisk pace. Marketing began at The Dunhill - the developer Arun Bhatia's 29-story condominium rising at 401 East 84th Street, at First Avenue - last October and half the 88 units have been sold. The America - the developer Ian Bruce Eichner's 36-story co-op going up at 300 East 85th Street, at Second Avenue - also began sales the same month and 30 percent of the 201 units have been sold. Apartments in both buildings average $350 a square foot.\n''Purchasers have been flooding in,'' said Robert W. Burnett, a vice president with M. J. Raynes. He was referring to the Corinthian, the 57-story condominium that has 863 units, the most of any residential building under construction. Raynes, which is marketing the property for Bernard Spitzer, the developer, said that 160 units, or more than $40 million worth of property, had been sold during the first five weeks of sales for occupancy scheduled next fall, and that the company was still screening 1,200 buyers who had signed up on a waiting list to see the apartment plans.\nThe building occupies the site of the former East Side Airlines Terminal, between 37th and 38th Streets off First Avenue. Its signature is a bay window with 180-degree views in every apartment. Prices average $350 a square foot.\nSome buildings have run into the kind of trouble that was expected to be more widespread at this point. Financing problems halted construction at 32-34 West 66th Street last summer and the problems with the 49-unit condominium have not been resolved.\n''We are now in the process of restructuring it,'' said Herbert Handman, the developer. ''We might be in a postion to continue shortly or it may take longer.'' He would not provide any details. Deposits were returned to some buyers, but others are hoping the project will be completed, he added. The building is about 85 percent complete, according to the builder. EVEN when the apartments themselves are small or mundane, developers are enhancing their buildings with bold exteriors by brand-name architects and knock-'em-dead lobbies. Italy, in fact, must be running low on marble, judging by its lavish use in this new crop of condominiums. Donald Trump's model for his lobby at Trump Parc at 106 Central Park South, for example, makes it look like a mausoleum - with floors, planters, walls and cornices of gold-streaked marble.\nTrump Parc apartments vary in price from less than $200,000 for the 65 studios to $7 million for a penthouse apartment. About 35 percent of the units have been bought since late October, said Blanche Sprague, executive vice president of the Trump Organization.\nIn the resale co-op market, the strong year-end activity was partly stimulated by the change in Federal tax laws. Sellers who were reaping capital gains - and not using all the profit to buy another prime residence -wanted their capital gains taxed under the more generous rule in effect until last Dec. 31.\n''The last month has been fantastic,'' said Betsy Dean, director of co-op sales at Douglas Elliman-Haldenstein on the West Side. ''I thought it must be the tax plan, but most of our deals are not closing in 1986 because there is too much of a backlog in building management offices.\n''You can't even get the managers on the telephone, they were going crazy trying to accommodate the buyers who wanted to close before the end of the year.''\nWhat has been making this market tick has been the decline in interest rates, according to most real-estate professionals. The bullish stock market and the enormous Christmas bonuses handed out on Wall Street also helped, they say.\nFor the buyer, the decline in mortgage interest rates - now less than 9 percent for conventional loans - seems to provide the bargain that was needed to dislodge psychological and financial resistance to today's prices. The monthly carrying cost of a $250,000 conventional mortgage, for example, is now around $2,000, compared with $2,500 at average 1985 prices (in March 1985, such a loan would have cost $2,800 a month).\nFor developers, the decline in rates is doubly sweet. Not only does the reduced cost of credit prompt more apartment sales, but it also allows developers to extend sales periods without sacrificing profit or risking bankruptcy. The extra sales time is available because lenders financed construction of this wave of condominium projects in 1985 - before rates started to decline by 25 percent, according to Richard R. Pergolis, a partner with Pergolis-Swartz, a Manhattan mortgage brokerage.\nIn a typical condominium project, a lender will write a construction loan to cover 80 to 100 percent of the total development cost and to finance an ''interest reserve account.'' This reserve, or debt-service account, supplies the lender with interest payments during the 24-month duration of the loan. For additional steep fees, the lender will usually extend the loan for up to one more year.\nThe interest rate on these variable-rate loans generally floats 1.5 to 2 percentage points over the prime rate - but the debt-service account is financed on the expectation that rates will be stable for two years.\nIf the prime rate increases, then the reserve account will be used up more quickly, and either the lender will increase the loan or require the developer to pay the extra interest costs. But if the prime rate falls, as it did, the reserve account is drawn down more slowly and the developer has more time to sell apartments.\n''Instead of having to build and sell their units within 24 months, developers now have around 30 months to sell without having to put up any more of their own money into the project,'' said Andrew J. Singer, who said his brokerage firm, Ackman Brothers & Singer, arranged financing for about 1,000 of the apartments in the marketplace.\nIf rates had remained at their higher level, many developers would probably have been getting nervous - and offering discounts and concessions - now because their loans would be coming due in the summer. The decline in rates, however, has granted developers a reprieve, possibly until next fall or winter if rates remain stable.\nWilliam C. McCahill, a vice president in charge of Chase Manhattan Bank's construction lending in the area, confirmed this market view. ''Most of our buildings are in pretty good shape, given the sales in the presale period before completion and the savings in the interest reserve accounts,'' he said. ''I am not saying everyone will be in good shape, but most will.''\nChase financed about 2,000 of the units on the market and about half have already been sold, Mr. McCahill estimated. But he said two of the bank's 15 condominium projects were already offering below-market financing to buyers. He would not identify the buildings -since concessions are usually associated with failing projects or undesirable apartments, lenders and developers do not like to publicize them.\nAnother 2,000 units financed by Chase will come on the market this year, Mr. McCahill said. ''I don't see prices going up in the next nine to 12 months,'' he concluded, ''but as supply in the market begins to dwindle, it will put pressure on prices again. And with the relative dearth of new jobs scheduled for 1988 and 1989, that trend should continue.''\nRic Katz, president of RAMS Marketing, a Manhatan firm that creates marketing strategies for new buildings, forecast that concessions would start appearing as early as next summer at buildings that were not properly marketed, designed, financed or situated.\n''Some buildings will only be 50 percent or 40 percent sold out and developers will start trying to stimulate sales through incentives or giveaways,'' he said. ''But this won't happen at the prime locations or where apartments are being marketed correctly.\n''My instincts tell me that there are developers out there right now giving some concessions - paying the closing costs or giving decorating allowances - but I can't cite examples.''\nBuildings that RAMS is marketing include 100 United Nations Plaza, where Mr. Katz said 87 percent of the 271 units had been sold.\nOnly one major building, Astor Terrace at 245 East 93d Street, has placed full-page advertisements for its generous concession: conventional financing at the below-market rate of 8 percent. The apartments are well-designed, but some brokers say the prices are high for its location. One-bedroom apartments start at $200,000.\nJean Soloman, one of the building's developers, said the financing was a temporary inducement to keep ''our excellent momentum going through the holiday season.'' Mrs. Soloman said the building was close to 85 percent sold. She would provide no information on the terms of construction financing. THERE is no way to independently verify sales, a term that includes binding sales contracts as well as recorded closings. Yale Robbins, whose research firm publishes data on Manhattan sales, reported that as of Nov. 15, 48 percent of the units at Astor Terrace had closed and an additional 15 percent were under contract, a combined total of 63 percent sold. The estimates are based on interviews with developers, marketing agents and other sources familar with projects, as well as data on recorded sales. According to Mr. Robbins, it is not uncommon for sellers to overstate their sales.\nThere have been no recorded sales at Metropolitan Tower, the 78-story condominium with 239 units going up at 146 West 57th Street, but here again, the developer's figures and Yale Robbins' are far apart. Julie Simpson, a spokeman for Harry Macklowe Real Estate Company, the developer, said about 50 percent of the units were sold. Mr. Robbins, however, asserted that only 25 percent of the units were sold as of last July 15 and that this percentage had not increased as of Nov. 15.\n''They may represent that they sold 50 percent,'' Mr. Robbins said, ''but we believe that the number was 25 percent, based on our conversations with people directly and indirectly involved with the project.''\nPrices at Metropolitan Tower, which is nearing completion, have been increased four times and now average $550 a square foot - a price that reflects the building's high level of service and park views. Some brokers, though, consider the property overpriced for the 57th Street location.

The merger wave is continuing to roil key industries. Slow, or non-existent, growth and falling prices are forcing some sectors into a new pragmatism.\nIn oil, commercial real estate and agriculture, owners are becoming more willing to sell out at what seem to be fire-sale prices.

The answer will begin to unfold in 1987, as three neophyte media managers make decisions that affect what Americans will be watching -or not watching - on TV.\nAt NBC, the air is thick with uncertainty and tension. Robert Wright, the former head of General Electric Credit, installed as NBC's new chief after G.E. took over the network last year, does not seem to be going over well with his new employees. A poem making the rounds at 30 Rockefeller Center, network headquarters, even shows a craving for poor ratings to shake up what is viewed as hostile new management: So this Xmas season, as you search for yule cheer, Pray for an upset in ratings next year, Though the old days were clouded by viewer neglect, 30 Rock was a family, and we had self respect.\nThere is also turmoil at the top of CBS, currently controlled by Laurence A. Tisch, the chairman of the Loews Corporation, and at ABC, headed by Thomas Murphy of Capital Cities Communications. If these men can narrow the cultural gap between their executive offices and the networks' creative people, their money-making skills will be welcome.\nBoth CBS and ABC have been under increasing financial strain. Their advertising revenues are under double pressure: They both trail NBC in the Nielsen ratings, and they trail in an era when advertiser spending on television has slowed. Costs must be cut - and much of the cutting may be on the once-sacrosanct news side, which under traditional management had been treated as a public trust. Another big question for 1987 is whether that trust might be one of the first victims of the new regimes.\nHOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987

The nation's largest steel company is undergoing the longest work stoppage in industry history. So far, the protracted shutdown, which began last August, has idled 22,000 workers and halted production.\nAs it removes one-fifth of the industry's steelmaking capacity, the stoppage has also given fresh hope to USX's major competitors - namely, the embattled Bethlehem Steel and the bankrupt LTV. As they absorb the orders traditionally placed with USX, they are reporting modest improvements in shipment levels and pricing.\nNow these and other rivals are worried about the return of the giant steelmaker's capacity. An end to the work stoppage, they say, will bludgeon an already depressed industry.\nAnd most steel company executives say the end is in sight: They do not expect the five-month-old shutdown to last much beyond the first quarter. USX has already lost orders placed for delivery in the first quarter, they say, and the company will want to salvage orders for delivery in the second quarter. And, they point out, most workers' unemployment benefits are beginning to run out.\nOnce the shutdown ends, many analysts say, USX will mount a vigorous effort to seize back market share and customer loyalty. The company, they predict, will slash prices dramatically and undercut other producers.\nAnalysts also say, however, that when USX resumes production, it will be at a level far below its pre-shutdown rate. USX chairman David M. Roderick has said that it is unclear whether the company will reopen all of its plants when the work stoppage ends. The market situation for each product line, he says, will dictate what facilities will reopen.\nHOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987

That, however, is what is being offered in the Enclave, a new development in one of the borough's oldest and most exclusive neighborhoods.\nWhen finished in the summer of 1988, its 11 custom-built houses will stud Howard Circle, a private road entered through a gate off Howard Avenue in the Grymes Hill section. In pre-negotiated agreements based on plans, three buyers have committed between $1.1 million and $1.4 million for homes. Each detached house must be a minimum of 4,500 square feet.\nThere are views of the Manhattan skyline and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge from the back of the development. ''If you want a large, luxury home with an amazing view of Manhattan, this is it,'' said John Noce, a principal in Princewood Development Group, a builder and developer on Staten Island, which is doing the project. Buyers work with the architect, Calvanico Associates of Staten Island, to determine the exact style of each two-story house. Only stucco, stone or brick siding will be permitted, and the backs of the homes will be made primarily of glass to afford the best views of New York Harbor.\nMr. Noce, who is in partnership with his brother, Joseph, and Emanuel Bolitiere, said a typical house would measure 5,500 square feet and would include four to five bedrooms, four bathrooms, a study, a library, a recreation room and a three-car garage.\nThe only thing not terribly gargantuan about the development is the size of the parcels, which range from one-quarter to three-quarters of an acre. The entire site originally covered eight acres, but the developer donated three and a half acres to an environmental group.

The tough procurement procedures adopted in 1986 by the Pentagon are forcing the major aerospace companies to spend billions on upfront development costs - money that once was supplied largely by Government.\nCompanies are incurring the costs just to compete for big contracts, with no assurance of a payoff in the long run. Because potential profits are vast, no major company has decided against taking the risk.\nThe battle to build the Advanced Tactical Fighter, the next generation of Air Force fighter planes, is a case in point. Upfront costs are expected to be in the billions, but the contract itself could amount to $50 billion. The winner will be chosen in 1990.\nTo spread the risk, aerospace and military-related companies have broken into teams. The finalists are a group including Northrop and McDonnell Douglas on one hand and Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics on the other.\nSimilar competitions are being waged over the Navy's new Advanced Tactical Aircraft strike plane and the Army's LHX helicopter.\nThe new pay-upfront system is being hailed by the armed services as a more efficient way of spending the taxpayers' money. But critics say the plan could encourage contractors to take money-saving shortcuts in the development stage that could lead ultimately to less effective aircraft.

And that is, Will the buildings survive in the long run as decent rental housing, or will future inflation or a market downturn lead to a new wave of abandonment?\nIn part, the answer turns on circumstances that cannot be foretold - the rate of inflation, the adequacy of stabilized rent increases, the state of the city's economy and of the rental market generally. But it also turns on how the programs are set up initially. And there is no doubt that the leadership of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development - notably Commissioner Paul A. Crotty and his deputy commissioner for development, Mark Willis - are aware of the potential pitfalls as well as the opportunities, and have tried to take them into consideration in planning the program.\nThe city owns about 5,500 vacant tax-foreclosed buildings and they are believed to contain 55,000 to 60,000 apartments. The plan announced last month applies to about 10 percent of the apartments in that stock - 5,200 units - and 5 percent of the buildings.\nMost of these apartments - 3,400 in 211 buildings, grouped into 53 development sites - are to be awarded through a request-for-proposals bidding process. The city intends to develop the remaining 1,800 apartments in 59 buildings itself through the use of construction management companies.\nThe requests for proposals will go out tomorrow and will be due back in phases - roughly a third in February, a third in June and a third in August. In the review, housing officials are trying to accomplish many steps simultaneously rather than sequentially as in the past. They expect construction in the first phase to begin by next January, a schedule that officials feel is as rapid as can be achieved.\nPreparations are also under way to put out an additional 1,000 units for construction by nonprofit developers only, with financing possibly obtained through such entities as the Local Initiative Support Corporation, known as LISC, a national operation established by foundations and major corporations to assist neighborhood economic development and housing for lower-income people. One problem is how to get the job done with efficiency at reasonable cost, a difficult proposition for nonprofit companies if they have little previous experience or none of their own capital at stake.\nAs administered by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development over the last several years, the request-for-proposal process has not acquired a reputation for producing results. In many cases, local wrangling over who should be chosen to do what work has led to delaying awards for months, or making none at all for no publicly disclosed reason, leaving bidders disillusioned with the process and the agency. THAT experience led the Citizen Housing and Planning Council, a housing advisory organization, to propose a different method of project award for the vacant tax-foreclosed buildings, based on the notion that it is a futile exercise to focus selection on a ''competitive variable'' since the costs of gut rehabilitation are well known and essentially the same for all.\nIt called the request-for-proposal procedure ''the politically most acceptable approach,'' but one that wastes time and money once the city has decided how its property should be used. The chairman of the Citizen Housing and Planning Council panel that issued the report was Sander Lehrer, a former city Housing Commissioner.\nThe council proposed that the city issue a detailed ''scope of work'' detailing to builders what it wants for the housing and how soon it wants it, and then make its selections from a pool of prequalified builders on a site-specific or random basis. ''Only if the R.F.P. process becomes predictable, timely and realistic,'' the committee said, ''will rehabilitation of large numbers of city-owned propoerties become possible.''\nBut the Department of Housing Preservation and Development decided it could not proceed without a competitive bidding process. The agency will offer the buildings at $1 each, and essentially tell bidders how much subsidy is available for each development ''package'' - with up to 250 apartments per package. They will be given proposed layouts and told the minimum number of low-income units that must be provided. Selection preference will go to the developer that can provide the greater number of low-income units - that is, build for a cheaper cost, or possibly build in lower operating costs.\nThe bidder will have 90 days to win private construction financing, Commissioner Willis said, and if it fails, the selection will go to the next most favorable bid. Since bank financing is needed, bids will have to be ''realistic.''\nBank financing, in fact, is critical to the entire endeavor. City officials have been careful to carry on a dialogue with Michael D. Lappin, president of the New York City Community Preservation Corporation, a consortium of commercial and savings banks that has provided construction and permanent financing to more rental rehabilitation projects in the city that any other lender.\nIts borrowers - typically owners of medium-sized rental property -are expected to be prominent among the bidders for the gut rehabilitations of city-owned buildings. The corporation also has been the city's lending partner in many ''participation'' loans, in which the city provides roughly half the financing at 1 percent interest.\nIn the Section 236 program, the entire insured mortgage was financed at 1 percent, and it was intended to cover 95 percent of the development cost. Many builders are believed to have been able to cover 100 percent of their costs or more. IF rents could not support costs over time, the builder - having made substantial profits in the early development stages - would soon default and H.U.D. would find itself in possession of the property.\nIn the city's program, the 1 percent financing will apply to about two-thirds of the development cost. In a typical situation, the development cost in a gut rehabilitation of a 50-unit building might be $60,000 an apartment. The builder would put in $6,000, the city would finance $40,000 of the cost at 1 percent, and the private lender would finance the rest, $14,000 a unit, or 23 percent of the total.\nMaximum initial rents for moderate-income households would not exceed $450 a month for a studio, $600 for a one-bedroom, $700 for a two-bedroom and $800 for a three-bedroom. The average moderate-income rent will be $575 a month. Initial rents for low-income families would be capped for two-bedroom apartments at $350.\nThe private lender will be at risk in the construction and permanent financing, and can be expected to insist that rents be higher than the market within the area would support. In this way, builders and their lenders can be more confident that in the event of vacancy, they can rerent at a level that the project requires. ''The market rent and the allowable rent must be consistent,'' Mr. Lappin said.\nIn the Section 236 program, tenants came in paying 30 percent of their income as rent, said Alexander Naclerio, former director of housing in the regional office of the Federal Housing Administration, and it was assumed that their incomes would rise as rent requirements increased. That did not happen during the inflationary 1970's; the government refused to allow rents to rise to levels many tenants would have found unaffordable, and builders defaulted. Much property fell back into Federal hands. IN the city program, normal rent-stabilized increases are expected to compensate for rising operating costs. In addition, private lenders are likely to require that owners be able to rent to tenants with incomes above the program's limits if, after a certain reasonable time period, they cannot find enough tenants incomes below them.\n''There must be enough flexibility built into the income limits and the rent limits to permit the project to pay for increases in costs over time,'' said Mr. Lehrer, the former housing commissioner.\nAccording to Mr. Lappin, the actual costs of gut rehabilitations are known from experience. Opportunities for quick profit are not ''built into the program,'' he said, and builders will want to operate their properties over time.\nThe vacant buildings in the first three phases are primarily being given at zero cost and will pay zero property taxes. The annual mortgage-interest subsidy comes to about $4,000 a year per family on a 1 percent loan of $43,000.\nThe requests for proposals will be of two types, Commissioner Willis said. Some will ask for 20 percent low-income units, based on the principle that the buildings will be capable of generating enough income from the rest of the apartments to subsidize the rents of the low-income units. Other buildings are in locations where they cannot be expected to generate enough rental income for subsidizing lower-income tenants.\nThe market areas are not considered strong enough to permit ''cross-subsidies,'' in which market-rate gut rehabilitations can achieve such high figures in rents or sales that builders can afford to subsidize lower-income buildings in the vicinity. This principle has been applied to the disposal of city-owned buildings in Williamsburg, in Brooklyn, and on the Lower East Side.\nPERSPECTIVES: GUT REHABILITATIONS

Banks in Florida, Texas, Colorado and New York have suffered huge losses on construction lending and permanent financing. To stem the drain on earnings caused by empty buildings, they will be eager to unload shopping centers, condominiums and office buildings at steep discounts from the values placed on the properties at the time they first made the loans.\nJoining them in aggressive selling will be the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, both of them stuck with bulging portfolios of unprofitable real estate.\nDevelopers, farmers and investors who held on through a sluggish market for the past year or so, hoping for improvement, will finally quit when the economy fails to pick up speed.\nAmong the best deals will be hotels, unoccupied condominiums and office buildings, and historic properties renovated under advantageous tax rules that no longer apply.\nBut anyone who wades in will have to exhibit a great deal of staying power. Gone are the days when inflation and growth in the office work force would automatically bring good times after bad, and anyone carrying heavy debt loads will be a candidate for liquidation before the next peak.\nThe buyers who will gobble up the bargains, paying half what developers were asking in early 1986, will be those who who are not already weighed down with heavy debt -America's real estate tycoons. The tycoons (and the life insurance companies and pension funds that follow them) will be looking for cash returns, not for the kind of tax breaks that made so many real estate deals appeal to small investors in the last decade. Those breaks have been eliminated by the tax law that took effect on Jan. 1.\nIn some specific markets - primarily New York, California and Washington, D.C. - foreign investors, particularly Japanese and Hong Kong-based Chinese, will supply staggering amounts of capital, driving up prices in fits and starts as they struggle to learn the local business. But these buyers will test the market outside the major cities only tentatively, having little impact on prices nationwide.\nHOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987

The merger wave is continuing to roil key industries. Slow, or non-existent, growth and falling prices are forcing some sectors into a new pragmatism.\nIn oil, commercial real estate and agriculture, owners are becoming more willing to sell out at what seem to be fire-sale prices. In entertainment, hard-nosed business executives are cutting costs.\nWith all this, short-term interest rates are likely to dip even further as the Federal Reserve pours money into an economy limping into its fifth expansionary year.\nWhat follows is a look at what could prove to be some of the more interesting sectors by business and economic correspondents of The New York Times.\nFOR Wall Street, 1987 could prove a particularly tough year as investment bankers grapple with the consequences of takeover mania and of their headlong rush into the international arena.\nJust about every major investment bank has grown top-heavy with merger specialists in recent years as they have fought to pull in more of this lucrative business. It has also meant, though, that they must generate a continuing flow of transactions to support the overhead. Increasingly, they are doing this by agreeing to finance transactions with their own capital - to become merchant bankers. In one deal this fall, First Boston lent the Campeau Corporation $865 million for its $3.5 billion takeover of Allied Stores. Yet First Boston's total capital amounted to only about $1.3 billion at the end of September.\nThus, investment firms will be tying up a significant portion of capital - capital they used to regard as a safety cushion - in huge and potentially risky loans. Should one of those loans sour, a major firm could be sunk, or crippled. Should the whole takeover business slow, the huge profits earned in the past five years could be sucked into an abyss.\nWall Street firms will also be trying to figure out just how much of an international presence they need. Most firms have spent fortunes to build large operations in London, Tokyo and elsewhere to take advantage of the increasingly international flow of capital. But the trend has been driven by competition, not profits. So much has been spent on building that few if any major firms have brought home any dividends. Instead, their aim has been to buy market share, foregoing profits today in the hope of gains in the future when lesser competitors are driven out.\nThe problem is that major foreign financial institutions and American commercial banks have far more capital, and thus staying power, than some major investment banks.\nWall Street firms have held their own so far, but if the long-awaited international shakeout does come to pass in 1987, some top firms will have to stand prepared to lay off hundreds of people overseas, write off some of their investment, and give up their international pretensions.\nHOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987
683	Helping the Elderly Keep Their Homes	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDA1338F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: IN an effort to help elderly homeowners trying to hold on to their houses, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority will begin offering low-interest loans to finance the construction of accessory apartments later this month.\nIN an effort to help elderly homeowners trying to hold on to their houses, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority will begin offering low-interest loans to finance the construction of accessory apartments later this month.\nCarol A. Montesi, a spokesman for the authority, said funds for the program would come out of the agency's surplus assets, which consist of monies paid back on other authority loans.\n''We're confident we can meet the demand,'' Ms. Montesi said. ''We will provide the necessary resources.''\nThe program, to be called Apartment Conversions for the Elderly, will be open to homeowners 62 or older and will provide as much as $80,000 in 30-year fixed-rate financing with interest rates as low as 7 percent, Ms. Montesi said.\nThe accessory apartment must be within a single-family owner-occupied house, with its own bath, kitchen, living and sleeping areas, she said.\n''What we're attempting to do,'' Ms. Montesi said, ''is provide an option for people of limited income who want to continue living in their own homes but who need to supplement their income.''\nAccording to figures from the State Housing Department, about 400 accessory apartments have been created each year since 1982, when it started keeping records.\nThe apartments are most popular in urban areas, according to the Housing Department. Last year, 51 accessory apartments were approved by building permit in New Haven, 48 in Danbury, 39 in Bridgeport, 37 in Stamford, 28 in Greenwich and 16 in Hartford.\nIn Stamford, however, a recent residents' initiative voted down the ordinance allowing accessory apartments, said Richard S. Eigen, staff assistant for the Housing Task Force for Fairfield County 2000.\n''I was surprised when we first heard about it,'' he said. ''But my experience people who live in areas of very small lots often oppose accessory apartments.\n''A lot of people think this is going to lead to four or five cars in each yard and more traffic ln local streets,'' Mr. Eigen said. ''A lot of people are afraid of that overcrowding.''\nHe added, however, that low-interest financing for accessory apartments will be a good program for other southwest Connecticut communities that allow them, because of the severe housing shortage in that area.\n''The committee is looking at a number of directions we should take to ease the housing shortage,'' he said, ''and accessory apartments are one area you always look at.''\nHousing and planning officials say there are many more accessory apartments not reported in the state housing statistics because of zoning that prohibits accessory apartments or excessively restricts them.\nDuncan M. Graham, director of the Central Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said a recent study of 47 communities in western Connecticut showed that only 16 allowed accessory apartments, and that of those, most impose restrictions that severely limited who could construct them. WHERE there are restrictions, Mr. Graham said, illegal development of accessory apartments is encouraged.\n''It's too bad there have to be so many restrictions,'' he added, ''because from a planning standpoint, accessory apartments are a good way to create affordable rentals in towns where rental apartments might be scarce, and help homeowners reduce the cost of ownership.''\nMarguerite P. Reich, director of the Windham Regional Planning Agency, said that in recent years, several towns in that area have adopted ordinances that allow accessory apartments of one type of another.\n''More and more towns are starting to specifically address the issue,'' she said, ''as more and more people come before them asking to create accessory apartments.''\nMs. Montesi said the authority hoped that the new program would spur more communities to relax their regulations regarding accessory apartments. ''Our role is to stimulate the housing market, but our role is somewhat limited,'' she said.\nMs. Montesi added, ''We're not going to take an advocacy role in this, we're not going to encourage towns to change the zoning the regulations to allow for these conversions.''\nMs. Montesi said the loans for accessory apartments must be first mortgages, although some of the funds can be used to pay off existing first mortgages and loan-origination expenses.\nIt can be used to build an apartment within the house or in an addition, she said, and the apartment can be either for a tenant or for the elderly homeowner to occupy himself and free the rest of the house for rental.\nThose whose incomes are below the authority's limits, with maximums that range from $25,800 to $33,000 depending on the location of the house, qualify for 7 percent financing. Others still quality for the program, but at an 11 percent rate.\n''We're trying to make the program as flexible as we can,'' Ms. Montesi said.\nShe said the program is the second operated by the authority geared solely to elderly people. Two years ago, the authority began writing reverse annuity mortgages of as much as $100,000, which provides elderly people with a regular income. That mortgage is paid if the house is sold.\nOf the 230 mortgages totaling $12 million disbursed so far under that program, the average recipient is 74 years old with an income of $10,200, Ms. Montesi said. The average house in that program is valued at $119,000, and the average mortgage is $70,000, she said.

While one might wonder what 30 percent of 2,000 companies would say in 1986, a review of the classifieds in the Sunday New York Times on Nov. 9 illustrated that descriptors such as ''attractive,'' ''bright and perky,'' and ''modeling a plus'' are still included in ads for pink collar fields such as receptionist and administrative titles. Descriptors for male-dominated fields, such as messenger, are primarily job performance related rather than subjective.\nThe perception of pink collar jobs in sexual rather than functional terms is apparent in such ads as ''Word Processor With a Brain.'' The majority of word processors are female; the classified ad reflects a recruitment effort for other than the perceived norm.\nWere I to compose a classified ad for ''messenger'' in the tone used for pink collar occupations, I might say something like ''Clean-shaven, fresh-smelling, polite, energetic champ with good leg muscles, and a winning smile.''

685	Church's Housing Plan Unsettles the East Village	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D91338F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THE parishioners at St. George's Ukrainian Catholic Church dazzled the East Village a decade ago with a new house of worship whose gold domes and decorative paintings befitted its Byzantine heritage. But now the church wants to build again, and people in the neighborhood want it to stop.\nTHE parishioners at St. George's Ukrainian Catholic Church dazzled the East Village a decade ago with a new house of worship whose gold domes and decorative paintings befitted its Byzantine heritage. But now the church wants to build again, and people in the neighborhood want it to stop.\nThe proposed building, a 16-story structure with church facilities on the first four floors and 96 cooperative units above, is intended to help house Ukrainian parishioners who have recently come back to the area.\n''I am responsible for the welfare of my community,'' said the Rev. Patrick Paschak, ''not only spiritually, but socially. We've always had this area as a center of our activities. We're trying to restore our community life, and housing is a key need.''\nThe 85,000-square-foot tower would rise next door to the church, which is at 33 East Seventh Street between Second and Third Avenues, on a site that is now used as a church parking lot. A three-story convent owned by St. George's nextto the lot would be torn down for added space.\nBut the co-op building would exceed in size what is permitted under the zoning law by 58,000 square feet. The church has applied to the Board of Standards and Appeals for six variances affecting light, air, distances between buildings and bulk, among other things. A hearing date has not been set yet.\nOpponents of the building - mostly members of Community Board 3, which rejected the plan in September, and the Sixth and Seventh Streets Block Association - say it is not only the size that would overwhelm the block, now composed mostly of four- to six-story tenements. The prices are too high, they contend, the admissions policy discriminatory and the precedent, in terms of future development, is a dangerous one.\n''We do think they have a right to build, but we want to keep this from becoming another high-rent, high-rise neighborhood,'' said Carol Joyce, president of the block association. ''There are a lot of people on fixed incomes who are really terrified. We want to prevent what we see as an inevitable snowballing of developers.''\nThe issue of discrimination may prove the thorniest of all for the church. The co-ops are to be built for parishioners only. However, a city administrative code forbids all forms of discrimination in housing, which would include exclusive occupancy based on creed or national origin - the two kinds most likely to apply in this instance.\nPlanned are 36 studios averaging 450 square feet, 36 one-bedrooms with about 700 square feet and 24 two-bedrooms with 950 feet. They are expected to cost between $100,000 to $250,000. The architect is Philip P. Agusta & Associates of Forest Hills, Queens.\nFather Paschak said the money generated from the sales of the co-ops would pay for the church facilities, which include a rectory, community room, apartments for nuns and priests, administrative offices, a chapel, a library and quarters for the pastor.\n''They keep saying they have saved the neighborhood,'' said Miriam Friedlander, a councilwoman for lower Manhattan, referring to the parishioners. ''Well, building an expensive group of co-ops for a particular group is not saving the community. That's not the spirit we want here.''\nPartly to placate the community but also to provide cheaper housing for poor or elderly Ukrainian parishioners, St. George's has said it will renovate two tenements that it owns across the street into 20 low-income rental units.\nThose buildings, at 27 and 33 East Seventh Street, are now used for priests' apartments and offices, but would be vacated once the new building opens. THERE are about 25,000 Ukrainians living in the area, which stretches roughly between Third Avenue and Avenue A and 14th and Houston Streets, according to Father Paschak. At one time, there were many more.\nIn the late 1940's and early 1950's, thousands left their homeland because of political and religious oppression under the Soviet government. In the United States they established communities in such cities as Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Rochester, N.Y., Hartford and New York, joining an earlier wave of Ukrainians that had emigrated around 1912.\n''Even though they were professional people, the Ukrainian immigrants had to take menial work,'' Father Paschak explained. ''But when their children grew up and got education and better jobs, they moved to Queens, Long Island and New Jersey, while the parents stayed. Now the children want to come back.''\nThose ''children,'' most of them now parents themselves, have slowly been reclaiming their roots. The young parents, Father Paschak said, are forming closer ties with East Seventh Street, the main artery of the Ukrainian community. They attend the church and send their children to the two Ukrainian schools right behind St. George's on East Sixth Street, he said.\n''Ten years ago, housing in this area was rundown and terrible,'' said Dr. Maria Chaban, a 38-year-old physician who recently moved to the East Village from Forest Hills, Queens, with her husband, Bohdan, an engineer, and their three children. ''But a lot of us would now like to continue the tradition by moving back.\n''There is so much in this community for the children - Ukrainian schools and theater, folk music and dancing,'' Dr. Chaban continued, standing outside the church after a Saturday evening service. ''It's important to me that my children are bilingual. The culture adds depth and flavor to their lives.''\nBut some see this as an attempt to foster exclusivity. ''They're attempting to pit their people against others,'' said Ms. Friedlander, the councilwoman.\nThe housing discrimination code contains an exemption for religious institutions. But according to Joan M. Thompson, director of the Fair Housing Division of the New York City Commission on Human Rights, it does not pertain to the proposed co-op.\n''The exemption speaks to educational purposes,'' Ms. Thompson said. ''For example, if a temple wanted to build units to house rabinnical students, that would be acceptable. But this building would be in conflict with the city's human rights law.''\nDefending the conventionally financed $10 million project, Father Paschak said, ''If we were using funds from the city, we would have to open it up. But this is like building a home for your family.'' Further, anyone can join the parish, regardless of nationality, he said.\nAll the services at the Catholic church are conducted in Ukrainian, however.
686	Island Park	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D91338F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: MICHAEL PARENTE and his family first vacationed in the tiny seashore community of Island Park in the summer of 1953 for a brief respite from the sweltering streets of Brooklyn. The vacation never ended.\nMICHAEL PARENTE and his family first vacationed in the tiny seashore community of Island Park in the summer of 1953 for a brief respite from the sweltering streets of Brooklyn. The vacation never ended.\n''We liked Island Park so much, we moved right from our summer bungalow into a new home,'' said Mr. Parente, now the mayor of the Nassau County village. ''And we never went back to Brooklyn.'' What was once a summer haven for people like the Parentes is now home to 10,000 residents of the village and the neighborhoods of Barnum Island and Harbor Isle. All share the same school district and post office and are considered part of the Island Park community. But Barnum Island and Harbor Isle residents only pay taxes to the Town of Hempstead.\nResidents of Island Park, a good number of whom know each other by name, say the village blooms in the summer, when its small beaches are open and children fish in the many canals.\nThe island climate is one reason people settle in the South Shore village, where southwest winds keep it cool in the summer and warmer than inland in the winter. It probably also attracted the Rockaway Indian tribe, which once hunted and gathered shellfish there.\nReal-estate brokers say a mix of affordable housing and exclusive waterfront homes are major attractions of the community, which is bordered on the north by Oceanside and in the south by Long Beach (to the east and west, channels and marshland stretch away to Cedarhurst and Jones Beach, respectively).\nIn the heart of the less-than-a-square-mile village, some of the three-bedroom, bungalow-like homes, which date from the 1930's, cost $100,000 to $125,000, said Henry Hastava, owner of Hastava Real Estate. Three-bedroom ranches with water views sell for about $150,000.\nA Long Island Lighting Company plant that straddles the border of Oceanside and Island Park is a prime ratable and helps keep the property-tax rate low; a tiny three-bedroom house that sold recently for $119,000, for example, pays taxes of $1,000 a year.\nThe cost of housing is slightly higher in Harbor Isle and Barnum Island, where the homes are newer and larger. Development started in both areas in the early 1950's.\nHouses that face canals on Island Park - a mix of split-levels, colonials and contemporary cedar - cost $300,000 to $350,000 and those on the bayfront sell for $400,000, according to Roberta Scully, owner of Scully Realty, a local brokerage. Summertime activity revolves around the water, and it is just as common to see a boat on most driveways as it is to see a car.\n''On one Island Park waterfront the sun sets, and on the other the sun rises,'' Mrs. Scully said. The community, which has four places of worship - a synogogue and Greek Orthodox, Methodist and Roman Catholic churches - has large Italian and Greek populations. Their ethnic celebrations - a Greek festival in August and the four-day Feast of San Gennaro in September - are the annual social highlights.\nBarnum Island, named for Phineas T. Barnum, the circus impresario, who owned land there, is about the size of Island Park, as is Harbor Isle, which is connected to the village by two small bridges. Some streets on Barnum Island are separated by small canals, where homeowners can dock their boats or lease the space to others. TUCKED in a corner of Barnum Island, facing Reynolds Channel and Long Beach Hospital, are the Yacht Harbor Condominiums, only a few years old. Town-house resales cost about $200,000, Mrs. Scully said. Most units have three bedrooms and bathrooms with skylights.\nAcross the street, plans for housing the elderly are being considered for the little undeveloped land that remains in the community. No one plan has yet jelled.\n''We take care of our senior citizens as well as our young people,'' Mayor Parente said. A 40-unit apartment building for the elderly was constructed a few years ago with the help of village and Federal funds, and the county and Catholic charities furnish daily hot lunches at the American Legion lounge, where many elderly residents gather in the afternoons to play bridge.\nFor young couples, 40 one-family homes were also built under a Housing and Urban Development program in which the Federal Government matches village money to establish affordable homes for first-time homeowners. Some were built on Parente Lane, a new street, named for the mayor, that was created to make space in the village.\nMary and Richard Veit recently bought one for $130,000. ''The prices were right,'' said the 28-year-old Mrs. Veit. ''We love the area because it's quiet, clean and pretty and the people seem close. It's a good place to bring up children.''\nIsland Park has one of the county's smallest school districts, with a total of 1,270 students. They attend Frances X. Hegarty School for pre-kindergarten through third grade and the Lincoln Orens School for fourth through eighth grades.\nHigh-school students take a 20-minute bus ride to West Hempstead High School, outside the Island Park district. George Marr, the Island Park district superintendent, said bus service, sometimes until 9 P.M., assures students involved in extracurricular activities of transportation home.\nHaving a small district can produce large results, Mr. Marr said. Average class size is 19 students. Among the variety of special programs available are classes for the gifted, remedial services and an outdoor-education program that provides overnight nature-study trips to Suffolk County. Eighty-three percent of the students in the district go on to higher education.\nA 30-year tradition in the district is the eighth-graders' annual pilgrimage to Washington, where they learn firsthand about the nation's Capital with Island Park's own Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato as tour guide. A sign saying, ''Welcome to Island Park, the home of U.S. Senator Al D'Amato,'' greets visitors to the community.\nIsland Park's village board is governed by Mr. Parente and four trustees. Many residents work for the county, as Mr. D'Amato did, but for those who commute to Manhattan, a monthly L.I.R.R. ticket costs $123 for the 45-minute ride. THE village beach on Waterfront Road has a new gazebo with picnic benches for family barbecues. Most children participate in a summer recreation program which includes arts and crafts classes and swimming lessons at Hog Creek for a minimal charge. While they swim, their mothers can take advantage of exercise classes on the sand. Harbor Isle has its own small beach and playground.\nOn the outskirts of Barnum Island, Shell Creek Park offers a ballpark, basketball court and four tennis courts. Entrance to beaches and facilities cost residents less than $5 per season. Nonresidents must pay admission each time they visit.\nMcCluskey's Steakhouse is a popular village restaurant, as is Prudente's, which offers Italian cuisine. Channel 80, next to the Long Beach bridge on Reynolds Channel, draws both the singles crowd and families for Sunday brunch. The Lady 80, a motor yacht docked outside the restaurant, features dancing and drinking for summer patrons who often arrive by private plane or moor their boats in Reynolds Channel.\nIn the summertime, customers form lines outside Jordan Lobster Farms on the corner of Waterview Road to buy fresh or prepared seafood. People also wait in line at Custom Bakers, an Island Park institution since 1944, for heavy Italian cheesecake and deep-dish fruit pies. Light industry, some boat showrooms and marinas can be found along Long Beach Road and Austin Boulevard, the village's two main streets.\n''It's no wonder that we have such an in-bred community,'' Mr. Parente said. ''It's human nature that when you find something good, you just want to keep it.'' SHOWMAN'S HOME: 'A PIECE OF OUR HISTORY'\nIn 1889, Phineas T. Barnum bought about five acres of land in Island Park and the neighborhood of Barnum Island to be the winter home for his traveling circus. Village historians say he chose the area because of its proximity to the city and because it was quiet. His entourage included members of his family, performers and various show animals.\nThe animals were caged in what was known as ''Mealey's Camp,'' which included stables and sheds off what is now Austin Boulevard, near Southard Road, where Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's family now lives.\nNearby, Barnum built a grand, white-frame mansion with a large porch for his ailing sister, Phoebe. Five years later, the mansion, which overlooked Hog Creek and Island Park Beach, was sold and converted into the 30-room Island Park Hotel.\nThe hotel, which served businessmen and wealthy families vacationing at the shore, burned to the ground in the mid-60's.\n''When I was growing up, they used to tell the kids that if you dig deep enough, you can find bones from Barnum's elephants in the ground,'' said Harvey Gertler, president of the Chamber of Commerce.

Later we realized that there is no mortgage on a co-op but a loan that is a lien not on real property but on shares of the co-op corporation.\nMortgage Tax on a Co-op Question: When my husband and I closed on an equity loan on our co-op apartment, we paid a $600 mortgage tax to the title company, which it said would be disbursed to New York State. Later we realized that there is no mortgage on a co-op but a loan that is a lien not on real property but on shares of the co-op corporation. Neither the title company's lawyer nor the bank's lawyer could explain why it had been collected. Are we due a refund? . . . M. J., Rego Park, Queens Answer: No, according to David L. Smith, a real estate lawyer with the firm of Shaw and Reed. The first lien-holder on your co-op, he said, is the bank that issued the original co-op loan and as such, it took possession of the stock certificates and of the proprietary lease at the closing. The bank that issued your equity loan is in a secondary position.\n''To protect its position as the junior lienholder,'' Mr. Smith said, ''your bank insisted that a security agreement covering the stock, the proprietary lease and fixtures be recorded with the City Register as evidence of its claim.'' The City Register's position, in turn, is that when these instruments are recorded, a mortgage recording tax is paid.\n''This was a superconservative position for the bank to take,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Many banks do not want to issue equity loans on cooperatives, but when they do, it is standard for them to secure their second position by requiring that financing statements be filed.'' Reverse Mortgages Question: We are a retired couple who live in our own home in a good neighborhood, but we have a limited income. We have heard that some banks will provide a ''reverse mortgage'' that will help older people live better. Do any banks in New York offer this type of loan? . . . K. W., Queens Answer: The loans to which you are referring are known as reverse annuity mortgage loans. Some financial institutions began offering them a few years ago to allow elderly homeowners to turn the equity in their homes into income while continuing to live in them. The loan principal is paid to the homeowner in monthly installments, and the bank is reimbursed with interest in a single payment at the end of the loan period when the home is sold or the owner dies.\nIn New York State, these loans at present are available only to qualifying elderly residents of Long Island, who must apply either through the Nassau County Department of Senior Citizen Affairs or the nonprofit Family Service League, which is based in Huntington in Suffolk County. Rent on Co-op Sublet Question: Is there any restriction on the amount of rent the owner of a co-op apartment can charge when subletting the apartment? . . . G. G., Manhattan Answer: According to Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the only restriction would be in the case of a renter-occupied unit in a rent-regulated building converted under a noneviction plan. When any rent-regulated apartment is sublet, the rent may be no more than 10 percent beyond than the regular rent.\nThe owner of a rent-stabilized co-op may not unreasonably withhold consent to a sublet, and the unit may be sublet for two years out of any four-year period. If the unit is rent-controlled, the owner need not consent to a sublet unless that right was specified in the original lease.
688	Yorktown Closes the Door on Condos	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D81338F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: CONDOMINIUMS are springing up all over Westchester - but not in Yorktown.\nCONDOMINIUMS are springing up all over Westchester - but not in Yorktown.\nIn 1985, Yorktown quietly decided that condominiums were not paying their way in taxes and that no more should be built. The Town Supervisor, Nancy Elliott, said condominiums produced only two-thirds as much tax revenue as identical town houses in ''fee-simple'' ownership, in which owners have title to the land under their property instead of a share of all property.\nAs a result of the town policy, builders have switched current projects from condominiums to fee-simple town houses; for future construction, they have turned back to single-family houses, which have long been the mainstay of home builders in Yorktown.\nA trend has become evident in the figures of the Building Department and the Planning Board. In 1985, builders completed 69 single-family houses and 300 condominiums that were under construction when the policy changed. In 1986, the Planning Board gave final approval for 174 fee-simple town houses, 140 single-family houses and nine two-family houses.\nAmong the recent applications that have reached the preliminary approval stage, none were for town houses or apartments of any kind. The only ones were for 124 single-family homes and three two-family homes.\nThe difference between condominiums and fee-simple town houses is a result of a legal oddity, but it meant a loss of revenue to the town and school district, Mrs. Elliott said. Robert P. Killeen, the Town Assessor, said the owner of an average condominium pays $2,000 to $2,500 a year in taxes, the owner of a fee-simple town house pays $3,200 to $3,500 and the owner of a single-family home pays an average of $4,000.\nSo far as buyers are concerned, the units look the same and cost the same. The difference between a condominium and fee-simple town house is what Mr. Killeen called ''a postage-stamp-size lot.''\nWhile condominium owners own only their units and a share of all the land, including roads and recreation areas, the fee-simple owners are halfway between owners of houses and condominiums. The fee-simple owners own what is known as the footprint below the building and a small garden in front and back, for a total of about 25 by 100 feet, or about 1/16 acre. They pay taxes not only on that piece of land, but on a different basis on the unit itself, which accounts for most of the increase in taxes.\nThe difference arises from a 22-year-old state law that requires that condominiums be assessed as if they were rental apartments, rather than on the basis of market value, as other residential property is assessed.\nThe law was enacted when the only condominiums and cooperatives were apartments that had been converted from rental apartments, which are assessed on the basis of the income they produce. When they were converted, the old basis was kept on the theory that the assessment should be the same regardless of whether the building was owned by one person or 100.\nRecently the law has been criticized by assessors in several towns as illogical because the new condominiums were never rental units. The assessment must be set on some assumed rental, and in some communities there is no comparable rental unit to use as a basis for assessment.\nMark Phelan, spokesman for the Builders Institute, an association of Westchester and Putnam County builders, contractors and apartment owners, defends the current method of assessing condominiums.\n''We recognize that condominiums get a preferential assessment, but even with that benefit, the town still gets a benefit and no costs,'' he said. ''Condominiums pay for their own services and their own recreation, and they produce almost no schoolchildren.'' The New York Times/Alan Zale But Marc Gerber, a Chappaqua builder who is directly affected by the new Yorktown policy, said he was not perturbed by it. He has built about 200 condominiums in recent years and is planning a development called Bridle Ridge in Yorktown, which will have 70 single-family houses and 70 town houses. He said it was a ''close call'' for both builders and buyers as to which is preferable - condominiums or fee-simple town houses in which residents form a homeowners' association. ''I\nDON'T think these simple units are harder to sell, even though they have higher taxes,'' he said. ''In a homeowners' association, the roads are owned by the town, which pays to maintain them and plow them. In a condominium, the roads are pri-rrHunter Brook, among the last condominium complexes being built in Yorktown; Nancy Elliott, Supervisor. vate, and the condo owners have to pay to maintain them, which means a higher maintenance fee.''\nHe said that in a homeowners' association, owners have control over their own front and back gardens and can make their own decisions, for example, on landscaping. At the same time, he said, the associations can enact rules on outside appearances that are as strict as those in condominium complexes, which ban exterior alterations.\nYorktown enacted its regulations by policy, not by law, and has simply told builders that it prefers homeowners' associations.\n''We don't have to approve any particular type of building,'' Mrs. Elliott said. ''If builders want to come in and be part of our community, they should build what we think is right. We haven't had any trouble about it.''\nYorktown, which was the first town in northern Westchester to permit the building of condominiums, has 1,900 either completed, under construction or approved for construction.\nJefferson Village, an adults-only condominium complex, is nearing completion, with 900 of its 1,000 units built. About 260 units in four other complexes are complete, and 640 are under construction in what will be the final four complexes: Hunter Brook, on Route 132, and Chalet, Old Yorktown II and Villas on the Lake, all in Lake Mohegan, in the northern part of town.\nEven town houses in homeowners' associations may not be built in any great numbers in Yorktown in the future, Mrs. Elliott said, ''because we have run out of our nice flat farmland where it was easy to build them.''\nThe Supervisor also predicted a general swing back to single-family houses in Yorktown. She said she based her prediction not only on statistics offered by planners, but also on her own observations.\n''I make my studies standing and watching the crowds at the Yorktown Grange Fair every year,'' she said. ''You get an idea of who's around. I've begun to see a lot of pregnant ladies, and Yorktown has always been a family-oriented town. Families still prefer houses.'' IN WESTCHESTER AND CONNECTICUT

But not all hotels are luxury hotels as implied.\nThe article also states that many tourists might be staying in suburban hotels to save money. This really is not necessary since there are many hotels in New York City for tourists of moderate means in the Times Square theatrical district, the 70's, Central Park West, West End Avenue and Columbus Avenue that rent for $60 a day single and $65 double with private bath.\nMany hotels rent two-room suites for $85 a day with private bath and kitchenettes and are attractively furnished. They are close to city centers and in pleasant neighborhoods convenient to public transportation, parks, museums and theaters.\nThese lovely, medium-priced hotels have excellent accommodations and they are well-run, soundproof and clean, with television and air-conditioning and wall-to-wall carpeting. They do not, however, have swimming pools, jogging tracks or tennis courts.\nI feel badly when tourists are led to believe that they cannot go to a good hotel in our city for less than $135 a day.

The move is sure to increase trade tensions. The United States is retaliating against tariffs on American grain exports to Spain, but the Community threatened new retaliation in the form of wider grain tariffs.\nThe United States imposed duties on wine, cheese, gin and brandy imported from the European Community. The move is sure to increase trade tensions. The United States is retaliating against tariffs on American grain exports to Spain, but the Community threatened new retaliation in the form of wider grain tariffs. Some economists called the United States move a bold one by President Reagan to deal with a particularly thorny problem, but others say American consumers are the ones who will have to pay. Separately, the United States is dropping duty-free status for about $3 billion in goods from Korea, Japan and some developing nations, saying the need for duty-free status was greater elsewhere.\nThe United States justifies its actions in part by pointing to the trade deficit, which hit a record $19.2 billion in November. The gap had been narrowing for several months as more aggressive American marketing and the lower dollar began to have an effect, so the turnaround stunned most economists. It came on a surge in imports, caused in part by companies ordering goods to beat the new tax bill and the new tax on imports that took effect Dec. 1. Still, the worsening deficit is sure to increase protectionist inclinations in Congress.\nCanada will impose a 15 percent export tax on lumber, replacing a 15 percent tariff that was imposed by the United States, which said Canada was unfairly subsidizing its lumber exports. While Ottawa would prefer to have no penalty at all, officials there believed a tax at home was better than a tariff that went to the United States. But the lumber industry in Canada and many politicians there bitterly condemned the tax, saying it would cause unemployment and would set a dangerous precedent.\nJapanese chip prices were cut by the United States, which sets the level at which the chips can be sold here under a trade agreement that went into effect in July. The cut will probably please the Japanese, who have been accused of dumping their chips.\nThe dollar plunged on the trade reports amid thin year-end trading as currency traders moved into other currencies. The drop led to a surge in gold prices, traditionally a haven when currency prices are unsteady. Gold passed $400 an ounce. Leading indicators jumped 1.2 percent in November, but analysts disagreed on the significance. Most noted that the new tax bill's stricter depreciation and capital expenditures provisions were spurring companies to spend before Jan. 1, but others saw some underlying strength. . . . Factory orders surged 4.1 percent, mainly on military orders. The gain came on the heels of two disheartening drops, and was the biggest jump in two years. . . . Sales of new homes fell 2.2 percent, but sales of existing homes hit a seven-year high. . . . Spending on new construction fell seven-tenths of 1 percent.\nStocks began the year on an up note with a 31.36-point gain that canceled a year-ending slump. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.79 for the four-day trading week, ending at 1,927.31. Short-term interest rates rose sharply as traders hustled to cover year-end financing needs.\nMcDonnell Douglas will build its long-delayed wide-body jet, the MD-11, keeping it in the business of large passenger jets. The plane is a more efficient, larger-capacity jet than McDonnell's DC-10. It had hesitated to build the jet in view of stiff competition from Airbus and Boeing, but decided to go ahead when orders picked up. Still, most analysts say the plane will produce little profit.\nMerrill Lynch and I.B.M. dropped a joint venture to furnish the financial community with computerized information. While financial professionals have long been considered a perfect audience for such sophisticated services, and while the combination of I.B.M.'s computer expertise and Merrill's financial expertise seemed to make an irresistible combination, the costs were just too high and the market too small. The venture, known as Imnet, was announced in 1984.\nUSX will write off $300 million in the fourth quarter as a result of early redemption of the bonds it issued when it bought Marathon Oil for $2.9 billion in 1982. And it said it was still conducting talks with Carl C.

It would be the first such venture between American and Japanese banks.\nThe financial adviser to Guinness, Morgan Grenfell, resigned that business amid a widening stock scandal.

692	Creating Shangri-La On the Hudson	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D71338F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: ARTHUR E. IMPERATORE, looking imperial, as he always does, nervously drummed his fingers on the table. Smoke seemed about to issue from his ears. He has a famous short fuse. He said stiffly, ''We've got a lot of money sitting around here. I hear the clock ticking.''\nARTHUR E. IMPERATORE, looking imperial, as he always does, nervously drummed his fingers on the table. Smoke seemed about to issue from his ears. He has a famous short fuse. He said stiffly, ''We've got a lot of money sitting around here. I hear the clock ticking.''\nThis meeting - being held at the Manhattan offices of the architectural firm of Schuman, Lichtenstein, Claman & Efron - had been called to discuss details of a crescent-shaped apartment building Mr. Imperatore intends to build on two miles of land he owns that winds through Weehawken and West New York on the New Jersey banks of the Hudson River. It would be the first stirrings of his ideal city, which he plans to call Port Imperial.\nHe is basically a novice at real estate development. He has never built anything other than one housing project in Cliffside Park, N.J., and some truck terminals. Still, at 61, Mr. Imperatore sees no reason why an aging but active trucking magnate should not become a master builder.\nThe meeting turned to windows. How many should open? How many shouldn't? Views diverged. At one point, Mr. Imperatore interrupted to say, ''You know, we better follow these things up or we're going to be out of time. We can't keep losing a week, a week, a week.''\nMr. Imperatore is worth perhaps $200 million. The money comes from his trucking company, the APA Transport Corporation, which hauls everything imaginable along the East Coast. In the mid-70's, Mr. Imperatore fell into doleful spirits. His mother died. One of his brothers was killed in a helicopter crash. His marriage disintegrated. He was creeping up on his 60's and felt it necessary to ponder succession.\nSo he removed himself from active duties at his company. Needing a project to absorb him, he bought the big parcel of riverfront land in 1981, when wild dogs roamed on it. He got it cheap - $7.75 million - from the liquidators of the Penn Central holdings, and has already watched it multiply many times in value. Since he bought the parcel, he has been moving to create what he refers to as a Shangri-La with a glorious view of the Empire State Building. People who know him are not surprised. He has never thought small.\nThe meeting sputtered along. Mr. Imperatore consulted his watch and announced that he had to get to New Jersey. ''If I said anything insulting,'' he remarked in leaving, ''I meant it.''\nButtoning his raincoat, Mr. Imperatore bustled downstairs, jumped into his Oldsmobile and and began careening at a blood-curdling speed through traffic. ''I drive like a truck driver,'' he said. ''I used to be a truck driver. You look for opportunity and move quickly. You have to make time to get productivity.''\nRacing along, working the horn hard, he said, ''I have an esthetic eye that gives me insight and imposes a demand for high-quality esthetics and symmetry. My eye picks up asymmetry and rejects it. I'm a believer that people are affected by their environment much more than they are willing to admit consciously. I'm constantly fighting the battle of beauty and classicism and trying to compromise between what I feel people should require and have and the age of pragmatism. In my work, I'm always trying to think of how to make the world better - better human conduct, better civility, better efficiency, just a better civilization.''\nHe parked at a small pier on the Hudson River at 38th Street. This was where he had recently begun a ferry service to Weehawken - the first in 20 years - in order to carry commuters to his dream city. He boarded a motorboat, settled behind the wheel and plowed across the river to Arcorp Properties, his Weehawken real estate development company.\n''I'm 61,'' he said on the way over. ''I've worked for 50 or 51 years. I've always had an inner drive to accomplish and get things done with creativity, purpose and honesty, with a strong sense of personal discipline and control.''\nMr. Imperatore has a tall, lithe figure, sparse gray hair and a bulbous nose. He often wears a sort of tired, sad look. His voice, which he uses often, is like creaky hinges and his speech is generously laced with swearwords. He treats people well, providing they work harder than they ever thought they could.\n''I have great respect for people,'' he said. ''And I demand respect - because I earned it.''\nHis city, he explained, will be in the ''Greco-Roman tradition.'' It will contain 12,500 housing units, 10 million square feet of office space, a hotel and a cultural center. The cost may reach $6 billion. Construction is expected to span two decades. Mr. Imperatore hopes he'll see it all.\nIn doing his planning, Mr. Imperatore dropped in on more than 50 cities to borrow ideas. Slices of Venice, Copenhagen and Paris will reappear on the New Jersey waterfront: a town square reminiscent of Venice's Piazza San Marco, an 800-foot observation tower derived from a Leonardo da Vinci sketch, a boulevard that some refer to as the ''Champs Elysees of Weehawken,'' an entertainment center mimicking Copenhagen's Tivoli Gardens.\nAsk him who will live in the city, and Mr. Imperatore responds firmly: ''The world.''\nThe world must wait, however. Ground-breaking for the first apartment building is not scheduled until September, and Mr. Imperatore faces rabid competition along the waterfront.\n''Even if his proposal can succeed on its own, 10 or 15 years down the line it's going to have to withstand competition from all the other developments on the West Bank of the Hudson River,'' said Martin Bierbaum, assistant professor in the graduate public administration program at Rutgers University. ''That area could turn out to be a total disaster.''\n''I think that Arthur Imperatore, while he's a wonderful guy, is really a novice at real estate,'' said Joe Barry, a developer in Hoboken. ''What he's proposing is on such a massive scale that he's not going to have much learning time. You have to do more than throw a lot of money at a project.''\nDonald Trump, in a recent television interview, succinctly summed up Mr. Imperatore's chunk of land as ''garbage.''\nMr. Imperatore huffs that anyone who doubts him doesn't know him. He says that he will soon be announcing a joint venture on his property with a large, seasoned developer that will silence a lot of naysayers.\nArthur Imperatore wasn't always special. That didn't start, he says, until he was at least 2. When he was 10 he decided to become a millionaire.\nThat was quite a dream for someone who was one of 10 children of an Italian immigrant who ran a grocery store. There was no money in the Imperatore house. The 10 children shared two drab bedrooms. Meals were taken at an ironing board that teetered across two chairs. (Still, there was a regal tradition: In Latin, the family name means emperor.) This was happening in West New York, where Mr. Imperatore was born on July 8, 1925. At 7, Mr. Imperatore helped his family with deliveries. He mopped floors at a candy store. He was a Western Union messenger. He was a Fuller Brush man. He had a bank account when he was 9. He never went to college.\n''My interest as a kid was in doing something, making money and putting my family on the map,'' he said.\nTrucks gave him the opportunity. In 1947, along with four of his brothers, he established the rudiments of APA Transport with two Army surplus trucks operating out of the Imperatore house. Under Mr. Imperatore's tight-fisted rule, the company flourished as one of the industry's most profitable truckers. The New York-New Jersey area is one of the most miserable in the country for labor-management squabbling (his drivers belong to the teamsters union). Yet APA became legendary for stellar management and profitability. In 1985, he says, the company earned $8.4 million on revenues of $98.7 million.\nAPA's stringent hiring policies are perhaps the key to its success. Want to drive an APA truck? You must withstand endless interviews, a drug test, a polygraph test in states that allow it and a week's orientation at no pay. To weed out crooks among new applicants, APA subscribes to 45 daily newspapers, and four people work full-time clipping out stories about arrests. From these, a master roster of dubious names is compiled, which right now lists more than 1.6 million people.\nMr. Imperatore remains APA's chairman, but the place is run on a daily basis by its president, Armand Pohan, who is Mr. Imperatore's stepson. Earlier last year, in order to grow, the company bought Sanborn's Motor Express, a Maine trucker. There have been problems melding the two together, since a lot of Sanborn drivers who are not up to APA's standards have left or been let go.\nOne of the most remarkable things about APA is its reputation for being ''clean'' in an industry that is often dirty.\n''We don't stand for corruption of any people for any reason,'' Mr. Imperatore said. ''I.B.M., Ross Perot -we didn't copy any of those guys in how to be honest. We invented this stuff down here in the swamps. The Japanese didn't teach me anything. We grew up in the worst kind of crud. The teamster influence? Some of those guys are in prison right now. They tried to strong-arm us. But they didn't. We never bought peace.''\nIn fact, even the Teamsters seem to approve of Arthur Imperatore. ''He's fair, he's just, he's tough,'' says Walter Shea, an international vice president with the union, who has known Mr. Imperatore for many years. ''We rarely have a grievance with him. If everyone was like Arthur, we probably wouldn't have unions.''\nMr. Imperatore is tougher than nails. But he's also generous to his people. In 1973, for instance, he opened a $1 million recreation center for workers and their families at the APA main terminal in North Bergen. The basketball court is so good that the New Jersey Nets practice on it.\nMr. Imperatore treats himself well, too. His immense office at APA is a splendid replica of the drawing room of a 17th-century Venetian prince. ''Nice office, huh?'' he likes to say to visitors. ''I deserve it.''\nUntil recently, he lived in a mansion perched on a bluff in Fort Lee, N.J., though now he rents an apartment in Manhattan while quarters are being prepared for him in the Arcorp Properties headquarters. He's still separated from his wife and lives alone; he has a son and daughter, who are both in graduate school. He owns a 141-foot yacht, the Imperator, which contains artwork by Boudin, Monet and Pissarro. He likes to float in the yacht down the Hudson, peering at his acreage and smiling contentedly to himself.\nMr. Imperatore had to meet someone at the office of a marina that operates on his property. Walking in, he noticed the carpeting was soiled. He barked at the attendant: ''Why is this carpet dirty? That's grease.''\nThe phone trilled. The attendant picked it up. ''Listen to me,'' Mr. Imperatore snapped. ''Tell whoever it is you'll call back. I'm talking. Get someone to come and clean that.''\nTidiness is a fanaticism of Mr. Imperatore's. At any given time, his coat pockets are apt to be stuffed with sundry balled-up scraps of litter he has spied on the ground. ''You see how dirty the world is and then you come to my property and it's clean,'' he said. ''People enjoy working in a clean, neat environment. I think people deserve that.''\nStill fuming about the greasy rug, Mr. Imperatore left the office. He noticed a crumpled Hershey bar wrapper on the ground, picked it up and stashed it in his pocket.\n''I want to show you something,'' Arthur Imperatore said, driving through the streets of North Bergen. He pulled up alongside a nondescript two-story house, swung out of the car and punched the bell. This was the house he was born in. Now he owns it. One of his brothers lives in it with his wife.\nHis brother was out, but his wife answered in her bathrobe.\n''Oh, Arthur, why don't you give me warning?'' she said.\n''I didn't have warning,'' Mr. Imperatore said.\nThe living room was small, plain, crowded. Mr. Imperatore paced about. ''This was where I started,'' he said. ''Ten kids in two rooms. It was a mess.''\n''What my project is about,'' he continued, ''is I want to help the milieu in which I built my business. I made my fortune here and I believe in the community. I have an idea of perfecting a piece of the world.''\n''Some coffee, Arthur?'' his sister-in-law interrupted.\n''No time,'' Mr. Imperatore said. ''Gotta go.'' On a gray, snowy day, Arthur Imperatore's car eased to a halt in front of APA headquarters. The letters in the company's name happen to stand for nothing, though employees quip that they are short for ''Always Please Arthur.'' As he threaded his way to his office, Mr. Imperatore called out effusive greetings to the drivers. Some of them he hugged. He asked after the health of relatives.\nAs he mounted the stairs, his eyes were trained on the carpet. ''Look at this,'' he said to one of the vice presidents, and nabbed two pieces of litter. ''You guys let this place go to pot.'' Then he said, ''When I was building the company, I was introduced to a book called 'Acres of Diamonds.' It was about a man who had a great farm but he was restless and greedy and failed to work his farm. So he sold it and the man who bought it worked it and found on the farm the acres of diamonds. The moral is, if you work hard you find opportunities.'\nHe plopped down in his office and stared into the distance. ''Men love to work,'' he said. ''They want leadership and to be taught their work, their craft, to make a better world, a small chunk of immortality by their work.''\n''We bring out the heroism in people,'' he continued. ''I used to do it in a masterful way. I don't know if they're screwing it up now. I think they are, actually.''\nAfter a while, he got into his car to circle the snowy yard. A rule is that drivers have 5 minutes to get their trucks on the road. Most made it. A few dawdled.\nMr. Imperatore pulled up alongside a driver who was still getting his truck ready to roll. ''Get out of here,'' he told him. ''You can talk to the freight, but it won't walk.''\n''I know, Arthur, I know,'' the driver said.\n''If I weren't in this car, you'd get a snowball,'' Mr. Imperatore said. ''Now get out of here.'' Mr. Imperatore headed for the exit to go to the waterfront. Suddenly, he braked, opened his door and leaned out. He snatched up a gum wrapper and put it in his pocket.\nTRUCKER TURNED BUILDER: ARTHUR E. IMPERATORE
693	THE AX FALLS ON EQUAL OPPORTUNITY	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D71338F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: IT seemed like a great idea last October, when the subject first came up. Black Agency Executives, an association of black directors of social service agencies in New York City, would invite about 60 black corporate executives of major national companies to a conference in April. The talk would be of fund raising, of board memberships, of management techniques, of all kinds of subjects on which the two groups could offer mutual assistance.\nIT seemed like a great idea last October, when the subject first came up. Black Agency Executives, an association of black directors of social service agencies in New York City, would invite about 60 black corporate executives of major national companies to a conference in April. The talk would be of fund raising, of board memberships, of management techniques, of all kinds of subjects on which the two groups could offer mutual assistance.\nThe idea has since been scuttled. ''The ranks of blacks in corporations have been so decimated there just wouldn't be enough people to come,'' says John N. Odom, B.A.E.'s director.\nAcross the country, black managers have been losing their jobs at an accelerated pace. Executive recruiters report that resumes from discharged black managers are flooding their offices, while assignments to recruit them - or anyone at the middle management level - are few and far between.\nSo far, black engineers, sales managers and others in jobs that deal directly with products have been spared. And most experts say that lower-level black workers, many of whom are in unions, have fared no worse than their white counterparts in the wave of firings sweeping the country.\nBut blacks in public affairs, community relations, human resources - all of the staff-support areas that have become havens for blacks and women trying to make it into the mainstream of corporate America - are finding their jobs, and their paychecks, gone. ''For years, blacks and women were steered into jobs that were not central to the organization,'' said Mary Anne Devanna, research director at the Columbia Business School's Management Institute. ''Now these are precisely the jobs that are being eliminated.''\nMembers of an increasingly angry black managerial community feel the dismissals have dealt them a one-two punch. They see themselves and their colleagues, far more than white women, back at square one in their careers, often after decades of employment with the same company. And since many of the fired managers were responsible for recruiting and guiding entry-level blacks through the corporate shoals, they say the trend bodes extremely ill for younger black would-be managers.\n''The whole country has gone backwards in the sense of equal opportunity,'' said Sheila Clark, 38, a black single parent who last month lost her job as director of career development at CBS Inc. ''It's like a door opened and suddenly it shut in your face.''\nAlthough the corporate ax is falling on managers of all colors and races, black executives say it has fallen disproportionately hard on them as a group. According to David L. Vaughn, president of the National Urban Affairs Council, the number of executive jobs in the New York metropolitan area has shrunk by about 9 percent in the last couple of years. Well over half of the jobs that were eliminated, he says, had been held by blacks - a percentage that far exceeds black representation in managerial jobs.\nOther black executives cite similar figures. ''Mergers and acquisitions have cut the legs out of the movement of blacks in the corporate world,'' says Sullivan Robinson, head of Associated Black Charities, a 59-member federation of New York social services agencies. ''Corporate America has made a decision to whiten up again. It can't be coincidental. The numbers are just too extreme.''\nAlthough specific numbers are impossible to unearth, most employment experts say it is because of weak information-gathering methods, not because the figures are wrong. ''We have little information about what's happening in specific occupations and little information about minorities, so hard data related to both are really hard to come by,'' explains Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nBut calls to several universities, management associations, and executive search firms turned up a widespread perception of a vicious cycle: Black executives are often promoted to head Equal Employment Opportunity compliance and other minority-related areas, and because these jobs have little immediate impact on corporate bottom lines, they are the first to go in any cutback. ''Companies wind up so worried about quarterly profits that they cut out not only fat but fundamentally important social commitments,'' says James A. F. Stoner, professor of management at Fordham University's Graduate School of Business.\nThe pressure seems to be off from Washington. Many companies report that inspections by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, a major enforcement arm for anti-discrimination regulations, are far less thorough than they were in previous Administrations, and that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is not living up to its rules.\nClarence Thomas, chairman of the E.E.O.C., insists that ''the facts belie any such statements'' and that this year his agency filed a record number of lawsuits and class actions on behalf of individuals who charged discrimination.\nBut blatant discrimination is not the issue in American business today, most blacks contend. And business experts tend to agree more with the perceptions of the black community than with the E.E.O.C. ''Politically, there is no longer a guardian angel for affirmative action,'' said Paul Hirsch, a professor at the University of Chicago.\nNewly unemployed blacks are more blunt. ''There's a consensus that E.E.O. was never really a part of the corporation, just something that had to be done under a different Administration,'' said Joseph E. Burgess, 51, a former assistant vice president of human resources at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company who was, in his words, ''reorganized out of a job'' in February. IN A sense, corporations can argue a degree of color-blindness in their widespread staff cuts. The huge number of mergers in recent years has meant wholesale elimination of duplicate jobs of all types, along the theory that no company needs two controllers or two heads of investor relations.\nAt the same time, manufacturing companies are facing an unprecedented flood of low-priced import competition, and have been slashing their payrolls in an attempt to get costs low enough so that they can compete effectively. Airlines, telecommunications companies, and other companies operating in newly deregulated environments are finding unfamiliar price competition threatening their existence if they do not get costs down.\nThe fickleness of management theory has also had a deleterious impact on staff jobs, including E.E.O.-type positions. In the last decade, management consultants, professors and other self-styled experts preached the virtues of formal strategic planning, psychologically oriented training programs, internal consulting groups, and other staff support functions. Corporations listened and acted accordingly, with the result that these staff jobs flourished in number and salary.\nNow, though, theories along the lines of those espoused by Thomas J. Peters and Robert H. Waterman Jr. in the best-selling ''In Search of Excellence'' have glorified companies with super-lean headquarters staffs and with decision-making done by the line managers, the people who actually run the manufacturing operations or market the products.\nThe overall result has been a nationwide downsizing of corporate staffs, usually described as trimming the fat from management. And, black executives charge, it is their jobs that are most often classified as ''fat.''\nAlthough corporations will not give specific numbers, they deny this. ''It is absolutely true that American companies are slimming down and cutting costs,'' said Ford Slater, manager of special issues, planning and communications for the General Electric Company. G.E., he says, reduced its overall payroll by 100,000 people - 25 percent of its work force - from 1981 to 1985.\nMr. Slater insists that ''while the total number of G.E. managers and professionals has declined, the percentage of minorities and women in those categories has stayed about the same, or even increased.'' He predicts that G.E.'s acquisition of RCA -at $6.28 billion, the largest non-oil merger in history - will not have a disproportionate effect on black executives, either.\nJames C. Doyle, Met Life's vice president of employee relations, also bridles at any suggestion that the company might treat blacks more shabbily than whites. ''The line managers have taken over the routine work of E.E.O. They prepare their own affirmative action plans and do their own contact with the Government agencies checking compliance,'' he said. ''So we've been able to eliminate supervisory layers at headquarters. But we've had no change in the percentage of minorities that are managers.''\nEven companies that have publicly announced plans for sizable slim-downs say that blacks need not be disproportionately alarmed. ''Our cutbacks will show no lessening of commitment to affirmative action, E.E.O. or any of these areas,'' says a spokesman for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which announced on Dec. 18 that it would cut 27,400 jobs. BUT black leaders and academics seem unconvinced by corporate protestations. Though few cite instances of blatant discrimination, or even of a ''last in, first out'' approach to firing black executives, they say that for the past 20 years, educated, articulate blacks have been steered into jobs in which they deal primarily with minority issues. And they say that the Reagan Administration's lack of emphasis on monitoring compliance with the E.E.O.C.'s antidiscrimination rules, has enabled companies to cut those jobs with little fear of repercussions.\n''Some corporations are still somewhat dedicated to helping minorities, but there is no push from the Government compared to what it once was,'' said Ernest A. Richardson, a 61-year-old black consultant who two years ago left a 20-year career with the St. Regis Corporation after he and Champion International, the company that took over St. Regis, reached what he calls a ''happy understanding'' that the affirmative action programs that he ran would be pushed down to the branches.\nMr. Richardson was not fired, and he says his consulting company is doing quite well. Still, in one way he is typical of black executives who are paying a high price for career decisions that, they say, white-dominated corporations strongly urged them to make years ago. Mr. Richardson's degree is in accounting. It was at St. Regis's suggestion that he switched his career to minority relations.\nThat story is repeated again and again among black professionals, says Mr. Vaughn of the Urban Affairs Council. ''Throughout the 1970's, black people, even those with engineering degrees, were lured into managing affirmative action programs and the like,'' he says. ''They were told this was a way to get a foot in the door, they can switch over later. But the fact is, there is no mobility of blacks in corporate America today.''\nFor a time, blacks had reason to believe that these jobs represented their best shots at the top. ''In most companies, the first black to get a vice presidential position was within the human resources sector,'' said Ronald Anderson, director of minority relations at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. ''So many blacks felt this was a place where you could really rocket off. They didn't realize it had become a black managerial ghetto, that these jobs, with their great salaries, would hurt their careers down the road.''\nOther blacks readily gave up line jobs to take an active role in E.E.O. James Nixon, whose job as director of ITT's equal opportunity operations ended with the New Year, started off as a nuclear engineer with another company, G.E. In the mid-1960's, G.E. asked him to be part of a nationwide effort to study its E.E.O. programs. ''I recommended that they have a headquarters organization for this, and they agreed,'' the 53-year-old executive recalled. ''So I became the head of E.E.O.''\nG.E., Mr. Nixon says, made no attempt to stereotype him. In fact, in 1973 he moved out of E.E.O. and became a sales manager for G.E. in Detroit. But he, too, wound up back in E.E.O. work, when ITT, the giant telecommunications conglomerate, lured him away from G.E. with offers of high status and big bucks. ''ITT decided to upgrade its E.E.O. effort,'' he said. ''They made me an offer I couldn't refuse.''\nSince then, Mr. Nixon has seen his E.E.O. department at ITT reduced from 18 people to 6 and now, to none. But much of that interim reduction, he says, was a result of increased automation and productivity on his staff's part.\nIn any event, he is philosophical rather than bitter about how his career turned out. ''My attitude is, I play the game and I play it well, and when the game is over I look for another game,'' he says. ''The saying is, 'When white America gets a cold, blacks get pneumonia.' But we fought our way into this managerial group. What makes us think we're immune to its problems?''\nBut Mr. Nixon's attitude is not a typical one within the black community, or among black managers at ITT. Harold Anderson, who is now in his mid-40's, was with ITT for 15 years, most recently as manager of public affairs. A few months ago, when he realized he was likely to lose his job, he left the company to join the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem at a considerable cut in salary.\n''I was about to become the only male head of household to be cut in my department,'' Mr. Anderson said. Was this because he is black? ''I don't want to think that about ITT, but I have a suspicion. For a while, Federal statutes for E.E.O. kept minorities a pretty protected class at ITT, but with the Reagan Administration's de-emphasis of E.E.O., ITT no longer saw fit to make this a special group to protect.''\nITT calls that supposition ridiculous. ''If it was Harold's perception that any group was treated as a special group to protect, he is wrong,'' said James P. Gallagher, director of public relations, who headed the department Mr. Anderson worked for. ''We had a percentage by which we had to reduce head count. I told Harold that his responsibilities would no longer be handled by this department. I've recently had to tell four or five white people the same thing.''\nThose fired blacks who are still pounding the pavements are finding it hard to give corporate America the benefit of the doubt. They are particularly angry about what they see as unfair stereotyping of their skills. ''God forbid you say you had anything to do with women or minorities, you're told that's passe,'' said Ms. Clark of CBS, who has an M.B.A. in human resources. ''When you say that's not your entire background, they don't want to hear it. If you're black they think you can't do anything but affirmative action.'' Mr. Burgess of Met Life, who also has a master's degree in human resources and development and is an elected member of the Yonkers City Council, has similar complaints. ''We E.E.O. professionals are recruiters, consultants, and career counselors, and we know corporate chemistry maybe better than anyone else in the company,'' he said. ''But these skills are not considered transferable in the case of blacks. They look at us and say, 'You're just an E.E.O. person.' '' THE answer for a growing number of middle-aged corporate blacks is to start their own companies. Mr. Nixon's employment contract still has a few years to run, so he could stay with ITT if he wished. He doesn't wish - instead, he is taking a lump sum and starting a consulting/ venture capital company aimed at helping other blacks start their own businesses. ''I've been preaching for 11 years that blacks have to get into entrepreneurship,'' he said. ''So I'm going to help them do it.''\nMany younger blacks still have their sights set on the corporate world. But they are far less likely, experts say, to try to rise through the personnel or public affairs route. ''Blacks coming out of business schools have recognized that this is a trap and are saying they want nuts-and-bolts experience,'' said Mr. Anderson of the University of Chicago.\nSome companies say they would welcome an infusion of minority talent into their technical ranks. ''We are terribly concerned about the future source of brilliant engineers and scientists, and we recognize that one of the great untapped pools is women and minorities,'' said Mr. Slater of G.E., who adds that his company awards scholarships to promising minority students and subsidizes the salaries of black engineering and science teachers.\nBlack executives themselves also express some well-tempered optimism. ''The good news is that blacks are being recruited into mainline positions, but the bad news is that it is very slow,'' says Mr. Anderson. Added Mr. Richardson, the former St. Regis manager: ''There will never be a return to what affirmative action and E.E.O. once was, but if you have it and you really believe in yourself, you're going to make it - if not to chairman of the board, into upper management.''\nAcademics say the prognosis may be even better than that. ''If you think of equity and efficiency as major concerns in corporations, and you think of a pendulum swinging between the two, you realize that what is happening now is that the pendulum is swinging toward efficiency,'' said George Milkovich, a professor of human resources at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. ''But the concern for equity will come back.''\nIf corporations do not give blacks parity, society will force them to, Mr. Milkovich adds. ''Neither labor law nor civil rights happened in a vacuum,'' he said. ''Society reacts, and politicians react to societal pressure. And nothing rivets corporate attention like the threat of a $40 million lawsuit or fine.'' BLACK FUNDRAISERS GO BACK TO SQUARE ONE\nAsk Sullivan Robinson, head of Associated Black Charities, what fund raising is like these days, and her frustration almost overwhelms the questioner. ''This February, we're introducing a Black History Makers award, and I need corporate underwriting,'' she says. ''I went to call my old mainstays. What happened? I learned that Richard Neblett, who was in charge of corporate contributions at Exxon, had been fast-tracked to retirement. The black man who had handled contributions at Chase Manhattan was doing something else. Wesley Streeter, my main contact at RCA, is gone.''\nThe downsizing of headquarters staffs and the wholesale elimination of entire job categories typically filled by blacks have had repercussions far beyond the world of black executives. Directors of charitable organizations and social service programs aimed at the black community are finding that some of their best fund-raising contacts are no longer on the scene. The result, they say, is that when corporations re-evaluate their charitable contributions, black charities often do not make it past the first cut.\n''In the late 60's and early 70's, corporations were really helpful in terms of funding to social services agencies,'' said John N. Odom, director of Black Agency Executives, an association of black directors of social service agencies in New York City. ''But now, organizations like ballet groups and art museums are doing better than they have in the past, while social services, particularly for minorities, are doing worse.''\nBlack charities have been among numerous sufferers in the tightening of charitable purse strings in corporations. ITT, for example, has eliminated a program for funding athletics for black youths. In fact, Harold Anderson, who had been liaison for that and similar programs, has been let go.\nBut the company insists that his continued presence would have made little difference. The reason: ITT's much-publicized telecommunications joint venture with France has meant that revenues flowing directly to the corporation will be appreciably cut. ''We've always made contributions as a percentage of sales, and we're eliminating about $6 billion in sales through the joint venture,'' said James P. Gallagher, director of public relations. ''So we've cut back on contributions programs across the board, black and white.''\nSimilarly, General Electric executives insist that the merger with RCA, and resulting staff cutbacks, will not have a disproportionate impact on black charities. ''I would expect that the grand total of charitable contributions for RCA plus G.E. would be down somewhat next year from 1986, but minority-related contributions might actually go up as a percent,'' said Ford Slater, G.E.'s manager of special issues, planning and communications.\nBut even if the overall flow of corporate dollars to the black community remains sizable, it will represent cold comfort to individual fund raisers. Most have spent countless hours maintaining contacts with specific individuals in large corporations so that, when those companies choose from the myriad causes needing financial support, their names are likely to be high on the list. ''I now have to find new liaisons, establish new rapports,'' says Ms. Robinson. ''And that takes years.''
694	Technology Gets More Complex	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D71338F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THREE years ago, when Joseph Newman set out to market an automated building system so sophisticated that it would turn off lights, turn up the heat or turn on the air-conditioning based on the commands of something called ''an occupancy sensor,'' he found few takers.\nTHREE years ago, when Joseph Newman set out to market an automated building system so sophisticated that it would turn off lights, turn up the heat or turn on the air-conditioning based on the commands of something called ''an occupancy sensor,'' he found few takers.\n''We couldn't give it away,'' said Mr. Newman, who is president of the Tishman Research Company. When he talked up the large potential for saving energy and streamlining building management, he ran into the inevitable question: What's wrong with a light switch?\n''What's wrong is that nobody turns the lights out when they leave,'' Mr. Newman said. But the lean years of peddling Infracon, as his company's sensors are called, are gone for now and Mr. Newman says more than 100,000 systems have been sold since 1983.\nMr. Newman, whose company has its headquarters in New York City, also acknowledges that what passes for a ''smart'' building today could be obsolete in a few years.\nThis point was highlighted by a recent Energy Expo in Seattle, where the latest in building technologies were unveiled in a contest financed by the Federal Government to encourage high-tech, energy-efficient buildings.\n''These buildings are the laboratories themselves, models for the rest of the nation,'' said Sarah Lee, a spokesman for the Energy Edge, which sponsored the contest and gave winners large cash grants.\nSome of the judges' favorites include a maritime center that uses icy Puget Sound water as a source for heating and cooling the building, a 62-story skyscraper sheathed with ''smart windows'' that regulate the amount of sunlight they admit, and an office building with ''parabolic'' lighting fixtures designed to focus light better than flat systems.\nVery soon, Mr. Newman said, a system will be available to monitor internal air quality, purge bad air and replace it with fresh air as needed.\nAlready, there are systems that heat and cool, not by the dictates of a thermostat, but from sensors that react to the number of people in a room or the amount of daylight.\nTo keep up with the innovations, Mr. Newman and others started the Intelligent Building Institute in Washington to dispel what they perceive as the confusion over what is or is not a ''smart'' - or ''intelligent,'' as Mr. Newman prefers - building.\n''What's happened in the last few years is that buildings have become more complex and can do more things, so there has been more confusion,'' he said. And it could get worse. ''In the not-too-distant future,'' Mr. Newman said, ''you're going to see a sea of sensors.''\nJust around the corner from the basic smoke detectors and sprinkler heads, he said, are ''diagnostic sensors'' for heat, light, security and air quality.\nIn Portland, Ore., Ronald W. Huegli has designed a wall system so airtight and insulated that it all but eliminates any variations in the environment. He spent eight years developing his Mono-lite prefabricated walls, which provide an insulating value of R-50 in a single panel less than five inches thick. To achieve that sort of enclosure in standard construction would require a wall more than a foot thick and packed with insulation, most experts say.\nBut who needs R-50 when even the strictest building codes call for somewhere around R-32?\n''We found,'' Mr. Huegli said, ''that no matter what the temperature outside, it you have such high insulation value it costs very little to maintain the temperature inside.''\nOriginally, he used his system to grow vegetables inside his ''growth chambers,'' as he called the super-insulated gardens in a box that he manufactured.\nHis wall panels, composed mostly of silica, which is used in making glass, were redesigned to have more structural strength. Other ideas came from the designs of spacecraft and jet fighter planes, which depend on lightweight, composite material.\n''WHAT we've done is taken some of the aerospace technology and brought it down to everyday use,'' said Mr. Huegli, a 43-year-old mechanical engineer. His proposal to build a 90,000-square-foot corporate headquarters with floors and walls made of Mono-lite was convincing enough to the Energy Edge project, which provided a grant, and several investors, who provided $6 million. Groundbreaking is set for the spring.\nAnother Energy Edge winner, 21-story Bellevue Place east of Seattle, will use heating and cooling based on an ice-maker. During the night, a pair of 200-ton chillers produce ice for daytime cooling. The rejected heat from the chiller is then recyled during the morning warmup period. This ''smart'' system, first designed on a computer model, is so efficient that the engineers were able to get rid of a whole floor of machinery, providing added rentable space for the developer. Most of the new building technologies are wired into a central nervous sytem, a computer that controls all the functions through a network of optical fibers. In Seattle's 76-story Columbia Center, for example, the building's ''brain'' can tell at any time if someone entered his office and how long he stayed, even if he just stopped in for a minute over the weekend.\nWhat this does, says Martin Selig, the center's owner, is eliminate the old excuse of ''I'm working late at the office.''\nA pioneer in automated buildings is CityPlace, a 38-story office tower erected four years ago in Hartford. At the time, it was touted as the world's first fully computerized building.\n''They called this a building with a brain,'' said Larry Guilmette, building manager of CityPlace. ''But it's a building with many brains.''\nMost of the time, those brains do their job. But despite its body-heat sensors, customized computers for every third floor, fiber-optic ''data highway'' in the building's spine and talking elevators, Mr. Guilmette acknowledged that there was ''a rough period'' when everything did not run as smooth as planned.\nBut the cerebral structure has settled down and, he said proudly, ''we have never had to use the manual overide.''

The talk is of Bolton Valley's new gourmet restaurant, of improvements to the health club, of the finishing touches on the just-completed 65-unit hotel/condominium, of the child care center schedule, of its four new boutiques.\nTHE first snow of the winter is on the ground and the wind is howling outside as the staff of the Bolton Valley ski area gathers for a meeting. The talk is of Bolton Valley's new gourmet restaurant, of improvements to the health club, of the finishing touches on the just-completed 65-unit hotel/condominium, of the child care center schedule, of its four new boutiques.\nThe talk, it seems, is of everything but skiing.\nRalph DesLauriers, Bolton Valley's president, looking casual but dapper in a tie and sweater, slacks and hiking boots, explained later in his office. ''Anyone who thinks he is just in the business of getting people up and down mountains,'' he said, ''will find himself out of business real fast.''\nOn the surface, it is a worrywart type of comment. Unlike their counterparts in California, where the snow has been sparse, Eastern ski areas are gearing up for a heady year. Attendance at pre-season ski shows has been high, and the 20 members of the Vermont Ski Areas Association report a steady flow of inquiries and reservations. Resorts in Maine and New Hampshire are enjoying similar good news.\nBut Mr. DesLauriers's caution is realistic. Of the 882 ski areas in existence nationwide in 1979, there are 650 today, according to the National Ski Areas Association. The ones that have closed are victims of poor planning, mismanagement and increased competition, says Robert Fernald, a financial specialist with Sno-engineering of Lyme, N.H., a consultant to the ski industry.\nTo make matters worse, airline deregulation and the resulting bargain air fares have meant that ''we're competing with a beach in Acapulco or a trip to the Caribbean,'' says Scott Van Pelt, director of marketing at Okemo Mountain Ski Area in Ludlow, Vt. ''It's frightening to think about, but no one has to ski.''\nSki area operators across the country have responded to this realization with an increase in amenities to please skiers and non-skiers of all ages. They have put in tanning salons, indoor tennis courts and swimming pools, ice rinks, sleigh rides and child care. They have set up special events ranging from wine tastings to business seminars.\nThe result, industry experts say, is that nowadays most ski resorts derive only 60 percent of their revenues from lift tickets, lessons and equipment rentals. About 12 percent comes from real estate, 11 percent from food and beverages, 4 percent from sales of equiment and clothing, and 13 percent from miscellaneous services.\nSki resorts have been aggressively marketing their new offerings. A recent magazine advertisement for the Killington Ski Area, in Sherburne, Vt., the largest ski area in the East, shows a pile of recreational equipment -camera, tennis racquet, jogging shoes, ice skates, bathing suit and sunglasses - above the words ''A lot of people who vacation at Killington also bring skis.'' AMERICANS adopted skiing in a big way in 1960, when the Winter Olympics, held that year at Squaw Valley, Calif., included alpine skiing for the first time. At first all ski areas benefited from the new fad. But it was not long before skiers tired of unpredictable and sometimes meager snowfalls in the East, and went West to such resorts as Colorado's Vail, Steamboat Springs, and Keystone, and California's Mammoth.\nSeveral seasons of poor snow during the 1970's made the East even less attractive. Western resorts frantically built new ski areas, and expanded old ones with expensive condominiums. Their Eastern counterparts, meanwhile, expanded at a snail's pace. Throughout that decade, the West saw average annual growth rates in skier-days of about 9 percent while the East was making do with growth rates of 3 percent.\nNow it looks like the tables are turning. Technological breakthroughs in snow making mean that Eastern resorts can offer skiers a steady supply of snow under almost all conditions - something that Western resorts, which have not built up snow-making capacity, cannot do.\nThe West reported an ''underwhelming'' season in 1985-86, with a drop of 4.3 percent in skier-days in the Rocky Mountains and of 13.7 percent in the Far West, says Charles Goeld ner, associate dean of the College of Business at the University of Colorado in Boulder, who does an annual economic analysis for the National Ski Areas Association. The Northeast, however, showed an increase of about 16 percent in skier-days.\nThe result is a ''large reservoir of unsold condominiums'' in Utah and Colorado, says Jim Branch, president of Sno-engineering, and a profit drain at some western ski areas. Eastern ski operators, meanwhile, are congratulating themselves for investing in snow making equipment and taking a cautious approach to growth.\n''I think it might have something to do with Yankee frugalness,'' says Kathe Dillman, marketing and communications director for the National Ski Areas Association, Springfield, Mass. ''As they do things in New England, they don't overextend. They proceed at a healthy economic pace.''\nBolton Valley's pace is typical for the East. Mr. DesLauriers, a Vermont farmboy turned entrepreneur, opened it on Ricker Mountain, about 20 miles east of Burlington, in 1966. Four years later, he began building slope-side condominiums. Four years after that he added a cross-country skiing center. Then came the health club. In the last two years, Mr. DesLauriers, now 51 years old, has spent $5 million on a restaurant, shops, seven new trails, a high-tech four-person lift, 10,000 additional feet of pipeline for making snow, and a 65-unit hotel/condominium. NONE of the Eastern ski areas, Killington included, is taking future health for granted. They are trying to lure new skiers to the slopes, concentrating not just on the traditional pool of 17-to-25 year olds but on professional women, families and the elderly. Gone from their ads and brochures are the ''snow bunnies,'' svelte young women in high-fashion outfits. In their place are smiling groups of thirty-ish women, families with bundled-up tots and silver-haired skiers holding hands.\nThe New England resorts are not only trying to get them up to the slopes, but also want them to stay longer. Killington, whose 17 ski lifts make it the east's largest ski area, is marketing a variety of week-long packages. It is sponsoring a Dale Carnegie course that begins each morning on the slopes and ends each afternoon in the classroom. There is an investment seminar for those who want to mix tax shelters with schussing, several ''Champagne Ski Weeks'' co-sponsored by Paul Masson wines, a race week, winter carnivals and a Canadian-American ski week.\nEach special package has its own itinerary, with activities like dances, cocktail parties, films, fireworks and celebrity appearances. Many of the events have corporate co-sponsors.\nThe packages have paid off. Killington, one of the few publicly-held ski areas in the East, just finished its 27th consecutive profitable year. Killington and its sister slope, Mount Snow, had combined net income of $3.5 million on revenues of $56 million in 1985.\nSki areas often need every penny they make simply to meet the skyrocketing costs of operation. Liability insurance costs have soared, as they have in all industries. Mr. DesLauriers says Bolton Valley's liability insurance premiums last year leapt from $30,000 to $100,000 - more than all claims paid out since the area opened, he says. This year, his premium cost is $200,000. The high cost of liability insurance has raised the cost of lift tickets enormously, and has caused some smaller areas to close. The ski industry is lobbying for state laws that would, among other things, put a cap on non-economic damages such as pain and suffering and eliminate punitive damages.\nEnvironmental rules also make expansion costly. Mr. DesLauriers says that obtaining permits delayed his current expansion project a year, and added about $300,000 in consulting and engineering fees to its cost.\nAnd skiers simply demand more from their resorts than they once did. Gone are the days, says Mr. DesLauriers, when skiers were ''mountaineering types, happy with a bunkhouse and a good spaghetti dinner.'' The high-tech ski lifts and snow-making equipment, the up-scale restaurants, health clubs and other amenities do not come cheap.\nIndustry experts say that ski areas that have not diversified could well find themselves snapped up by others. Those that diversified only into real estate may be particularly vulnerable, as the new tax law makes condominiums less attractive to investors. Indeed, Killington, which gets only 2 percent of total revenues from real estate, ''is looking forward to tremendous acquisition potential'' among competitors reeling in red ink, says David Dillon, director of corporate relations for S-K-I Limited, Killington's parent company.\nA shakeout may not only be inevitable, but may be beneficial. ''With the maturing process comes a purging,'' said Mr. Branch. ''It hurts, but the industry will be stronger for it.''

For the most part, that's good news, since the sight of Congress in action makes a lot of people queasy. Unfortunately, like swallows, or cockroaches, our lawmakers are likely to return. And when they do, they will apply themselves with fierce determination (but with a studied lack of enthusiasm) to the sticky business of untangling the financial details of the Iran-contra arms dealings.\nThe first thing the Congressional committees will discover is that everyone involved lost money. We all know that Iran was gouged mercilessly, and that the Pentagon conveniently sold the weapons out of its stockpiles at wholesale 1976 prices.\nBut the bad luck didn't stop there. Adnan Khashoggi, the billionaire Saudi arms merchant who, it turns out, has the same cash-flow problem as my Uncle Morris, lost a lot of money on the deal. The shadowy Canadians forfeited a small fortune. The Israelis did not make a penny. In this age of avarice, why are so many people suddenly so quick to admit that they were fleeced? We are no longer accustomed to such protestations, and hearing them is, well, spooky. Could this mean that the truth is much worse than we ever imagined? Perhaps this is not, after all, your standard American-Iranian-Israeli-Saudi-Swiss-Nicaraguan-Can-adian-Panamanian cabal.\nAs we try to plumb the depths of this fiscal implausibility, let's assume for clarity's sake that everyone involved in the money trail is lying. Surely, that does not require too great a leap of faith. Then let's approach the mystery not as Congressmen or business people, moralists or dentists, but as investment bankers with emphatically warped sensibilities. Only from this perspective can we possibly understand how the money got from point A to point Z, and why there was so little left at the end of the trip.\nFirst of all, no one ever really believed that the $30 million went straight from Switzerland to Nicaragua. That is not how the world of finance works nowadays. We live in the age of the mortgage-backed zero-coupon interest-rate swap. Even the most legitimate transaction is so complicated that it seems illegal. Besides, our Swiss friends are neither stupid nor magnanimous. Before sending the money on its historic journey, they skimmed 5 percent ($1.5 million) off the top, their standard fee for facilitating global corruption.\nThe money was then sent to the Bahamas, where it was deposited in the account of one of America's finest young financiers, Dennis B. Clean. Because our Government had made an accounting error and was no longer sure if the original $30 million was actually $30 million or just $10 million (small numbers always being a problem for this Administration), it was decided that however much there actually was had to be given to Mr. Clean so he could increase it. Otherwise the Government might look bad.\nSo Mr. Clean traded and the funds multiplied to $45 million. After charging the Government $8 million for his troubles (the typical investment banking fee for any minor service) and swiping another $3 million just because it felt so good, Mr. Clean sent the remaining $34 million to be laundered at a bank in Boston, where it was turned into quarters. AT THAT point, three trucks containing $12 million in change vanished from the face of the earth, an event the bank dismissed as ''a clerical error.'' The only clue investigators found was a Panamanian company called Fenway Resources, which, in a move some considered suspicious, was dissolved 12 seconds after it was created.\nSince the Government considered it foolish to allow so much cash to sit around idly without contributing to the restructuring and disemboweling of corporate America, the loot was transported to the Beverly Hills office of DBL Deal Inc., the prominent investment banking company. DBL then issued some junk bonds for Sir James Goldfleece and Ronald O. Imperilem, which worked out fine, until the two men decided to acquire one another. After they agreed that the only honorable way out of the mess was to have Mr. Imperilem pay greenmail to Mr. Goldfleece - and vice versa - the two raiders shook hands and decided to go after C. Pone Shuckems, the defender of shareholder rights and other lost causes, who was thought to be distracted by his recent acquisition of Guatemala.\nThrough the magic of the junk-bond market, DBL Deal had turned the $22 million into $31 million. The company then deducted $13 million, $8 million for the normal investment banking fee, plus $5 million for meals, thus reducing the stake to $18 million. DBL Deal sent the booty on to a favorite arbitrager Bela Luboesky, but then the malcontents at the S.E.C. intervened.\nA crisis of confidence soon loomed. To make sure the securities markets remained calm, the S.E.C. granted Mr. Luboesky certain concessions and sent him a boxed set of TOW antitank missiles, conditioned upon his promise not to sell the weapons to Iraq or Dennis B. Clean. If Mr. Luboesky wanted to join the contras, of course, arrangements could be made.\nDBL Deal, meanwhile, won Federal Reserve approval to market a new financial instrument, mortgage-backed subpoenas. With the markets temporarily in turmoil, DBL, the S.E.C. and Mr. Luboesky had no choice but to turn the $18 million over to the C.I.A., which deducted the standard fee and gave the remaining $10 million to Sam Hill, a highly regarded investment banker of fortune, to take to the contras. The contra leaders responded by expressing their gratitude and vowing to use the money only for legitimate risk arbitrage. ''We'll make a killing,'' they said.\nThe two Administration officials who allegedly hatched this whole scheme, Vice Adm. John Perplexter and Lieut. Col. Oliver Fifth, are now said by Wall Street sources to be seeking investors for a new securities firm. The contra leaders, clearly men of their time, used bank financing to leverage the $10 million into what he called ''real money.'' He then lost it all on the Gillette deal.\nPrivately, a Reagan Administration official said that the entire affair was an embarrassment, and noted that the nation's return on equity was particularly unsatisfactory. ''I guess,'' he said, ''we learned what a lot of American companies already know - that working with Wall Street can be a very expensive proposition. But when you come right down to it, we, like investment bankers, just love to do deals.'' BUSINESS FORUM: A WALL STREET CONNECTION

Hunt, chief economist for CM&M Group in Philadelphia, and that alone is something to cheer about as the new year begins. For most of 1986, large banks held about $250 billion in short-term commercial and industrial loans, a level that reflected a weak economy. Now, says Mr. Hunt, these loans are approaching the $265 billion level.\nThe rising loan level is good news. When demand for short-term funds rises, it means companies are borrowing money to pay dividends, meet payroll requirements and purchase equipment. ''It is an indicator of business activity and business confidence,'' says Mr. Hunt.\nAnd at least two other factors support the encouraging loan picture. ''There are signs that industrial activity is beginning to pick up, such as the rise in manufacturing employment,'' said Mr. Hunt. And inventory investment, which has undergone a dramatic liquidation since 1984, is also rising. Inventory-building is not only a sign of business confidence, it also spurs more borrowing, he says. ''Typically, increases in inventory investment lead to higher credit demands.'' Foreigners Phone Toll-Free\nAbout 400 companies worldwide offer toll-free calls for customers. ''And the number has been rising by about 20 percent a month,'' said Robert K. Baulch, manager of international marketing for A.T.&T., which sells the global service to about 120 American companies. Right now, phone companies in 15 countries offer international toll-free calling to customers in those nations. By the end of 1987, 10 more countries in Asia, Europe and South America will join that list.\nBut, at $1.60 a call, reaching new customers around the world is not an inexpensive proposition for American companies, even though, according to Mr. Baulch, toll-free service can increase a customer's willingness to call sevenfold. The key industries involved - catalogue, travel and services businesses -will also have to make some changes in the way they do business, he says. Companies, for example, will have to set up operations to receive calls at all hours of the day - in a dozen languages. Shipping From a Tiny Isle\nBecause of new laws and favorable taxation - no corporate tax, no estate duty, no capital gains tax and a mere 20 percent personal income tax - the Isle of Man, off the coast of England in the Irish Sea, is competing with the Netherlands, West Germany and the United States to become a major world shipping center.\nThe isle now has 40 ships registered. But it is not stopping there. ''In the next 12 months there will probably be 100 ships on the registry,'' predicts Capt. Geoffrey Davis, chief marine surveyor for the isle. So far, the Isle of Man has been luring shipping companies from elsewhere in Britain. That's because crews cost 30 percent less to hire on the isle and office expenses are 50 percent lower there. But because registration fees on the isle are also low, shipping companies from other countries may start to set up headquarters on the tiny island. Captain Davis says, however, that unlike Liberia and Panama, the Isle of Man is ''not a flag-of-convenience registry.'' Shipping safety-and-health standards will be high, he says, and rigorously enforced. False Teeth That Fit\nAn estimated 30 million Americans have no teeth in one or both jaws, and about 10 percent of them cannot wear dentures for either physical or psychological reasons, says Craig Rodriguez, vice president of Nobelpharma USA, an American subsidiary of Swedish Nobel Industries.\nNow, he says, some of these people may have something to smile about: a 20-year-old Swedish technique called the Biotes process. The technique, which has the approval of the Food and Drug Administration and the provisional blessing of the American Dental Association, has now been tested on 9,000 Americans.\nThe process uses three screws. The first is surgically screwed into the jawbone. It is made of titanium, and thus integrates with the bone to form ''an irreversible bond,'' said Mr. Rodriguez. A second is screwed on top of the first so that it comes up to the gum line. A third holds the tooth in place. This tooth can be used as an anchor to hold a bridge or a complete denture. The final screw can be removed if the tooth or denture needs to be replaced. The cost of an upper or lower denture created with this process is about $8,000, but, says Mr. Rodriquez, ''it may last 20 years or more.''

The conclusion of this, and every Surgeon General's report that followed, was that smoking is a health hazard of enormous proportions.\nMORE than 20 years ago, an advisory committee to the United States Surgeon General undertook a historic examination of the existing scientific data on tobacco use. The conclusion of this, and every Surgeon General's report that followed, was that smoking is a health hazard of enormous proportions.\nIn the years since the original Surgeon General's report on smoking and health, each major conclusion has been confirmed by subsequent independent research. The disastrous consequences to the smoker in terms of cancer, heart disease and emphysema are now beyond doubt. Cigarette smoking is the single most preventable cause of illness and death in the United States.\nDespite its addictive nature, cigarette smoking has been called a ''chosen risk,'' and more than 30 million Americans have quit smoking in the last 20 years, deciding that such a risk is unacceptable. On the other hand, roughly 53 million Americans continue to smoke, despite overwhelming evidence about its dangers.\nToday, the personal risk of illness and death from tobacco use must be viewed within the larger context of a moral issue that looms before this nation and the world. Cigarette smoking can no longer be viewed as a personal decision. We now know that smokers impose their ''chosen risk'' on millions of others who must involuntarily inhale the toxic components of burning cigarettes. Stated quite simply: You need not smoke cigarettes to be harmed by them.\nWe have reached a critical point in the history of the social phemomenon of smoking tobacco. Two new reports, each examining the health risk of involuntary smoking, should contribute to a change in public policy perhaps as far-reaching as the changes in private behavior caused by the first Surgeon General's report. LAST November, the National Academy of Sciences issued the result of a year-long examination of the scientific evidence on the health effects of involuntary smoking. One month later, the most recent report of the Surgeon General reviewed in depth the consequences of involuntary tobacco exposure. These independent reports reached a number of similar conclusions that include these:\n* Involuntary smoking is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in non-smokers. The Surgeon General's report concluded that ''it is certain'' that a substantial portion of the lung cancers that occur in non-smokers are due to exposure to tobacco smoke. Given the size of the population involuntarily exposed to smoke, a significant number of us are at risk. Indeed, the Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, has estimated that involuntary smoking causes more deaths than all other airborne pollutants combined, with the single exception of asbestos. One recent study by the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that from 500 to 5,000 non-smokers in America die each year from lung cancer caused by others' cigarettes.\n* Infants and children exposed to tobacco smoke in the home have an increased incidence of serious respiratory illnesses. Asthma is more common among youngsters whose parents smoke. Children breathing the cigarette smoke of their parents have several times the usual number of respiratory infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia.\n* Healthy non-smokers exposed to tobacco smoke experience acute physical reactions, including eye, nose and throat irritation. We know that much of the American population is allergic to cigarette smoke. The symptoms reported by non-smokers include burning, itching and tearing eyes, headaches, sore throats and hoarseness and other allergic reactions.\n* The simple separation of smokers and non-smokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Non-smokers are quite likely to have no choice about breathing tobacco smoke. This takes on new importance because we know that the non-smoker can be exposed to several thousand chemical constituents in sidestream smoke, more than four dozen of which are known to cause cancer.\nIn my opinion, the scientific evidence gained thus far about involuntary smoking is substantial and great cause for alarm. Smoking can no longer be excused as a ''chosen risk,'' but now must be viewed as one person's choice and another's unwanted danger. The evidence is now sufficient to declare that a smoker's rights end at the tip of the non-smokers nose. As the Surgeon General concluded, ''the right of smokers to smoke ends where their behavior affects the health and well-being of others.''\nProtecting the public from the dangers of passive smoking requires urgent action. The only certain way to make indoor air safe from cigarettes is to eliminate the source.\nBUSINESS FORUM: ATTACK ON 'PASSIVE' SMOKING

It would take a marathon eating session of more than 17 - or more than 400 continuous hours at a table - to be exposed to the nicotine ''equivalent'' of a cigarette at a typical New York City restaurant. These scientific findings were based on actual test results from 47 office sites and 48 dining establishments.\nItem: Since 1981, ACVA Atlantic Inc., a Fairfax, Va., company that analyzes indoor air quality, has investigated 125 cases of ''sick building syndrome,'' where office air was suspected of harming the health of employees. Of these cases, only five, or 4 percent, were linked even in part to cigarette smoke in the air, which is known to scientists as environmental tobacco smoke. In another study of 203 buildings suspected of sick-building syndrome, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration found that only four buildings (2 percent) had indoor air quality problems attributable to cigarette smoke. Both investigations noted, however, that tobacco smoke - the only indoor factor visible to the naked eye - was suspected as the culprit by occupants of most of the buildings.\nItem: Three major international scientific conferences, involving more than 50 eminent scientists, have concluded within the past five years that there is no persuasive evidence that environmental tobacco smoke poses a significant health risk to non-smokers. Even Surgeon General C. Everett Koop admitted in December that more than half of the 16 studies exploring environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer in non-smokers have found no consistent, statistically significant relationship.\nDr. Koop, who acknowledges he would like to see cigarettes banned, is the point man in the anti-smoking lobby's efforts to achieve a ''smoke-free society by the year 2000.'' Dr. Koop has said that the only way this goal will be reached is through piecemeal prohibition - primarily a crazy-quilt patchwork of legislated restrictions and bans in individual cities, counties and states.\nAnd Dr. Koop is taking no chances in seeing to it that the anti-smoking laws get on the books. To do so, this nation's primary health officer has abused his position, placing his political agenda above scientific integrity. No previous Surgeon General has exploited his office in such a blatantly propagandistic manner. A comparable example might have been if Carrie Nation, in the years before Prohibition, served as Surgeon General and issued a ''scientific'' report providing the political ammunition to secure passage of the 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act. THE recently released Surgeon\nGeneral's report on so-called ''involuntary smoking'' is at odds on key points with a study released in November by the National Academy of Sciences. While the academy's panel expressed concern about the possible effect of smoking in the home, it acknowledged that available scientific evidence does not show that smoking on the job or in public places, such as restaurants, jeopardizes the health of non-smokers.\nBut the academy's findings do nothing to advance the Surgeon General's political agenda, since laws are not going to be passed restricting smoking in the home, backyards and private automobiles. Not surprisingly, therefore, when the Surgeon General reviewed precisely the same body of evidence, he came away with the opposite conclusion: Smoking on the job and in public places does jeopardize the health of non-smokers. Dr. Koop apparently realized that without this conclusion, no laws would be passed to further his quest for a smoke-free society.\nThe Surgeon General is not alone in subverting science to politics when it comes to environmental tobacco smoke. It is no exaggeration to say that these efforts to alarm non-smokers and force the hand of lawmakers have brought scientific integrity to a crossroads. The pressure from forces dedicated to the prohibition of cigarette smoking is intense. Thus, it will be no small feat for scientists and health experts to discuss the issue with complete objectivity.\nRecent episodes illustrate the kinds of pressure being exerted. One involved a medical education conference at a major university medical center on the health effects of tobacco smoke on non-smokers, funded in part by tobacco companies It was canceled after sustained pressure from anti-smoking activists and organizations, including the United States Office on Smoking and Health, which is headed by Dr. Koop. Following a barrage of calls and letters, several scientists withdrew from the conference at the last moment, forcing cancellation of the session.\nAnother recent incident of intimidation involved a professor at a major state university who dared suggest that harm to non-smokers from environmental tobacco smoke has not been proved. His university was threatened by the state's health commissioner with loss of research funding.\nIt is telling, indeed, that anti-smokers must resort to these extremes to disguise the fact that proof of harm to non-smokers from passive smoking remains as wispy as cigarette smoke itself.\nBUSINESS FORUM: ATTACK ON 'PASSIVE' SMOKING
700	Exlpaining the Allure of the Clones	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DE1038F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: IN continuing my overview of PC clones, to which the last two columns have been devoted, I would like to remind readers that while these computers have all made their mark by virtue of the relatively low price tags they carry, each one has something a little different to offer the buyer. Therefore, choosing a clone becomes almost as much a matter of preference in, say, keyboards, video display or physical specifications as in the pocketbook.\nIN continuing my overview of PC clones, to which the last two columns have been devoted, I would like to remind readers that while these computers have all made their mark by virtue of the relatively low price tags they carry, each one has something a little different to offer the buyer. Therefore, choosing a clone becomes almost as much a matter of preference in, say, keyboards, video display or physical specifications as in the pocketbook.\nThe Hewlett-Packard Vectra 45 ($4,874 with a 20-megabyte hard disk from Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, Calif. 94303, (415) 857-1500), discussed last week as probably the most solidly engineered of the clones, is also notable for offering the benefit - or, to some individuals, the drawback - of PAM. The acronym stands for Personal Applications Manager, a software shell shielding the user from the vagaries of MS-DOS, the computer's operating system.\nInstead of encountering the vacuous, and justifiably infamous, A G or C G prompt, when starting up the Vectra, one is greeted with a number of menu bars listing the applications programs stored on the hard disk -for example, WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, MindMaster and so on. At the bottom of the screen appear eight light squares representing the Vectra's ''soft,'' or special function, keys designed to augment the F1 through F10 keys.\nThese soft keys are user definable. They can be set so that the first is Start Application, say, the second is the Help key, and the rest set to perform other functions designed to aid the person running the software. To begin working with a particular program, then, the user simply moves the cursor in place over the desired menu choice and presses the first soft key. The chosen program is loaded forthwith, ready to be used.\nThe Vectra's PAM approach can be quite useful in an office situation where, as so often happens, one employee is a computer enthusiast while the others are interested simply in getting the job done without necessarily understanding how the machine goes about its tasks. PAM can be configured to each individual's specific applications needs by the maven, and the separate users need not worry about what went into the tailoring.\nThe usual caution with regard to clones holds: Make sure the software you want to use runs on the machine. But that caveat heeded, the Vectra is well worth looking at for many reasons, one of the most notable, albeit not mentioned till last, being the quality of its monitor. Lacking in resolution - as are, in my opinion, all personal computer monitors - it nonetheless offers one of the crispest and clearest color displays of any personal computer on the market.\nAlthough personal computer sales picked up in 1986 from their former doldrums, there are still a lot of companies whose destiny prognosticators equate with that of the old Studebaker. That ill-fated vehicle had a lot going for it, but not enough to enable it to survive the changing fortunes of Detroit and the consolidation of the auto companies.\nThe survival factor is a question in many personal computer buyers' minds, and rightfully so. But it is also a factor somewhat less important in the choice of a clone than in the selection of other electronic equipment. The fact is that within the variously designed consoles resides a fairly standard and mutually substitutable assortment of components. So interchangeable are these parts that many savings-conscious purchasers will acquire a bare-bones clone and add to it the particular graphics card, disk drive or hard disk they prefer - sometimes at a cost lower than the manufacturer of the clone would have charged for his own version of the components. THE ''I can replace it wholesale if I need to'' mentality currently coming into vogue in the computer marketplace may be particularly important to have if one is considering the purchase of a Tandon PCA ($3,725 with a 40-megabyte hard disk from the Tandon Corporation, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311, (800) 556-1234). Where the otherwise exotic-sounding Hewlett-Packard and Epson are well known among personal computer aficionados, Tandon is less than a household name even among this select group of established users.\nMost people have heard of Tandon, if they have heard of it at all, through news of the company's financial woes or through having seen its stock drop from a high of 35 to a tenth of that price. Yet Tandon remains one of the largest manufacturers of those key computer components, disk drives, many of which can be found in the I.B.M. PC itself.\nTandon's personal computers, only recently introduced in the United States, have already become some of the best-selling machines in Europe where they have been available for a little more than a year. With that in mind, and considering that a company cognizant of its problems may well have a better chance of survival than its less informed competitors when the inevitable debacle befalls the doppelgangers in 1987, a closer look at the Tandon PCA, one of the least expensive of the AT clones available, is well worth the time spent on it by any prospective personal computer purchaser.\nThe PCA is nearly identical to the I.B.M. PC-AT, but it offers in addition a dual 6- and 8-megahertz speed - one toggles back and forth between the two modes by pressing the Control, Alt and slash keys simultaneously -to allow users to run their software at higher speeds wherever that is possible. The keyboard looks the same as that of the original AT, but it does not have quite as good a feel. It does, however, lack the clickety-clack of the original.\nSo far does the PCA go in copying its I.B.M. mentor that it comes complete with obscure and excruciating manuals just as the original does. They are really no worse than the industry standard, but given the fact that many buyers of the clones are first-timers stepping into the world of electronic data processing because plunging prices have made that move irresistible, the instructional arena seems an unfortunate place for computer companies to cut corners. To its credit, on the other hand, Tandon has included a menu-driven program to help users in formatting its hard disk - certainly a step in the right direction.\nIf the Tandon PCA differs very little from I.B.M.'s AT except in its label and console, its price is dramatically lower. What's more, that price will no doubt be discounted even further by aggressive dealers. And price is the main reason why buyers are looking at clones in the first place.\nTHE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER

Arnone, a benefits consultant in the Los Angeles office of Buck Consultants Inc., an employee benefits consulting firm. ''The temptation is to fiddle around with it, and to cut scheduled payroll tax increases prematurely. I think that would be a real mistake.''\nNo legislation is pending, but in recent months a number of politicians of both parties, including such Presidential hopefuls as Pierre S. du Pont 4th, the former Republican Governor of Delaware, and Representative Jack Kemp, Republican of New York, have urged various reforms to reduce the burden of the payroll tax.\nFor 1987, the wage base, or amount of income on which the FICA (for Federal Insurance Contributions Act) tax is imposed, will rise to $43,800 from $42,000. The tax rate will remain at last year's level: 7.15 percent for employees, equally matched by employers, and 12.3 percent for self-employed individuals. The maximum FICA tax that an employee will pay in 1987 will be $3,131.70, up from $3,003 in 1986. The self-employed will pay a maximum of $5,387.40, compared to $5,166 last year.\nIn 1988, the FICA tax rate for employees is scheduled to rise to 7.51 percent, equally matched by employers, on a projected wage base of $45,300. For the self-employed, the rate will go to 13.02 percent on the same projected wage base. In 1990, the rate for employees will rise to 7.65 percent, on a projected wage base of $50,100. The rate for the self-employed will soar to 15.3 percent on the same base, although a new system of deductions will make the burden less onerous.\nThe scheduled increases are part of a long history of increasing both the tax rate and the wage base. Two decades ago, in 1966, the wage ceiling was $6,600; the employee rate was 4.2 percent and the self-employed rate was 6.15 percent. In the past 10 years, there have been six increases in the FICA tax rate. Although income tax rates have dropped dramatically during that time, the concurrent rise in FICA tax has meant that disposable income for many individuals has not increased at all. ''We've achieved an undesirable parity between income tax and Social Security tax,'' says Avery E. Neumark, an employee benefits consultant with the accounting firm of Ernst & Whinney.\nOn the other side of the ledger, benefits to retirees and others will inch up by 1.3 percent starting with the checks they receive in January. This modest cost-of-living increase, reflecting the 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index, will mean, for example, that retired workers on average will see their monthly checks go to $488 from $482; workers who retired at age 65 last year and qualified for the top benefit of $760 will see their checks go to $769. THE change that will affect the most people, however, is that retirees will have to pay a higher portion of their medical costs. Under changes in Part A of Medicare, which covers hospital costs, the deductible for in-patient hospital expenses, the portion of those expenses paid for by the patients themselves, will rise to $520 from $492. In addition, the amount of daily co-insurance, or the amount of daily expenses that patients must pay, will go to $130 from $123 for the 61st to 90th days of hospitalization, and to $65 from $61.50 for the 21st to 100th days of post-hospital care in a skilled-nursing facility.\nThe major change in Part B of Medicare, which provides optional insurance that covers doctors' bills and surgeons' fees, is an increase in the monthly premium. The charge for the coverage will rise to $17.90 from $15.50, lifting the annual cost of the protection to $214.80, from $186 last year.\nEven greater changes in Part B were proposed last month by Dr. Otis R. Bowen, Secretary of Health and Human Services. He suggested expanding Medicare to cover catastrophic medical expenses, but President Reagan's top economic adviser, Beryl W. Sprinkel, opposed the idea, maintaining that the plan would replace a competitive private market with a Government monopoly. The President may make recommendations in his State of the Union message this month. In any event, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Massachusetts Democrat and long a supporter of national health insurance, praised Dr. Bowen's plan and said he would introduce a version in Congress.\nRegardless of how the debate over the merits of expanding Medicare is resolved, some observers have doubts about the adequacy of the Medicare portion of the FICA tax to fund the medical costs of the existing program beyond the next few years. ''Various projections have been made that indicate Medicare may prove to be insufficient by 1990,'' says Thomas H. Paine, partner in the New York office of Hewitt Associates, an employee benefits consulting firm. ''I think it's very likely.'' The current 7.15 FICA payroll tax has two components, he notes: 5.7 percent is for Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance, while 1.45 percent is for Medicare. ''We're talking about another half a percentage point to fix it,'' he says. ''But so far Congress hasn't felt it was needed.'' TAX HELP FOR THE INJURED\nThe efforts of a New York City teacher who was injured while he tried to protect his students from an intruder wielding an iron pipe did not go unrewarded by the Internal Revenue Service. The teacher suffered severe back and leg injuries in the attack. After an examination for the New York Board of Education, physicians gave the teacher a certification permitting him to receive his normal salary under Board of Education regulations.\nWhile sickness and accident benefits are generally taxable to an employee if they are paid by the employer, compensation received under a workers' compensation act is generally exempt. The question was whether the salary the teacher received after being injured was subject to tax.\nThe Research Institute of America, a tax publishing service, reports that the I.R.S. recently held that the teacher's salary was tax-exempt because the Board of Education regulations were tantamount to a workers' compensation act. The decision came as a private letter ruling, which applies only to this particular case. Nonetheless, such rulings are widely followed as an indication of the current I.R.S. position on an issue.\nPERSONAL FINANCE

That decision was put off with a March 15 deadline for again considering such unpopular proposals as a new property tax on motor vehicles.\nEnding a 19-day special session that occasionally erupted in shouts, Democrats won a grudging surrender from suburban and upstate Republicans by agreeing to increase spending on highways and provide direct state aid to commuter rail lines. The vote, 80 to 36 in the Assembly and 38 to 7 in the Senate, held the transit fare at $1 and also averted fare increases for riders of the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North.\nAssuming the $735 million is found on schedule, the freeze will last through 1989. Tolls on East River bridges and tunnels will go up 25 cents, to $2, early this year and 25 cents every two years thereafter.\nThe chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Robert R. Kiley, called it ''a great day for straphangers and for people in the region.'' But Assemblyman Stephen M. Saland, a Poughkeepsie Republican, warned that fellow upstaters who supported the agreement would ''rue the day.'' And Assemblyman Frederick D. Schmidt of Woodhaven, Queens, who voted for the bill, was cheered when he declared: ''The service is absolutely terrible. If they don't get their act together, they can expect no support from me.''

Manes, a powerful, popular and ambitious politician, walked out of Queens Borough Hall and into that special rogues' gallery of men who have robbed New York.\nONE year ago this Friday, Donald R. Manes, a powerful, popular and ambitious politician, walked out of Queens Borough Hall and into that special rogues' gallery of men who have robbed New York.\nMr. Manes, then the borough president, left his office early on the evening of Jan. 9, got into a city car and drove into the night. Nine hours later he was found in the car near Shea Stadium, dazed and bleeding from wounds on his wrist and leg.\nThe initial mystery was soon solved. He had tried to kill himself, and later did kill himself, after learning that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had discovered his role in a bribery ring that included other political leaders and present and former city officials.\nThat disclosure has confronted New Yorkers with even bigger and still far from fully answered questions. How wide and how deep was the corruption? And who else was involved?\nGraft, of course, is nothing new. In New York City government, it goes back even before the time in 1861 when P.T. Barnum bribed the aldermen to let him pump saltwater from the bay for his whales to swim in.\nWhether the current scandals are the worst since Boss Tweed's exposure in the 1870's, as some have said, is still a matter of debate: Mayor Koch has sought to soften the blow to his administration by rattling off lists of previous episodes, including the time when bodies were sold from the morgue under the administration of that icon of New York mayors, Fiorello H. La Guardia.\nBut a great deal has been learned this past year about the underside of New York's government. Here is a review of some of it. THE 'MARKETPLACE'\nSince Jan. 9, 11 men have been convicted or have pleaded guilty to charges related to the scandal. A 12th, the former head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, was acquitted of governmental corruption charges but convicted of personal wrongdoing and of lying on city disclosure forms. At least nine other people have been granted immunity in exchange for their testimony. Fourteen others, including two judges and the former taxi and transportation commissioners, are under indictment and awaiting trial.\nThe cases are not all directly related, but taken together they have provided an insider's view of what one defense attorney described as the ''municipal marketplace'' -an Oriental bazaar where politics, government and business intersect, where influence is bought and sold and where the line between a consulting fee and a bribe is not always easy to discern. EARLY WARNINGS\nIn retrospect, there were clues long before the scandals broke. Alex Liberman, a loyal member of the Brooklyn Democratic organization who became the man in charge of negotiating city leases, pleaded guilty in 1984 to taking more than $1 million in bribes from landlords. Questions about his integrity had been raised twice before, but each time he had simply been moved to another job.\nIn 1982 James Rose, comptroller of the Parking Violations Bureau, complained about corruption in the bureau. He went to his superiors, to the Inspector General of the Transportation Department and to the Department of Investigation. But his information, along with the later testimony of a police officer and another parking bureau official, was shunted from file to file and ultimately forgotten.\nIn 1984 James Smith, a Brooklyn weekly newspaper editor, asked Mayor Koch during a City Club luncheon why the city was making Stanley M. Friedman, the Bronx Democratic leader, ''a millionaire'' by awarding a contract to Citisource, a firm in which Mr. Friedman held stock. Mr. Koch brushed the question aside, challenging Mr. Smith to show evidence of a crime.\nIn 1985 Justice William C. Brennan of Queens Supreme Court was convicted of taking bribes from organized crime figures to fix cases in Queens. Elected to the court in 1969, he had long been active in borough politics and was a close friend and frequent luncheon companion of Presiding Justice Francis X. Smith, who is now under indictment for perjury in a separate case. THE STING\nThe scandals came at a time when many New Yorkers, buoyed by boom times, had come to believe that their city, for all its economic and social divisions, was at least a relatively honest place. Sure, a building inspector might take a bribe, they thought, but this was not Chicago. It is thus particularly ironic that the corruption in New York came to light because a corrupt New York businessman, Bernard Sandow, tried to expand to Chicago and got caught.\nThe man who triggered the crisis is a burly bunco racketeer and professional informer. He was born in Brooklyn 57 years ago as Michael Raymond, but his alias for the last few years has been Michael Burnett. Paroled from prison at the end of 1983, he got a job as marketing director for a New York City collection agency, Systematic Recovery Services, whose president was Mr. Sandow.\nMr. Sandow wanted to use in Chicago the technique that was working so well in New York: bribing public officials. Mr. Burnett took on the job, but unbeknownst to Mr. Sandow, Mr. Burnett by then had become an informant for the F.B.I. From an apartment on Chicago's Gold Coast, Mr. Burnett began gathering evidence against corrupt Chicago officials - and against Mr. Sandow.\nOn Nov. 26, 1985, Mr. Burnett, wearing an electronic recording device, attended a luncheon at Hisae's Restaurant, near Cooper Union in the East Village. The other guests were Mr. Sandow and Geoffrey G. Lindenauer, the portly deputy director of New York City's Parking Violations Bureau.\nThe men talked about politics. They talked about losing weight. Most of all they talked about bribing the director of the Parking Violations Bureau, Lester N. Shafran, with cash, goods and women. At one point Mr. Sandow accompanied Mr. Lindenauer to the men's room and gave him $5,000.\nConfronted a month later, Mr. Sandow agreed to become an informer, too. Between them, Mr. Sandow and Mr. Burnett supplied the information to the F.B.I. that persuaded Mr. Lindenauer to turn on the other members of the bribery ring and testify for the Government. THE RING\nAt the heart of the scandals was the revelation that Parking Violations Bureau contracts had been bought and sold by a ring of corrupt officials.\nTo improve the collection rate, the P.V.B. had started farming out overdue fines to private agencies - sometimes already established, sometimes created for the purpose -that were allowed to keep a cut, up to 40 percent of the millions of dollars they collected.\nThey would also, it emerged, turn over a cut to ring members, who included:\nMr. Manes, the Queens Democratic leader, who was sworn in for a fourth term as borough president two days before his first suicide attempt. The parking bureau had become known as ''a Queens operation,'' with appointees loyal not to Mayor Koch but to Mr. Manes, who had bragged about how much money he would make in bribes if he succeeded in becoming mayor himself. On March 13 Mr. Manes died after driving a knife into his heart. He was never charged with a crime, but was named a co-racketeer in indictments issued after his death.\nMr. Friedman, who became the Bronx Democratic leader with Mayor Koch's help after serving as Deputy Mayor and patronage chief in the administration of Abraham D. Beame. A sign that hung in Mr. Friedman's City Hall office declared, ''Crime Doesn't Pay - as Well as Politics.'' His party post allowed him to continue practicing law, and his clients included collection agencies and a company named Citisource.\nCitisource paid Mr. Friedman in stock, making him its largest stockholder, and the value of his holdings soared when Mr. Friedman won the company a contract to make portable computers for the P.V.B.\nIn November he was convicted of acting as a broker for bribes to Mr. Manes and other officials to win their help in obtaining contracts for Citisource and other firms including Datacom, a collection agency and computer service company.\nMichael J. Lazar, a former City Councilman, chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission and Transportation Administrator, the man who initiated the use of private collection agencies at the parking bureau under Mr. Beame.\nAfter leaving city government he became a private real estate developer and also worked for Datacom. He was convicted of paying bribes on behalf of Datacom.\nMr. Shafran, a protege of Mr. Lazar who became director of the P.V.B. soon after Mr. Koch became Mayor in 1978. Mr. Shafran was convicted of taking bribes from contractors.\nMarvin B. Kaplan, chairman of Citisource, who was convicted of arranging a bribe of Citisource stock that Mr. Friedman held on behalf of Mr. Manes and Mr. Lindenauer.\nMr. Lindenauer, the deputy director of the P.V.B. and a longtime friend of Mr. Manes, who got him his job. Mr. Lindenauer pleaded guilty to collecting some $400,000 in bribes from contractors and splitting the money with Mr. Manes. He also said he lied to other city officials so that Citisource would be given the contract to produce portable computers. His testimony in Federal Court was crucial to the conviction in November of Messrs. Friedman, Lazar, Shafran and Kaplan. Mr. Lindenauer's sentencing has been postponed while he continues to cooperate with Government lawyers. CLOSE LINKS\nNot part of the ring, but tied either to Mr. Manes or to the parking bureau and currently under indictment:\nRichard L. Rubin, a longtime associate of Mr. Manes who was the secretary to the Queens Democratic organization. He was indicted for inducing two Queens Assemblymen to put secretaries working for his law firm on their payrolls.\nAnthony R. Ameruso, a Beame administration official, promoted to Transportation Commissioner by Mayor Koch in 1978 on the recommendation of Brooklyn political leaders but over the objections of the Mayor's own screening committee. Mr. Ameruso has not been charged in relation to the bribery ring, although the parking bureau was under his supervision. But he resigned as commissioner and has been charged with perjury for concealing an investment related to a firm to which he awarded a ferry permit.\nJohn A. Zaccaro, a real estate and insurance broker and the husband of former Representative Geraldine Ferraro. He was indicted for acting ''in concert'' with Mr. Manes in attempting to extort money from a company seeking a franchise to install cable television.\nAlso indicted were Justice Smith, who is accused of lying about meetings he attended with Mr. Zaccaro, and Michael Nussbaum, a political aide to Mr. Manes, indicted for soliciting a bribe from a cable company on Mr. Manes's behalf. OTHER CASES\nIndicted as a result of separate investigations:\nJay L. Turoff, who was named chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission on the next to last day of the Beame administration on the recommendation of the Brooklyn Democratic organization and was later reappointed by Mayor Koch. He resigned abruptly in March, in the midst of investigations that are still continuing, and was indicted in June for accepting a $30,000 bribe from the manufacturer of a taxi meter that the commission ordered drivers to buy.\nMr. Turoff arranged unsecured financing for the meter company, Electronic Compumeter, through a politically connected Brooklyn credit union, Hyfin (an acronym for Help Your Friend in Need). Three friends of Mr. Turoff who helped organize Compumeter have been indicted with him and will go on trial next month.\nA Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice, Jerome Cohen, has been charged with accepting interest-free loans from Hyfin in exchange for children's trust fund accounts. Hyfin's secretary-treasurer, Edmund Lee, and two other executives have pleaded guilty to fraud charges and the credit union has been dissolved.\nJohn J. McLaughlin, who resigned as president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation while under investigation in August 1985. He was indicted later that year for stealing from an elderly heiress whose funds had been placed in his trust.\nLast April, after the start of the city scandals but before his trial, he was charged with using the trust fund to launder a bribe from a company doing business with the hospitals corporation. He was acquitted on that charge but convicted of falsely billing travel expenses to the trust fund and lying on city disclosure forms. He was sentenced to six months in prison. YET TO COME\nFederal and local prosecutors say their work is far from over.\nIn the Bronx: The United States Attorney in Manhattan, Rudolph W. Giuliani, is cooperating with the Bronx District Attorney, Mario Merola, in an inquiry into allegations of political abuse. Included are reports that Bronx businessmen were pressured for contributions to the campaign fund of Stanley Simon, the Bronx borough president, in exchange for economic development aid.\nAlso under investigation are consulting fees paid to Mr. Friedman and some of his political associates by Cablevision, the firm that holds the cable television franchise in the Bronx.\nAnd the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, has joined Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Merola in an investigation of Wedtech, a Bronx defense contractor that may have defrauded the Government.\nIn Brooklyn: The Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman, is investigating the award of cable television franchises and allegations that millions of dollars in bribes have been paid to Board of Education building inspectors to approve shoddy work.\nFederal Government officials are looking at the activities of the retired leader of the Brooklyn political organization, Meade H. Esposito, and are investigating a charge that Carl A. Capasso, a construction contractor who is close to several ranking members of the Koch administration, paid kickbacks to obtain a contract to build a sewage treatment plant.\nTHE REGION

Casey is in stable condition, fully conscious and ''sitting up periodically,'' Georgetown University Hospital reiterated last week. But doubts about his condition persisted, and many questions remained unanswered. The hospital had given the same brief condition report several days after Mr. Casey underwent surgery for removal of a brain tumor Dec. 18.\nThe lack of specifics, and apparently of any improvement in the condition of the 73-year-old Director of Central Intelligence, prompted speculation that he was not recovering well and might be unable to walk or speak. President Reagan has not talked to Mr. Casey, a close and trusted adviser, since the operation, according to the White House spokesman, Larry Speakes. Mr. Speakes said he did not feel ''it was appropriate at this stage'' to explain why. (Mr. Reagan himself was was scheduled to enter Bethesda Naval Hospital today for a routine follow-up check for colon cancer and for prostate surgery. ''What I'm going in for is kind of a breeze,'' he said.) Last week in Palm Springs, Calif., where the Reagans were taking a New Year's holiday, Mr. Speakes also told reporters Nancy Reagan had ''called Mrs. Casey to wish her a happy New Year and ask about her husband's situation and so forth.'' Under a barrage of questions, he said repeatedly that he did not know what Sophia Casey had replied.\nMr. Speakes denied reports that the White House had drawn up a list of possible successors in case the Director was unable to return to work.\nMr. Casey's ability to recover will depend on several factors that were not disclosed by the hospital, such as his condition before the operation, the precise location of the lymphoma and the areas of the brain that surgeons had to cut to reach it. The tumor could have damaged Mr. Casey's intellectual capacities in the last few months, or even years, but he may also have escaped any impairment. In any case, he must still undergo radiation treatment and possibly chemotherapy, making his return unlikely for some time.\nMr. Casey suffered seizures that led to discovery of the tumor just hours before he was to testify before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which was investigating the secret Reagan Administration program to sell arms to Iran and to use profits from the sale to benefit Nicaraguan rebels. Mr. Casey had said previously that the intelligence agency acted as a ''facilitator'' for the arms sales but that he had not known where the money was going.\nTHE NATION

The police arrested only a handful, despite a warning that the protesters would be ''severely punished.'' Several were released hours later.\nNonetheless, there were growing signs that the conciliatory stance toward the students is eroding. Communist Party hard-liners, whose names usually appear only in connection with minor Government matters, were quoted in the press as saying that the calls for freedom are an unhealthy attempt to impose ''all-out Westernization.'' Taiwan was accused of mobilizing ''secret agents'' to incite the students.\nSome Western diplomats said that the conservatives might use the upheaval to muster resistance to the reforms of Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader.

Most politicians would have. Not Ed Koch. ''But you still like me, right?'' Pause. ''What's not to like?'' came the answer. ''But. . . .'' The Mayor, laughing, interrupted. ''I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead.'' Click.\nThe incident demonstrated, as have so many others in the last 12 months, that 1986 was the year Ed Koch lost his political innocence. It was a year in which the Mayor, seemingly invulnerable after his 78 percent re-election victory just the year before, found himself conceding error, apologizing, explaining, fighting off the lame-duck label by talking about running for a fourth term in 1989.\nIn a particularly damaging admission, the 62-year-old Mr. Koch confessed to poor judgment and naivete in dealing with the city's political leaders. He has had to accept policies he once opposed, to adopt procedures he once criticized, to concede that he is a less accomplished manager than he predicted in his 1977 campaign slogan, ''After eight years of charisma and four years of the clubhouse, why not try competence?''\nNo allegations of corruption have touched Mr. Koch's inner circle, but more than 20 top officials have left over the year, some because of the scandals and some not. The government has been slowed; the Mayor has, he acknowledges, lost some ground.\nBut at City Hall, where trying to assess Mr. Koch's status is an abiding obsession, he is given high marks for resilience. Few are willing to count him out. ''Oh he's been damaged,'' said Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden. ''But not enough to make it interesting.''\n''Koch didn't get elected because he's a good manager,'' said Edward N. Costikyan, the lawyer who wrote ''Behind Closed Doors,'' a handbook of city politics. ''He didn't get elected because he's particularly well organized. He's an ebullient person, and in this era people don't decide about politicians on the basis of fact, they decide on the basis of image and personality. He keeps doing what he always did. That's the key.''\nDoing what he has always done, the Mayor has, since January, made international headlines by telling a group of visiting Soviet youngsters that their government is ''the pits''; complained at a news conference right after the Fourth of July celebration that he had been ignored; and gone out of town repeatedly, even as the scandals were at their height, to promote his second book, ''Politics.'' And it was toward the end of the year of the scandals that Mr. Koch went out to a church in Howard Beach to confront angry white residents who accused him of smearing their community after a black man was killed there in a racial attack. All were classic Koch moves.\nWhat has become increasingly evident is that his political survival will turn on whether the public still wants basically the same man they have been electing and re-electing since 1977. Board of Education President Robert F. Wagner Jr., a friend, put it this way: ''Is he more cautious and less trusting now? Yes. Has he changed fundamentally? No.''\nIt has always been one of Mr. Koch's weaknesses that he embraces people who say they like him. It is unclear whether that has changed, but very clear that it must. He befriended political leaders later implicated in the scandals, sending a message of acceptability that might have made corruption in his government easier. Close to Party Leaders\nMr. Koch has repeatedly insisted that he allowed himself to get close to the kind of party leader he once fought because he needed help to get Federal loan guarantees early in his first term and felt that he had to dispel the notion that he was a maverick, unable to forge a coalition. But others have argued that the Mayor was motivated by self-interest. They point out that the former maverick ultimately got the support of nearly all the regular Democratic leaders in his campaigns.\nIf he runs for a fourth term, he may well have to re-establish his image by running against the Democratic bosses, as former Mayor Robert F. Wagner did when he campaigned successfully for his third term in 1961.\nThe more immediate problem for Mr. Koch and the city is whether the scandals, which have taken on a tenacious life of their own, will impede the Mayor's ability to govern. So far the impact, beyond slowing things down, has been difficult to measure. It seems at times that the Mayor has lost some clout, that he cannot cajole officials the way he used to. He has deferred or withdrawn some issues within the purview of the Board of Estimate because they were controversial or did not have unanimous support. He has accepted compromises from City Council leaders that he might have avoided a year ago.\nAt the same time, the Mayor has some of what he calls ''heavy lifts'' under way, such as installing water meters in residential buildings. And there is no evidence at all that either the public or the leaders of the powerful financial community have lost confidence in him.\n''If the scandal dominates the second year of his third term, then I think he's going to have big problems,'' said City Council President Andrew J. Stein, a potential candidate for Mr. Koch's job. ''If it becomes peripheral and he can make substantive improvements in services, I think he can look strong. It's a big question mark. I don't think anybody, including the Mayor, knows the answer.'' THE REGION
709	Are College Loans Leaving Students In Too Much Debt?	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DC1038F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: When Congress started the Guaranteed Student Loan program in 1965, it considered it a convenience for middle-class families ineligible for other aid. It has since become a hallowed institution and, for many, a way of life.\nWhen Congress started the Guaranteed Student Loan program in 1965, it considered it a convenience for middle-class families ineligible for other aid. It has since become a hallowed institution and, for many, a way of life.\nWith rising college costs and fewer grants, students owed $9.8 billion last year under various Federal programs, almost triple the figure of a decade ago. During the same period, Federal grants and scholarships declined by 62 percent.\nThe Government says Guaranteed Student Loans now cost it $2 billion a year in interest subsidies and $1 billion in defaults.\nThese developments have stirred fears that the nation is creating a generation of overburdened debtors. According to a report released last week by Congress's Joint Economic Committee, a third to a half of all undergraduates leave college owing an average of more than $6,800. Students at graduate and professional schools often accumulate debts of five figures.\nSome critics worry that borrowers will be forced to postpone marriage, children, mortgages and further education, or shun low-paying professions like social work. Others are concerned that the specter of spending 10 years paying for college is discouraging minority enrollment.\nWhile the report found little evidence of serious repercussions, it advised more study and raised the possibility of overhauling the system. Meanwhile, the Administration announced that it would seek to expand a pilot program that eliminates subsidized interest rates but provides more flexible repayment terms.\nIDEAS & TRENDS
710	FOR MENTALLY ILL, LIFE ON STREETS IS NO BOOM	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC1038F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THE population of state and county mental hospitals has plunged 79 percent in the three decades since advocates of community care began demanding that patients be released from big institutional ''warehouses.''\nTHE population of state and county mental hospitals has plunged 79 percent in the three decades since advocates of community care began demanding that patients be released from big institutional ''warehouses.''\nThat is a major reason why there is much more psychotic behavior evident on America's streets than there used to be, according to some psychiatrists.\nBut recently the campaign to treat patients in the community has been meeting resistance. In some states, the trend has slowed or even stopped. Several states, such as Washington, have changed their laws to make it easier for authorities to commit the mentally ill for involuntary treatment.\nSome mental health professionals, such as Dr. J. Frank James, the Oklahoma Commissioner of Mental Health, worry that there will be a swing back toward institutional care. Public pressure for such a change has increased amid reports that at least one-third of the nation's homeless have psychological problems.\nThe movement to empty state hospitals grew from a coalition of community mental health advocates, civil libertarians and fiscal conservatives, said Joseph P. Morrissey, who supervises research for the New York State Office of Mental Health.\nSupporters believed that it was better to treat the mentally ill in the community where they were closer to their families and jobs. New drugs that eliminated such flagrant symptoms as hallucinations allowed patients to live more easily outside hospitals. There were also financial incentives. Federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, helped pay for community care.\nAs a result of these factors, the census of state and county mental patients fell from a peak of 558,922 in 1955 to 116,136 in 1984, the last year for which figures are available from the National Institute of Mental Health. But adequate community facilities did not exist and were usually not developed. Former mental patients ended up in nursing homes, alleys and emergency rooms of public hospitals.\n''The chronic mentally ill patient had his locus of living and care transferred from a single lousy institution to multiple wretched ones,'' said Dr. John A. Talbott, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association and now editor of its journal Hospital and Community Psychiatry. ''The lawyers and other civil libertarians are not on the offensive any more,'' he said. ''There seems to be much more concern about individual and group safety rather than freedom at any cost.''\nFamilies of the mentally ill have joined the debate, complaining that outside the hospital their relatives sometimes resist necessary care. Ashton C. Dunham of Pittsburgh, who has a mentally ill son and has been a prominent advocate for the disabled, said that too often families must ''stand by helplessly and watch a loved one slowly degenerate.''\nWhile the number of people in state mental hospitals has declined, annual admissions have risen from 178,003 in 1955 to more than 400,000 in some recent years. This suggests that patients are being admitted for shorter stays, not for the type of long-term custodial care they received in the past.\nWhile the process of reducing the population of state mental hospitals has ''virtually ceased'' in some places, elsewhere the movement goes on, said Dr. Howard H. Goldman, director of mental health policy studies at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. Plans for New York\nIn fact, most states continue to recognize a need to improve community services, said Dr. James of Oklahoma, president of the National Association of State Mental Health Directors.''Contrary to some claims,'' he said, a survey of state mental health officials ''found no evidence of any widespread national trend reversing the community mental health movement.''\nNew York State officials said recently that during the next 10 years they intend to reduce by a third the number of patients in the state's 22 adult psychiatric hospitals. At the same time, they plan to increase the number of community residences for chronic mental patients. The number of patients in New York mental hospitals has already been cut to 22,000 from 93,300 in 1955.\nAcross the country, Dr. Goldman said, ''there appears to be a core of 75,000 resident patients for whom there is no available alternative to state hospital treatment.'' Many could be placed in the community if housing and other services were available, he said.\nTo protect the interests of society and the mentally ill, several states have adopted laws or procedures permitting authorities to order outpatient treatment. The patient can live in the community but must undergo treatment, which may include drug therapy.This procedure, known as involuntary outpatient commitment, is being tried in several states including North Carolina, Hawaii and Arizona.\nLeonard S. Rubenstein, who has represented many patients as a lawyer for the Mental Health Law Project, a nonprofit firm based in Washington, says the promise of humane treatment remains unfulfilled.\n''Naive expectations about transition to community care have been crushed,'' he said. ''States continue to channel their funds into large institutions, leaving chronic patients on the streets without housing, treatment or support. The answer to that problem is not to take away people's rights, but to provide for their needs in the community.''
711	Women Gain Degrees, but Not Tenure	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DC1038F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: JANUARY 1, 1987, was a red-letter day for Mary Jo Bane: On that date she became a professor of public policy at Harvard University.

It was something of a watershed for Harvard as well, since Dr. Bane, an expert on poverty and welfare, is the first tenured female faculty member in the history of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.\nDr. Bane is in good company. Across the country women are slowly making their way into the higher ranks of academia, for years a bastion of male clubbiness. Since 1975, the number of women college presidents in the United States has doubled, with women now heading more than 300 of the country's approximately 3,000 colleges and universities. During the same period, the number of women Ph.D.'s in full-time academic jobs has grown to just over 50,000, about one-fifth of the nationwide total.\nBut at a time when women constitute the majority of American college students and receive more than one-third of all doctorates, women faculty members and administrators still have many complaints about tenure, promotions and salaries. The phrase used by Lois Weis, a professor of education at the State University of New York at Buffalo, is ''progress but no parity.''\n''We've gotten rid of most of the horror stories, the overt policies and practices that used to harm women,'' said Bernice R. Sandler, director of the Association of American Colleges' Project on the Status and Education of Women. ''But women are still not advancing the way they should, given the number of Ph.D.'s granted.''\nIndeed, despite the gains of the last decade, American colleges still have an average of 1.1 women in senior administrative positions, for example. At the same time, the tenure rate for women instructors hovers just below 50 percent, compared to nearly 75 percent for men. And the unemployment rate for women Ph.D.'s, though small, is double that for men, noted Betty Vetter, executive director of the Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology.\nMoreover, the disparity between the salaries of male and female academics is striking. Ms. Vetter, whose Washington-based private, nonprofit group analyzes data compiled by the National Research Council, said that in 1985 the median full-time salary for men with Ph.D.'s in the humanities was $36,100, versus $30,900 for women with the same qualifications. For those with Ph.D.'s in the sciences and engineering, the gap was wider: a median salary of $46,100 for men, $35,600 for women.\n''Starting salaries for women faculty members are consistently below those for men in the same field,'' Ms. Vetter said. ''The rule is that the longer the experience, the wider the salary gap. Over the last 10 years, the dollars have changed a lot, but the percentage differential has not, so the dollar difference is big and getting bigger all the time.''\nOf growing concern to academic groups is the emergence of a new class of non-tenured instructors, of whom a disproportionate number are women. Statistics compiled by professional groups such as the American Association of University Professors indicate that of the more than 8,000 positions that women hold at the instructor and nonprofessorial levels, more than half are not on the tenure track.\nThough women hold only a quarter of all full-time faculty positions, about 45 percent of the lower-paid, non-tenure positions are filled by women.\nFigures gathered by the A.A.U.P. and other professional groups also indicate that these disparities transcend distinctions between colleges that are public or private, celebrated or not; some of the most respected universities in the nation have been identified as prime offenders. The University of Wisconsin at Madison, for example, pays a male full professor an average of $5,000 a year more than his female counterpart, according to the A.A.U.P.'s 1986 survey of academic salaries. And at Harvard, where the sociology department was the scene of a bitter dispute over tenure for a woman a few years ago, in 1985 only 5 percent of the total tenured faculty members, or 45 professors, were women, as against a nationwide average of about 20 percent.\nIn 13 departments, there were no tenured female faculty members at all.\nSex-discrimination suits have had mixed results at best. Some, such as the class action brought by faculty and staff members at the City University of New York, have brought multimillion-dollar settlements. And some have foundered as courts have ruled, for instance, that such notions as ''collegiality'' are legitimate considerations in the granting of tenure.\nEven favorable results in court are no guarantee of redress. When Anna Penk, a tenured professor of mathematics at Western Oregon State College, joined 21 colleagues in suing the state board of higher education, the judge found that she had been discriminated against in promotions but not in salary. Dr. Penk, who had been in the department for 12 years, recalled that while the case was being heard the college hired a former student of hers who had just finished his master's degree. ''The starting salary they gave him,'' she said, ''was $75 a year less than what they paid me.''

Tears streaming down her face, she stepped onto Soviet soil for the first time in nine years, one of 50 homesick emigres who returned to Moscow last week. ''This is my motherland,'' she said.\nREBECCA KATSAP was the first off the Aeroflot flight from New York. Tears streaming down her face, she stepped onto Soviet soil for the first time in nine years, one of 50 homesick emigres who returned to Moscow last week. ''This is my motherland,'' she said.\nThe repatriation of the emigres, some of whom had become American citizens during their time in the United States, was the latest step in what appears to be a Soviet effort to defuse criticism about its emigration policies - both at home and abroad.\nEmigration from the Soviet Union and repatriation are both tightly controlled. Although the world's attention has been on the movement of people out of the Soviet Union, Moscow also makes it difficult to return, rejecting all but a few repatriation requests.\nWestern diplomats have said that the recent changes are part of a growing willingness to address human rights concerns, including the treatment of dissidents. The most dramatic evidence of this was the return to Moscow last month of Andrei D. Sakharov, the physicist who was banished to the city of Gorky for nearly seven years.\nOn emigration, Western criticism has been particularly pointed in recent years as the flow of Jews, Armenians, ethnic Germans and others has fallen to fewer than a few thousand a year, compared with a peak of about 50,000 in 1979.\nThe Government is tackling the emigration matters with a combination of open and oblique moves that some diplomats believe are designed to pave the way for a modest increase in emigration in 1987 while reducing the allure the West holds for many Russians.\nOne step was the enactment of a new emigration law, which went into effect New Year's Day. Advertised as a move toward a more humane system, it simplifies and codifies a confusing array of regulations. Officials said that applications for exit visas will be reviewed within a month of submission in an effort to end the long delays associated with such cases.\nSoviet critics at home and abroad, including Anatoly B. Shcharansky, the political prisoner who was freed in February in an East-West exchange, have argued that the law will make emigration more difficult. Family reunification, for instance, is restricted to cases in which a close relative such as a parent, spouse, child or sibling lives in the West. Under the old system, reunification was often approved even when the relationship was more distant, such as cousins and grandparents.\nAlthough it remains to be seen how the law will be carried out, there have been promising signs that the emigration bottleneck may ease in some cases, particularly in those that involve divided spouses.\nIn Washington, State Department officials, while noting that individual cases are being resolved, expressed concern that in the long run the new law may not result in significant increases in emigration.\nA broad increase is partly contingent on the success of private talks between the Soviet Union and Israel. Diplomats say that the indirect communication between the two countries in recent months could lead to a rise in Jewish emigration. Moscow severed diplomatic relations during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.\nAt the same time, other steps are clearly intended to make emigration less attractive.\nThe group that returned last week included both elderly and young people, and some Jews. There seemed no common element beyond disenchantment with life in the West, and an impression that the things were improving in the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But many said they had waited years for Moscow to approve their return.\nThe press gave extensive coverage to the arrival of the emigres, whose message was conveyed by Valentin Agazarian, an Armenian tailor. ''I don't see a good life over there,'' he said. ''The United States has so many problems and life is hard.''\nSoviet television recently broadcast an American documentary about the life of Russian emigres in the United States that made clear that the adjustment to a strange society was not easy.\nThere were also reports that Moscow may be interested in persuading some prominent emigres, including Yuri Lyubimov, the theater director, to return from the West. Mr. Lyubimov, whose nonconformist work made him a cultural idol before he left in 1984, has said that he would consider returning only if he could have artistic freedom and no restrictions on his foreign travel, according to diplomats.\nIn another sign of lessening hostility, the death in Paris last week of Andrei A. Tarkovsky, a film director who defected to the West in 1984, was noted by the news agency Tass in an obituary that praised his contribution to Soviet cinema.\nIn a country where change can often be detected in seemingly minor developments, people who are seeking to move abroad were talking last week about changes at the office of visas and registration, the agency that processes emigration applications. Long regarded as the preserve of some of Moscow's most sullen bureaucrats, the agency's employees seemed suddenly transformed.\n''They were unbelievably polite,'' one Muscovite said.
713	EAST EUROPEANS MOVING TO ORGANIZE DISSIDENCE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB1038F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: CONTACTS among political dissidents and human rights advocates across the borders of the East European countries are growing in number and intensity. Poles, Czechoslovaks, Hungarians and, to a lesser extent, East Germans and even a few Rumanians have been exchanging views and signing joint appeals.\nCONTACTS among political dissidents and human rights advocates across the borders of the East European countries are growing in number and intensity. Poles, Czechoslovaks, Hungarians and, to a lesser extent, East Germans and even a few Rumanians have been exchanging views and signing joint appeals.\nIn November, more than 100 dissidents from all five countries signed what they called the Budapest Declaration, proclaiming the 1956 Hungarian uprising as the ''common heritage and inspiration'' of all East European states. The declaration was followed by a less-publicized but equally significant brief that was submitted to the Vienna conference on European security and cooperation. This paper was signed both by East Europeans promoting human rights and representatives of West European peace and disarmament groups. The document asserted the claims of citizens of all countries to organize freely on issues ranging from peace, ecology and labor organizing to resistance to the draft.\nSome East European dissidents have been establishing vague, albeit not altogether satisfactory, ties with West European peace groups. Most of the East Europeans stress human rights issues, and often they are patronizing toward and merely tolerate the peace groups' disarmament strategies. Still, for the Easterners, links with groups in the West that are the targets of Soviet propaganda and persuasion tend to provide some protection from official harassment.\nThe Budapest and Vienna efforts required considerable organizational skill, reflecting the intensifying, although still largely spontaneous, links that the dissidents have been establishing. ''There has definitely been a change,'' said Janusz Onyszkiewicz, a Polish mathematician and the former spokesman of the now-outlawed Solidarity independent union federation. ''Psychologically, there was always the will to cooperate across borders but the technical capabilities lagged behind,'' he added. Now, partly as a result of direct-dial international telephoning and the establishment of links through Western supporters, as well as the possibilities for peaceful protest demonstrated by the Poles during the Solidarity era, contacts are proliferating.\nPolish underground publishing houses are producing translations of works by Soviet, Hungarian and especially Czechoslovak dissidents. In Czechoslovakia, a more modest operation has printed Polish writers. And Hungarian editors of uncensored work have visited Poland to study clandestine production and distribution methods. Poles Mark Hungarian Uprising\nAn observance in a Roman Catholic church near Warsaw of the 30th anniversary of the Hungarian revolt, and its suppression by Soviet troops, drew 500 people, far more than were able to mark the day publicly in Budapest. A book of poems about the uprising was published clandestinely in Polish and Hungarian. A tablet in both languages was dedicated, commemorating those killed or wounded in battles with Soviet tanks.\nAt the same time, ''Largo Desolato,'' a play by Vaclaw Havel, the frequently imprisoned Czechoslovak writer and leader of the Charter 77 human rights group, is being performed in Warsaw homes by a theatrical troupe. In Budapest, directors have staged Polish plays about the cities now known as Lvov and Vilnius, which passed from Polish to Soviet control. Hungarian audiences liken the play's nostalgic references to their own yearnings for Transylvania, the province under Rumanian control, where the Hungarian language and culture and, according to many, the safety of ethnic Hungarians are threatened.\nFurthermore, emigre groups in the West, who have usually concentrated on their own separate concerns, are establishing closer links. The American periodical, Across Frontiers, and the London-based East-West Foundation publish the work of East European rights activists. And Kontinent, a magazine founded with West German backing by Soviet emigres, has various nationalities represented on its editorial board.\nCooperation across East European frontiers ''is significant but it is moving at an uneven pace because of different levels of repression,'' Mr. Onyszkiewicz said. The Bucharest Government punishes Rumanians who are caught even speaking with foreigners. In Bulgaria, the closest Soviet ally, no significant dissident movement, apart from the oppressed Turkish minority, seems to have coalesced.\nSeveral activists cited the effort to assemble signatures for the Budapest Declaration, which said that the Budapest rebellion, the 1968 ''Prague spring'' and the Polish Solidarity era all expressed the yearnings for change. When issued, the document carried the names of 54 Hungarians, 28 Poles, 24 Czechoslovaks and 16 East Germans. In fact, while the text was being quietly circulated, some 500 Poles volunteered to sign it. There were many hurt feelings as the Polish group was winnowed down so as not to overwhelm the others. ''The Poles have the strongest opposition and they have the freest hand,'' said a Hungarian organizer. He added that perhaps the most remarkable achievement of the declaration was that three Rumanians later added their names, thus risking severe punishment.\n''As Poles, we have to avoid setting the pace without considering the dangers that exist elsewhere,'' said Mr. Onyszkiewicz. ''A few years ago, some of our dissidents met with our Czechoslovak friends from Charter 77 at a border town. For our people, it meant two days of questioning. For the Czechs it meant months and even years in prison.''

Now, six years into the Reagan Administration, this venerable agency provides a case history of hotly disputed application of the Reagan philosophy of deregulation.\nConsumer advocates say it is clear that the protection of consumers by the Food and Drug Administration has declined in the Reagan years. The F.D.A. counters that protection has actually been improved, as tight budgets force efficiency and as industry cooperation increases.\nIn a 1982 speech to the drug industry that is now being cited by both supporters and critics of the agency, Vice President Bush said, ''I think we've started to see this philosophical shift, the end - or the beginning of the end - of this adversarial relationship. Government shouldn't be an adversary. It should be a partner.''\nCalling the speech ''prescient,'' Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, who heads the Health Research Group, a consumer organization, said, ''We've seen a deterioration in the F.D.A.'s policing of the drug-medical device industry, and Americans are beginning to taste the fatal or health-destroying fruits of this partnership.''\nJohn A. Norris, the Deputy Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said Mr. Bush was simply describing ''an attempt to eliminate unnecessary adversarial contact with industry.'' He said, ''We consider ourselves partners with consumers and manufacturers in providing therapies needed by the people.''\nDr. Wolfe said unnecessary deaths and injuries had been caused by the agency's desire to cooperate with industry. One example, he said, was delay in warning parents of a link between aspirin and Reye's syndrome, a rare, often fatal disease that primarily afflicts children just getting over a virus infection. The F.D.A. ordered warning labels for aspirin bottles in March, under pressure from Congress, after a Government study affirmed the link to the disease.\n''In October 1981 a Federal Government advisory committee recommended against the use of aspirin for chicken pox or flu because of the increased risk of Reye's syndrome,'' Dr. Wolfe said, ''but, as a result of pressure of the aspirin industry . . . a proposal by the F.D.A. for mandatory warning labels was withdrawn in the fall of 1982. As a result, 150 American children are dead and dozens have brain damage. Most, if not all, would have been avoidable if action had been taken. Now warning labels are mandatory and the problem has practically disappeared, but it is too late for the dead and injured.''\nMr. Norris said, ''I worked on this for a year and a half with industry to support voluntary relabeling and more recently in crafting new regulations. There is no doubt at all in my mind that the voluntary effort of the industry and the regulations of the F.D.A. have been effective.'' Another official of the agency, Dr. Robert Temple, director of the office of drug research and review, said that Dr. Wolfe ''can't know whether the publicity and voluntary warnings were not more effective than a mandatory ruling.''\nOther instances cited by Dr. Wolfe included an artificial heart valve and a painkiller that he said has been linked to nonfatal kidney failure.\nThe valve, made by the Shiley division of Pfizer, was withdrawn from the market in November, but Dr. Wolfe said the F.D.A. had known of a defect in it since February 1981. ''Since then, 193 valves have fractured, with an estimated 129 fatalities,'' Dr. Wolfe contended.\nMr. Norris said, ''We would love to have all the risks be zero, but in any of these procedures there are real risks. There was not a greater risk here than in other heart valves.'' The Food and Drug Administration has noted that the Shiley valves virtually eliminated a blood clotting problem prevalent in other makers' valves. Debate Over Painkiller\nThe painkiller is suprofen, distributed by McNeil Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Suprol, which, Dr. Wolfe said, ''has been taken off the market in Britain but is still on the market in the United States, and as a result over 300 cases of acute kidney failures have occurred in Americans.'' The agency says suprofen should be used only if other painkillers are not effective.\nDr. Wolfe asserted that the agency failed to remove suprofen because it was approving too many drug applications - 30 last year.\nMr. Norris said that this was ''the most scurrilous of his allegations.'' The average review period for a new drug, he said, is 24 months, even though the law requires action in six months. And the approval process for suprofen took 86 months. ''It is outrageous to characterize that as a drug rush,'' Mr. Norris said.\nIndeed, some industry and physicians' groups attack the agency for moving too cautiously, especially on experimental drugs that have shown promise in treating such otherwise incurable illnesses as Alzheimer's disease and AIDS. Mr. Norris replies that the agency is moving as rapidly as is consistent with safety.\nOther consumer groups echo Dr. Wolfe. Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, complained, for example, about a voluntary program to note the presence of sulfites on the labels of nonprescription drugs. Some people suffer a fatal allergic reaction to sulfites. ''Even if 5 or 10 percent of drug companies don't comply, it would result in acute injury and death,'' he said. ''It is not satisfactory if it is below 100 percent.''\nMr. Norris responded, ''If you want to move swiftly on something, it is best to pursue voluntary action first because mandatory actions are time-consuming.''
715	SHULTZ TO SEEK STRONGER TIES IN BLACK AFRICA	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDB1038F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: GEORGE P. SHULTZ leaves this week on an eight-day trip to six African countries that are rarely visited by American secretaries of state.\nGEORGE P. SHULTZ leaves this week on an eight-day trip to six African countries that are rarely visited by American secretaries of state.\nAs he flies from Senegal to Cameroon, across the continent to Kenya, and back to Nigeria, the Ivory Coast and Liberia, Mr. Shultz's main themes are likely to be economic ideology and anti-Soviet strategy, State Department officials said. Mr. Shultz wants to reinforce the trend toward free market economies and cement ties as a bulwark against Soviet influence. Other likely topics include Libya's support for terrorism and attacks in Chad, drug trafficking in Nigeria, and human rights in Kenya and Liberia. Mr. Shultz is the first secretary of state to visit sub-Saharan Africa since Cyrus R. Vance accompanied President Carter in 1978. Henry A. Kissinger was there in 1976 and William P. Rogers in 1970. SENEGAL\nOnce a major departure point for Africans being taken into slavery in America, Senegal now maintains close diplomatic and economic ties with the United States, providing the alternative landing site for the space shuttle and space tracking stations. It received $47 million in American aid last year, much of it geared to invigorating private enterprise.\nDakar, the colonial headquarters of French West Africa, still has the atmosphere of a French provincial town.\nSenegal became independent in 1960, with Leopold Sedar Senghor, the poet and statesman, as President. He retired in 1981 and was succeeded by Abdou Diouf, who was elected to a five-year term in 1983. LIBERIA\nOriginally a haven for freed American slaves (hence the name), Liberia has close cultural, linguistic and monetary ties with the United States. But the relationship has been troubled since the 1980 coup in which Samuel K. Doe, an army sergeant, took power and established the first Government of Liberians who were not descendants of the 19th century settlers. When it imposed martial law and made political arrests, Liberia came under pressure from Washington to improve its human rights record, and the delivery of some American aid was delayed. More recently, about $10 million has been held up for several months in an effort to induce Liberia to undertake economic reforms. IVORY COAST\nA major economic success story, the Ivory Coast is the base for much of American business in western Africa. The influence of France, its former colonial ruler, is very much in evidence, especially in Abidjan, the modern capital, which has far more French residents now than at the time of independence in 1960. The Ivory Coast also maintains close ties with the front-line states of southern Africa, and Washington looks to President Felix Houphouet-Boigny as a respected authority on issues involving the white Government in South Africa. These are expected to be major points of discussion during Secretary Shultz's visit. Mr. Houphouet-Boigny has been chief of state since independence. KENYA\nPopular with British colonial settlers because of its climate, and now a tourist attraction for its mountains and wild game parks, Kenya has more than 20 million people, the fastest-growing population in the world, the State Department estimates. The resulting severe economic problems are expected to get attention during Secretary Shultz's visit.\nThe Government of President Daniel arap Moi has been arresting political dissidents in recent months, provoking quiet expressions of official concern from Washington. Kenya is receiving $43 million in American aid this year. It is one of the few places bordering the Indian Ocean where United States Navy ships can put into port for liberty. CAMEROON\nWith a Government that is Western-leaning, Cameroon enjoys substantial investment by American companies, including banks and oil companies, and has about 1,000 students in the United States. Its Atlantic coast is on a vital supply route for landlocked Chad, which is fighting off Libyan troops. The Peace Corps has had a large program in Cameroon since 1962, and the country is receiving $20 million in aid this year. A German colony before World War I, it was divided into French and British sectors under League of Nations mandates, later becoming United Nations trusteeships. French Cameroons became independent in 1960; the rest was split with Nigeria after plebiscites in 1961. Paul Biya is President. NIGERIA\nWith more than 100 million people, one-fourth of black Africa's population and extensive oil reserves, Nigeria carries significant diplomatic and economic weight. Major topics of discussion during Secretary Shultz's visit are expected to be the Reagan Administration's stand on South Africa, joint American-Nigerian efforts to block one of the international routes for heroin bound for the United States, and the recent Nigerian ban on imports of American wheat, valued at $225 million in 1985. Although Nigeria is the fifth-largest source of imported oil for the United States, economic problems have forced the Government of Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida to adopt austerity measures.
716	NUCLEAR ALARM STIRS HONG KONG ACTIVISM	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDB1038F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A NUCLEAR plant under construction in China just 30 miles from Hong Kong is generating enormous heat in this crowded British territory. The project, which is not scheduled for completion until 1992, has already aroused a political typhoon and caused tension between Hong Kong and its vast neighbor to the north.\nA NUCLEAR plant under construction in China just 30 miles from Hong Kong is generating enormous heat in this crowded British territory. The project, which is not scheduled for completion until 1992, has already aroused a political typhoon and caused tension between Hong Kong and its vast neighbor to the north.\nNo one in Hong Kong paid much attention to China's proposal to build the nuclear plant at Daya Bay when it was first discussed early in this decade. But in the last several months, after the accident in April at the Chernobyl plant in the Soviet Union, Hong Kong residents have been distressed at the prospect of such a facility on their doorstep.\nPerhaps even more fundamentally, the situation raised new doubts about whether China can be trusted after it absorbs Hong Kong in 1997. If China does not heed the British colony's wishes now, some say, why should it pay attention to such concerns after the territory becomes a part of the motherland? A Chinese official in Hong Kong grimaced at that logic. ''A lot of resources already have been committed to the project,'' he said. ''China says, 'Why should we give it up because of a lot of people who don't know about nuclear power?' It's a very difficult situation for China.''\nOf course, Hong Kong has been gripped by political events in the past. In the late 1960's the colony was shaken by riots sponsored by admirers of Mao Zedong, the late Chinese leader. But Daya Bay marked the first time that many Hong Kong residents had signed a petition or taken a controversial stand.\nThe Hong Kong Government, led by a British-appointed governor, is also in an awkward position. At first it refused to release a 1984 study it commissioned to examine the Daya Bay proposal. Later the Government backed down and released part of that report. This unusual concession to public opinion hurt the antinuclear campaign; the report strongly favored the plant.\n''A lot of people think if they can't get the plumbing right in Peking, how can they get nuclear power right,'' said Peter B. Harris, chairman of the political science department at Hong Kong University. Like many others, he believes that concern over the Daya Bay plant has forced Hong Kong for almost the first time to take a substantial interest in politics. Normally apathetic Hong Kong residents have rallied against the project, and 20 percent of the territory's 5.5 million residents have signed a petition objecting to it.\n''The middle class woke up,'' explained Albert W.Y. Chan, a social worker and politician. Mr. Chan says that Daya Bay has for the first time created a political system based on mass participation, not small interest groups.\nProfessor Harris agrees: ''There are signs that a political consciousness is beginning to emerge for the first time. In politics, you've taken the cork out of the bottle, and you won't be able to put it back again.'' British Engines\n''Hong Kong people are quite reluctant to take a stance, especially on a political issue,'' explained the Rev. Fung Chi-Wood, a 30-year-old Anglican who is leading the campaign against the Daya Bay plant.\nDespite the protests and opinion polls showing that most Hong Kong residents favor a halt or delay in the construction of the plant, neither Hong Kong's Government nor Britain's seems to have done anything to dissuade China. Indeed, some Hong Kong residents charge that Britain has accepted the risk to Hong Kong because a British company will supply turbines for the $28-billion plant.\nPushed into a defensive alliance, Britain, China and Hong Kong all assert that the plant will be safe, that it is sufficiently far from Hong Kong and that it will be the cheapest source of power. Southern China is desperately short of electricity, to the point that industrial growth must be curtailed, and Hong Kong is expected to face a shortage in the next decade. While 70 percent of Daya Bay's output will be sold to a Hong Kong utility, some will be left to ease the shortage in the area around Canton, China.\nThe Daya Bay protests may not be enough to stop the nuclear plant, but they are likely to reverberate through Hong Kong's emerging political system. Proponents of direct elections to choose territorial leaders say their movement has gained support as a result of the nuclear controversy.

718	IN DEFENSE, JAPAN PUTS A TOE OVER THE 1% LINE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DA1038F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: JAPAN put an abrupt end last week to years of public agonizing and knocked down one of its stouter pillars of military policy. Unexpectedly, the Government approved a 1987 defense allocation of $22 billion, an amount that will exceed 1 percent of the projected gross national product by four one-thousandths of a percentage point.\nJAPAN put an abrupt end last week to years of public agonizing and knocked down one of its stouter pillars of military policy. Unexpectedly, the Government approved a 1987 defense allocation of $22 billion, an amount that will exceed 1 percent of the projected gross national product by four one-thousandths of a percentage point. For a decade, the 1 percent level had been the outer limit of permissible military spending. So its abrogation, even by a hair-thin margin, produced a strong, if predictable, reaction. Opposition parties charged that Japan was embarking on a rapid arms buildup, while Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone countered that nothing was farther from reality.\nFor now, the facts seem to support Mr. Nakasone. It is not the Japanese style to do anything rapidly on a matter as grave as defense. The Government, after all, flirted with the 1 percent barrier for years. Moreover, even before last week Japan had adopted a five-year military program that is supposed to total $115 billion through 1991, an expenditure that works out to 1.04 percent of projected G.N.P. for the period, hardly a galloping break from the old policy.\nThe country's long preoccupation with a specific percentage, some defense specialists say, has obscured the more important question of how the money is spent. Gradually, avoiding divisive domestic debate, Japan has expanded its military role, acquiring new weaponry, developing technologies and aligning itself more closely with United States strategy in the Pacific. This cooperation has grown in recent years as the Japanese, worried about a surge of Soviet naval and air power across Asia, have identified Moscow as the main threat to their security.\nThat does not mean Japan can ignore constraints on its military that go well beyond a reluctance to spend too much. The armed forces, assiduously called Self-Defense Forces, are permitted to fight only if the country is directly attacked. Under a 27-year-old treaty, the United States must come to Japan's aid in wartime, but Japan is prevented from returning the favor by a Constitution that bars it from entering into ''collective security'' arrangements. Its nuclear arms potential is crippled by a longstanding Government policy that bars such weapons from being possessed, manufactured or introduced into the country. These policies sometimes lead to anomalies. While Japan calculates that it ranks eighth in the world in defense spending, its 180,000-troop army is far smaller than that of any of its North Asian neighbors. The Japanese navy is the fifth largest in terms of tonnage, but it lacks big ships associated with naval power; it has, for example, no aircraft carriers, which are considered to be offensive in nature.\nSlowly, these self-imposed - some say self-conscious - limitations are eroding. A dozen years ago Japan purchased F-4 jets from the United States that lacked special fittings for in-flight refueling. With limited flying range, it was argued, the planes could not be considered offensive. Now Tokyo is acquiring F-15 fighter jets -12 are provided for in the new budget - and all carry in-flight refueling equipment. Close Ties With U.S. More broadly, Japan has stretched its definition of self-defense beyond anything previously considered acceptable. At American urging, it has committed itself to defending sea lanes up to 1,000 nautical miles - about 1,150 miles - from its coast to ease the burden of the overextended American Seventh Fleet. The Japanese are in no position yet to make good that promise, but they say they will be ready in the 1990's.\nMr. Nakasone declares Japan to be part of the Western alliance more insistently than his predecessors. His Government has shared sensitive intelligence reports with Washington. In 1983 it agreed also to provide military technology, and last September it joined the Reagan Administration's space-based missile defense program, although talks on a specific Japanese role are stalled. Joint military exercises with the United States have become routine and increasingly sophisticated, while the Government appears to have bent the prohibition against introducing nuclear arms by tacitly accepting port calls by American warships presumed to be carrying such weapons. Only 15 years ago, most of these moves would have touched off anti-Government protests. But there is no such reaction in the prevailing conservative mood.\nThe United States, which will spend about 6.1 percent of the American gross national product on defense in fiscal year 1987, has praised the changes. The steady expansion is attacked, however, by the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He has said that Japan wants to join the United States and South Korea in an Asian version of NATO, but defense officials here dismiss the charge as groundless. On the face of it, it seems that Japan is content to take its time about becoming a military power. Even as the Government swept aside the 1 percent limit, it began considering a new rule. A new formulation is expected soon, and a leading contender is a policy that would restrict military spending to ''about 1 percent'' of G.N.P. In a country with an appetite for both vague phraseology and slow change, that concept should find many supporters.
719	A CASE OF RACIAL VIOLENCE IS BESET BY CONTRADICITONS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DA1038F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: IT was a ''solid case'' against the white youths, who admitted attacking the blacks, but it fell apart in court and the whites were freed.\nIT was a ''solid case'' against the white youths, who admitted attacking the blacks, but it fell apart in court and the whites were freed.\nThe white motorist who admitted killing one of the blacks with his car said he would testify, but a black victim refused to do so.\nA black lawyer, without citing detailed evidence, charged an official coverup; authorities denied it and cited many details, but confusion and doubt prompted the intervention of a special state prosecutor.\nSuch were the twists, turns and contradictions last week in the Howard Beach case: an ugly episode that touched a raw nerve in many blacks and whites and has drawn City Hall, black leaders, the police, prosecutors and various lawyers into a maelstrom of anger and mistrust after years of relative racial peace in the city.\nAs the case staggered through a second week, it remained manifestly riddled with confusion -gaps in police accounts, contradictions among witnesses and disagreements among lawyers and authorities over even the simplest facts. The resulting deadlock all but stymied the prosecution.\nThe facts least in dispute were these: Three blacks walking through the mostly white, middle-class Howard Beach section of Queens early Dec. 20 after their car broke down were chased and beaten by a dozen white youths wielding fists, a bat and a tree limb. One victim, Timothy Grimes, got away; another, Cedric Sandiford, was severely beaten twice.\nMr. Sandiford's stepson, 23-year-old Michael Griffith, fled the attack through a hole in a fence and, on the Shore Parkway just west of Kennedy Airport, was struck and killed by the car of Dominick Blum, 24, a court officer, who drove away, returned an hour later and was not charged after he said he thought he had hit a tire or an animal.\nThe police said Mr. Sandiford told them he also escaped through the fence and saw a car from the chase again on the highway, but did not see the fatal crash. Three white youths were seized on murder and other charges, and Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward called the case ''solid.''\nThen the contradictions arose. Mr. Sandiford's lawyer, Alton H. Maddox Jr., said his client had seen the crash. He charged that Mr. Blum was an accomplice of the attackers and had deliberately killed Mr. Griffith. He said Mr. Sandiford would not cooperate unless Mr. Blum was charged with murder. He also said his client was strip-searched and otherwise mistreated by officers. The police denied mistreating Mr. Sandiford and said their inquiry showed Mr. Blum had merely been driving by and hit Mr. Griffith accidentally.\nIn Queens Criminal Court Monday, the only testimony came from police officers quoting the suspects. Police said one youth recalled saying, ''There's some niggers in the pizza parlor - let's go kill them.'' Another told of beating the blacks and of seeing Mr. Griffith flying through the air after being hit by a car.\nAmid cries of ''injustice,'' Judge Ernest Bianchi called the evidence insufficient and dismissed murder, manslaughter and assault charges against Jon L. Lester, 17 years old, Scott Kern, 17, and Jason Ladone, 16. Only a reckless endangerment charge was left, and the youths were freed on bail.\nLegal experts said Queens District Attorney John J. Santucci could still take the case to a grand jury, but without the testimony of Mr. Sandiford - the only person besides the whites who saw Mr. Griffith go through the fence - the prosecution chances were slim. Mr. Blum, the driver, said he would testify without immunity, but his account might have less bearing on the case than on his own liability for leaving the scene.\nProsecutors could attempt to force Mr. Sandiford to testify, experts said, but that path might lead to a political minefield. For example, if Mr. Sandiford were to defy a legal order to testify, officials might face the uncomfortable prospect of having to jail a victim of racial violence.\nLaw enforcement officials said Mr. Santucci might turn the case over to Federal authorities for prosecution as a civil-rights violation. Mr. Maddox said the victims would cooperate in a Federal case, but preferred that Governor Cuomo appoint a special prosecutor.\nOn Friday, Deputy Attorney General Charles J. Hynes, the state's special prosecutor for the Criminal Justice System, agreed to look into the handling of the case by the police and the district attorney. That appeared to be unsatisfactory to Mr. Maddox, who wanted an independent prosecutor to take over the entire case.\nMeanwhile, a customarily contentious Mayor Koch assumed a peacemaker's role. Mr. Koch, who is sometimes accused of insensitivity toward blacks, was booed in a white church and cheered in a black church. Later he met with Howard Beach residents and joined in defending the community against allegations of racism. He also joined with 23 black leaders in decrying ''pervasive and systemic'' racism in the city.\nBut questions persisted: Why was Mr. Blum not charged with leaving the scene? Why was his car not impounded? Did the district attorney ignore Mr. Sandiford's account? What did he see at the fence and on the highway? Was Mr. Griffith forced to run onto the highway to his death?\nThe police said Mr. Blum was not charged because it was not clear he had done anything wrong; they said his car was not impounded because they had all the evidence they needed from it. Mr. Sandiford's account was not ignored, the district attorney said. Authorities said he did not witness Mr. Griffith's death.\nBut if all this was so, why was Mr. Maddox withholding cooperation by Mr. Sandiford? Commissioner Ward, who is black, accused the lawyer of angling for a lucrative wrongful-death lawsuit; Mr. Maddox tearfully denied it. Others said Mr. Maddox might be trying to advance his own political agenda or to punish racism not in a courtroom but in a larger political arena. Like racism, the questions seemed to go on and on.

In recent interviews, American, Nicaraguan, Honduran and rebel officials all seemed to agree that fighting would step up in the coming months.\nThey gave two reasons. One is that United States military aid is now reaching the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, which will allow them to pick up the pace of their operations.\nSecond, these officials said, the contras believe they must score early military successes to challenge the Sandinista Government for control of Nicaragua and to justify the continuation of American aid.\nCongress approved $100 million in aid to the contras in October, $70 million of which was for military equipment and training. Of this aid, $30 million has already been given to them. More Money Due in February\nAn additional $40 million is due to be released in February, unless Congress votes to cut off the aid. If that happens, President Reagan would have to veto the Congressional action to keep the money flowing. In the view of those interviewed, continued American support is critical to the contras' survival.\nNicaraguan officials express confidence that their military strategy will prevent major gains by the contras regardless of American aid. In a New Year's Eve address, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra said that United States assistance to the contras had ''produced nothing'' and that the rebels were ''in the process of decomposition.''\nNicaraguan strategy is designed to keep pressure on the contras along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border so they cannot infiltrate the interior of Nicaragua from their camps in Honduras.\nDespite the overall confidence expressed by the Sandinistas, there is speculation by some senior Sandinista officers that the contras might try to seize and hold a town in Nicaragua in the coming months.\nThese officers say they believe the contras' goal would be to declare the surrounding area ''free Nicaragua.'' This, they said, would give Mr. Reagan a pretext to recognize the contras as the legitimate government and to come to its aid by invading Nicaragua. U.S. in Honduras Maneuvers\nUnited States military maneuvers in Honduras are viewed by the Sandinista military leadership as preparations for such an invasion.\nThe Nicaraguan Defense Minister, Humberto Ortega Saavedra, who is the President's brother, said in a year-end review of military operations that any contra attempt to seize and hold Nicaraguan territory would be defeated.\nIn 1983, the contras succeeded in capturing and temporarily holding the small Nicaraguan farming community of El Porvenir, near the Honduran border. Since then, there have been no known similar attempts, although in October 1983 the contras raided the town of Pantasma in the interior.\nAlthough both the Ortega brothers play down the abilities of the contras, the Defense Minister acknowledged that the Sandinista Army had not been fully successful in keeping them out of Nicaragua. He puts the number of contras in Nicaragua at 1,000; United States officials in Nicaragua say there are about 4,000 contras there now.\nEnrique Bermudez, military leader of the Nicaraguan Democratic Forces, the largest of the contra groups, said that American military aid was getting to the contras and that his forces would make inroads against the Sandinistas in the coming months.\nAn American military expert who was in the contra camps just before Christmas said he had observed two groups of more than 100 well-equipped guerrillas leave on a infiltration mission into Nicaragua. Hit-and-Run Raids Seen\nContra representatives declined to say exactly what the rebels plan to do with their forces inside Nicaragua. It is generally believed by military officers in both Nicaragua and Honduras that for the immediate future the Nicaraguan contras will be capable only of hit-and-run raids against isolated Sandinista outposts in the sparsely populated mountains.\nThe Sandinistas also say the contras may in desperation undertake a spectacular commando raid against Soviet-supplied helicopters as a way of attracting Congressional attention. They say they believe that there are contras now being trained in the United States for just that purpose.\nAmerican experts in guerrilla warfare say that if the contras hope to overthrow the Sandinistas, they need to develop a broad base of political support. This, they say, means the contras must develop organized opposition to the Sandinistas within Nicaragua, particularly in the cities. Diplomats and military experts view an urban-based resistance movement as critical to the success of any insurgency.\nOfficials at the American Embassy in Managua acknowledge that the contras face a difficult task in developing a base of urban support. They point out that although there is opposition to the Sandinista Government in the cities, Interior Minister Tomas Borge has been highly successful in suppressing it in the principal population centers.\nEven if the contras have immediate military success in the countryside, they say, it will be difficult to capitalize on those successes in the cities in the foreseeable future.

Yet he's taken it upon himself to deplore ''the spectacle'' of the United States ''having little time for anything except relentless self-investigation.''\nA little more relentless self-investigation by the Israeli Government might have avoided the apparent whitewashing of everyone concerned in the beating deaths in 1984 of two handcuffed Palestinians who were in the custody of Israeli agents. As it is, the authority of the Israeli president, who granted pardons without investigation, has been undermined; and so has that of the Cabinet, which requested that the pardons be granted.\nIn order to accomplish the whitewash, Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir - who was Prime Minister at the time of the murders - muscled a tough attorney general out of office and replaced him with one who would support the Cabinet's request for the pardons. That, Israeli legal experts say, has damaged the authority of the Justice Ministry, too.\nAvraham Shalom, who was head of Shin Beth, the domestic intelligence service when the two Palestinians were killed, was given immunity from prosecution and resigned from his prestigious post. Yitzhak Shamir, who was Mr. Shalom's only superior, has just been cleared by a police commission of any complicity in the two deaths. Thus - as with President Reagan and the Iranian arms sales -the question arises which is worse: that Prime Minister Shamir did not know what his own intelligence service was doing, as the commission reported; or that as the man to whom the intelligence chief supposedly reported, the Prime Minister did know and has been protected by cover-up?\nIsraelis are left to wonder. And all this, together with the loss of public confidence in Shin Beth, is the result of Tel Aviv's failure to engage in ''relentless self-investigation.'' As Meir Zorea, a retired general who conducted the first inquiry into the captives' deaths, said after Mr. Shamir was cleared: ''This entire affair stinks from top to bottom, from day one until today.''\nSo does the Iran arms-sale scandal in Washington, and the possible diversion of the proceeds to help overthrow the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua. But the point here is not merely to tell Abba Eban - a friend of the United States - to look to the problems of his own society.\nAmericans, he insisted in a New York Times article, should avoid ''obsession with a single issue that is, after all, not the central human cause.'' Of course it isn't but no one has said it was; and what Mr. Eban and other such foreign counselors really mean is that Americans should not become so obsessed with ''relentless self-investigation'' that they neglect the hopes and desires of allies like Israel.\nMr. Eban thinks, for example, that during Washington's Watergate preoccupation in 1974 an opportunity may have been missed for Henry Kissinger to work out an Israeli-Jordanian disengagement accord like those that had been reached with Israel and Syria. Even if Mr. Eban is right, does he seriously suggest Americans should have closed their eyes to the Watergate offenses against law and Constitution so that the Nixon Administration could have pursued its diplomacy unimpeded and perhaps have improved the Middle East situation?\nApparently so, for Mr. Eban also suggests that a new U.S. initiative in the Middle East now might prove fruitful for Israel and other nations of the region, and remarks that ''it is for America to decide whether this vision is less alluring or worthy than a prolonged investigatory ordeal.''\nThis reflects a profound misunderstanding of the rule of law that is at the root of American democracy, and an even greater misreading of democracy's limits. Nothing undermines that rule, hence democracy, more than the ability of some temporary government, even for purposes believed good, to set aside the law, or distort it, or ignore it - as Israelis may be learning from their own experience.\nA democracy's foreign policy, moreover, is never stronger than the confidence of its people in the integrity of those who conduct it - which Israelis might also have learned from their war in Lebanon. That confidence has been impaired in the United States, and cannot be restored by cover-up or closed eyes.\nConfidence in the Reagan Administration may not be restored by ''prolonged investigatory ordeal'' either. But confidence in the rule of law can be - a prospect that does indeed seem worthier than new diplomatic gestures by a sadly discredited President.
723	With a Shift of Gravity, Congress Begins Era	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DE1138F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THE opening of the 100th Congress Tuesday brings an end to an extraordinary interregnum. In only 11 weeks since the 99th Congress adjourned, the political world has been transformed. The November elections and the Iran-contra arms affair overturned many of the realities and assumptions of the last six years.\nTHE opening of the 100th Congress Tuesday brings an end to an extraordinary interregnum. In only 11 weeks since the 99th Congress adjourned, the political world has been transformed. The November elections and the Iran-contra arms affair overturned many of the realities and assumptions of the last six years.\nThroughout those years, President Reagan's immense popularity and credibility made the White House the Government's undisputed center of gravity. The President's agenda was the national agenda. He did not win every battle with Congress, but his priorities established the framework for the debate.\nBut suddenly, the Administration is on the defensive; Mr. Reagan's standing in the polls has plunged; both houses of Congress are in Democratic hands for the first time since the Reagan era began, and Congress is about to place the Administration's most glaring failure under a microscope. Suddenly, the center of gravity has shifted to Capitol Hill.\nThis unanticipated development brings responsibility and risk. With new leaders in both houses, and with the next Presidential election cycle already under way, this Congressional session promises to be a time of intense personal and institutional testing.\nThe investigations of the Iran-contra affair by two select committees, with all the resonances of Watergate that the very words summon up, will dominate the atmosphere for the foreseeable future. That, too, is both an opportunity and a challenge. The committees - 11 senators, most of them quite senior, and 15 House members, a flammable mixture of Democratic committee chairmen and scrappy young conservative Republicans - were born in a bipartisan glow of professed determination to get at the truth, but the bipartisan spirit may eventually wear thin.\nIf so, Congress could easily squander the unusual degree of public support and confidence with which it is entering the new year. Polls usually place Congress far down on the list of institutions trusted by the public. But a New York Times/CBS News Poll Nov. 30 showed that, by more than 2 to 1, the public trusted Congress rather than President Reagan to ''make the right decisions on foreign policy.'' This support could well dissipate if partisan posturing creates the impression of a witch hunt against the President.\nThe dominance of the Iran investigations will give Congressional leaders still another challenge. Time and energy must be found for legislative accomplishments that go beyond reconstructing the errors of the past. Democrats are keenly aware that there will be no one to blame but themselves if the party enters 1988 without a solid record of achievements in Congress. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who is about to resume the post of majority leader that he lost six years ago, told a group of national Democratic leaders last month: ''The American people have given the Democratic Party two years to answer one question - can the Democrats govern the nation in the post-Reagan era?''\nBut fiscal realities remain a tight noose around any creative impulses. With the law requiring a zero budget deficit by 1990, the chances of enacting new programs that cost money are slight. And the mere mention of new taxes makes many Democrats run for cover. The incoming Speaker of the House, Jim Wright of Texas, suggested last month that the full benefit of the new, lower tax rates might be delayed for the wealthiest taxpayers; he was promptly criticized by fellow Democrats who believe that the party is as vulnerable as ever to the ''tax and spend'' opprobrium heaped on it by President Reagan.\nBoth Mr. Wright and Senator Byrd want to move quickly on trade legislation, a focus of the Democrats' efforts in the fall campaigns. This week the Speaker will reintroduce an omnibus trade bill that was denounced as protectionist by President Reagan last year and never reached the Senate floor. Mr. Wright said Friday that overcoming the trade deficit was ''the first imperative'' of the session and that the bill would serve as a starting point for debate.\nThere will be quick floor action in both houses to pass the $18-billion renewal of the Clean Water Act. The bill had been approved unanimously but was vetoed after Congress adjourned by Mr. Reagan, who denounced it as ''budget-busting'' again yesterday. Both houses also plan early consideration of a highway aid bill and arms control issues.\nPresident Reagan's budget for the 1988 fiscal year will be presented tomorrow; it exceeds a trillion dollars, for the first time, and is certain to get a skeptical reception. In a preview last week, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger sought an additional $2.8 billion in the current fiscal year; legislators responded briskly that the Pentagon would have to convince them the need was an emergency.\nBut the freedom Congress has to disregard the Administration's spending priorities does not ease the task of making and defending choices of its own. For instance, Democrats would much prefer to reject such Administration proposals as a halving of aid to mass transit. But the budget-balancing law set a 1988 deficit ceiling of $108 billion; the projection last week was $174.5 billion; more than $65 billion in savings must be found somewhere if the target is to be met. Personnel Questions, Early and Late\nSome delicate personnel matters must be resolved early in the session: Will Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin remain as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee? Will Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana fend off a challenge from Jesse Helms of North Carolina for the seat of ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee?\nAnd the ultimate personnel question in politics, who will be the next to occupy the White House, will be a strong motif. Both the Senate and House are home to some already running hard and to some considering whether to try. In the former category are Senator Robert Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader; Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware and the new Judiciary Committee chairman, and Representative Jack F. Kemp, Republican of upstate New York. The possible candidates include Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the Democrat who will be chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\nIt is a confusing picture so far. But if there is one lesson from the interregnum that is about to end, it is that a lot can happen in a very short time.\nPOLITICAL EROSION
724	DELHI'S POOR GET 2 BLANKETS BUT LITTLE ELSE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DD1138F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Shivering in the biting evening cold, hundreds of poor and ill-clad men, homeless and anonymous, slip every night into the warmth of a huge concrete dormitory next to the Delhi railroad station in the old walled sector of the capital.\nShivering in the biting evening cold, hundreds of poor and ill-clad men, homeless and anonymous, slip every night into the warmth of a huge concrete dormitory next to the Delhi railroad station in the old walled sector of the capital.\nInside, they stand in lines to collect their quota of two blankets apiece from the dormitory supervisor and then look for a sleeping place.\nWhen they find a space that is unoccupied by a huddled, prostrate form, they quickly settle down, putting down their blankets and making themselves as comfortable as possible. They receive nothing else - no food or medical assistance.\nFor many poor but able-bodied men, it provides an alternative to sleeping in the open. Already, more than 100 people are reported to have died in a cold spell sweeping the plains of northern India. #5,000 People Every Night There are six such shelters run by the Delhi Development Authority, a sprawling Government construction concern in the capital. They take in about 5,000 people every night in the winter, although social workers familiar with the problem say this is only a fraction of the homeless population.\n''We have no families or homes in Delhi,'' said Ram Prasad, from the Garhwal district in the state of Uttar Pradesh. ''We come from far away to earn our living and, very often, until we find a steady job and a place to stay, we live in this shelter.''\nMr. Prasad, a cheerful, short man with a quick laugh, says he works as a cook.\nThe shelter is just off the main road that cuts across part of the walled city. Painted a Dirty Yellow\nBut the noise of the outside world is muted in the shelter, which is painted a dirty yellow outside and is open all year long. The air inside is thick with cigarette smoke and the murmur of conversation. The seekers of shelter are men working in the tiny restaurants of the city, rickshaw drivers, pushcart vendors, construction workers and some beggars, too.\nThey are young and old and come from around India, seeking hope and work. Some have deserted their families; others want to go back. They speak the many languages of this diverse land.\nA color television set entertains them, but most are too far away to see the programs clearly. A small group mostly of younger men sits before the set, watching with rapt attention as a bharat natyam dancer goes through her intricate paces.\nThere are lights that stay switched on throughout the night and grimy ceiling fans. There are no windows, only a series of ventilators and exhaust fans to let in fresh air. The burly, mustached guard at the gate says the door is never locked at night so that people can enter. 'No Drinking or Gambling'\n''Any poor person can come in, but we don't allow drinking, gambling or women,'' the guard, Ram Kanda, said.\nThe shelter near the railway station can take about 2,000 people and is the biggest in Delhi. There are other shelters, including places run by private agencies, but they are much smaller.\nAccording to Surrender Saini, the chief of the Bharat Sevak Samaj, a voluntary social welfare group, the shelters were begun in the 1950's when the Samaj took Jawaharlal Nehru around some of the workers colonies in the city. Nehru, the country's first Prime Minister, supported the idea of homes for the homeless.\nAt that time, Miss Saini said in an interview, the number of people who slept on Delhi's sidewalks was estimated at 100,000. That figure is believed to have increased by three times, social welfare experts say. Increasing Number of Shelters\nThe Delhi Development Authority is also increasing the number of shelters to take care of the influx of newcomers into the city from the countryside, who come in search of jobs and hopes of ''making it big,'' as Miss Saini says.\nMost of the homeless say they have few complaints. ''We get a place to sleep, and that is a blessing,'' said a man in black trousers and shirt, who identified himself as Satish Kumar. But Mr. Kumar, who talked with a visitor as a crowd gathered, said that they wanted cleaner toilets.\nHe also said sweepers would allow them the use of the toilet only if they were paid 25 paisa (about 2 cents) each time. ''That is not right, it is unjust,'' said Tapan Kumar, a youth.\nHe and others also said they were woken up around 6 A.M. and asked to leave, although the official closing time is 7 A.M. ''It is very cold at that time, and we don't get work until the markets open several hours later,'' said Mr. Kumar, who wore a scarf across his head.\nDelhi officials said they had not heard about the allegations.\nMr. Kumar, who is barely 18, left his home in Calcutta after a quarrel with his father eight years ago and has lived every night at the shelter.\nHe works as a helper at the messy, roadside cafes that proliferate here, but says he would now like to go back to Calcutta. ''I have never written to them, and they have never asked me to return,'' the youth said. ''But if I can save enough money, I will leave this place and go.''\nMost of those interviewed said they earned five to nine rupees every day (about 40 to 70 cents) if they got work.

The statue was toppled, and some nearby windows were shattered.\nIn the early morning darkness a few weeks ago, someone bombed a statue of Venustiano Carranza, the Mexican revolutionary hero. The statue was toppled, and some nearby windows were shattered.\nNo one took responsibility for the bombing, which caused no injuries, and the police have made no arrests. But the bombing of the statue has been seized upon by the political opposition as another example of why Mexico City must have its own elected government, rather than one appointed by national authorities.\nIn recent weeks, a coalition of four leftist parties and the country's single rightist party has led a campaign to transform the Federal District into a new state to be called Anahuac, with its own governor, legislature and judiciary, just as in Mexico's 31 other states.\nManuel Terrazas, the deputy representing the United Socialist Party, said the bombing was a warning of social unrest to come in Mexico City. He said that without truly representative government, the city's problems and social unrest would only grow worse.\nGiven the right to self-government, he said, the residents have ''the capacity to confront the city's problems and resolve them and develop their maximum capacity for creativity.''\nHe said Mexico City residents had not forgotten what they accomplished working together without Government interference in the days after the major earthquakes 16 months ago, when the authorities were overwhelmed and citizen volunteers rescued thousands of people trapped in buildings.\nMexico City, which is one of the world's largest cities with some 12 million people living within its boundaries and six million others living in the greater metropolitan area, has traditionally had little say in its own government. The President of Mexico appoints the mayor, the police chief, the city's attorney general and its judiciary.\nMexico City residents can vote in national elections for President and to name members of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate. But they cannot make their own laws, draw up the budget or decide the city's priorities as it tries to manage growth fueled by an unabated influx of people from the countryside.\nSeeking to defuse the growing opposition, the Government this week unveiled its own plan to bring more democracy to Mexico City, proposing to create a legislative assembly for the city. President Miguel de la Madrid sent the proposed legislation to the national Congress, which is overwhelmingly controlled by the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, thus assuring that the proposal will become reality.\nUnder the plan, the assembly would have 66 members elected by the residents of Mexico City, but would have no veto power over the mayor, who would continue to be a presidential appointee.\nIn his message proposing the legislation, Mr. de la Madrid ruled out any possibility of creating a new state, saying the seat of the Federal Government and an autonomous government for the Federal District could not co-exist because ''it would attack national unity and undermine the Federal pact.''\nUnder the Government's plan, the assembly would have 40 members from the PRI, as the governing party is known, and 26 from the opposition parties, even though in the last national election the ruling party won less than 50 percent of the total vote.\nOpposition politicians say ther opposition's political strength is the real reason that Federal authorities will never permit the Federal District its own government.\nMiguel Hernandez Labastida, a former member of the Chamber of Deputies representing the conservative National Action party, said: ''If Mexico City had its own government and there were honest elections, the minority parties would control the city, not the PRI. The government and its party will never permit that.''\nThe ruling party, which has dominated political life for 58 years, has been under increasing pressure in recent years to open up the political system to more democratic procedures.

An undetermined number of Cuban-Americans assist the rebels from Honduras, according to many sources here.\nEugene Hasenfus, an American cargo loader whose plane was shot down in Nicaragua and who was held prisoner by the Sandinistas, had described Mr. Rodriguez, who is sometimes known as Max Gomez, as a key contact in San Salvador. Statement Read on TV\n''My principal concern was the competence and the conduct of the key personnel who directed the supply network,'' said the Rodriguez statement, which was read by the lawyer, Fernando Mendigutia, on Spanish-language television here.\n''I never had any knowledge from where they were receiving funds, nor did I have control over the personnel of that group,'' Mr. Rodriguez said.\nHe said that he was recently interviewed by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that his statement to the F.B.I. was voluntary. The F.B.I. office in Miami had no comment.\nHe said his main reason for issuing his statement was to ''put in its proper perspective certain erroneous speculations'' that have appeared in the press concerning the role of Vice President Bush in the controversy surrounding the financing of the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras.\nAsked about the whereabouts of his client, Mr. Mendigutia said Mr. Rodriguez was in the United States. According to some of his friends, he recently had a hernia operation and is convalescing in the Miami area. Three Meetings With Bush\nMr. Rodriguez said he met with Mr. Bush three times - twice in Washington, on Jan. 22, 1985, and on May 1, 1986, and once ''briefly'' in Miami, on May 20, 1986. He added that ''at no point'' were the operations connected with the contras mentioned during these talks.\nMr. Rodriguez, who fought with United States forces in Vietnam, said he went to El Salvador on March 15, 1985, about two months after he first met with the Vice President.\nHe said his principal role in El Salvador was to ''try to implement a helicopter concept I developed in Vietnam to help the people of El Salvador eradicate the Communist insurgency.''\nHe added that statistics on fighting insurgency issued by the Salvadoran armed forces indicated the ''success of this concept'' and that the Reagan Administration, the Pentagon and Congress had been informed ''to this effect.''\nHe also denied that he ever discussed the contra operations with Donald P. Gregg, military adviser to the Vice President, or with other high aides to Mr. Bush, until Aug. 8, 1986, ''as described in the chronology of events released by the office of the Vice President.'' Explains Breaking of Silence\nIn his statement, Mr. Rodriguez emphasized that he had decided to ''break the professional code of silence'' because he became ''deeply concerned with inaccurate and repeated allegations in the media which appeared to doubt the truthfulness of what the Vice President and members of his staff have said.''\nHe did not clarify who introduced him to Mr. Bush, or the role of the Vice President or Mr. Gregg in his job in El Salvador, which was apparently to be a counterinsurgency consultant with the Salvadoran armed forces at Ilopango Air Base outside San Salvador.\nNeither did he say who was instrumental in his ''marginal involvement'' with the contra supply network at Ilopango.\nAccording to some of his friends, Mr. Rodriguez's job in El Salvador has ended because of the publicity surrounding his presence there.\n''He's an agent who had been burned out,'' a friend said. ''There is no way he can go back there now.'' HASENFUS TO MEET INVESTIGATORS\nMARINETTE, Wis., Jan. 3 (AP) -Eugene Hasenfus, who survived the crash of a rebel supply plane in Nicaragua, will meet here next week with Federal investigators, his attorney said today.\nThe lawyer, Ernest N. Pleger, said two F.B.I. agents would interview Mr. Hasenfus on Monday and Tuesday.\nA Customs Service official from Miami is also scheduled to meet with Mr. Hasenfus on Tuesday, Mr. Pleger said.\nHe said Mr. Hasenfus's information might be forwarded to Congressional committees for investigations into arms smuggling to Nicaraguan rebels.\nMr. Hasenfus, a 45-year-old former marine, was captured by Nicaragua on Oct. 6, the day after his plane was shot down. A Nicaraguan tribunal sentenced him to 30 years in prison for terrorism and other crimes, but he was pardoned Dec. 17 and released.

Among those present were Mr. Graham and Governor-elect Bob Martinez, a Republican, who is to be sworn in Tuesday as Florida's 40th Governor.\nThe new Governor's three-day administration will mark the pinnacle as well as the end of his political career.

Robertson encountered the first of the terminal cases recently in the slums of Muirhouse, and he estimated eight months of life were left to the despairing 21-year-old woman infected by her lover, a drug addict.\nDr. J. R. Robertson encountered the first of the terminal cases recently in the slums of Muirhouse, and he estimated eight months of life were left to the despairing 21-year-old woman infected by her lover, a drug addict.\nSo has this stolid city begun playing out one of the grislier aspects of Britain's initial encounter with the deadly disease called AIDS.\nAcquired immune deficiency syndrome has been on the streets of Edinburgh for only two years, but already it is rated at epidemic proportions by doctors who point to the peculiar group-sharing of heroin by the city's drug addicts as an enormously infectious factor.\nBecause a well-intentioned crackdown on drug paraphernalia forced the city's addicts to share dirty needles and syringes in recent years, the infection has hit rates far more exorbitant than anywhere else in the United Kingdom. The city had 7 out of 10 of Scotland's AIDS cases, as of November, and intravenous drug abusers here in the slums account for more than three of five of them. Spread of the Disease\n''We have leapfrogged the American experience with the gay community, which has had time to be better prepared,'' said Dr. Robertson. He was hardly crowing because the city's 1,200 infected drug abusers are spreading the disease, with 300 female partners and 25 newborn babies turning up as virus carriers.\nAt the same time, the Government has not yet acted on a recommendation of Scottish health experts that free clean needles and syringes be provided to the addicts to better contain the disease. Glasgow, with no similar needle ban, has twice as many drug abusers but they account for far fewer AIDS cases.\n''The gravity of the problem is such that on balance the containment of the spread of the virus is a higher priority in management than the prevention of drug misuse,'' the Scottish Committee on HIV Infection declared, cautioning that the disease was ''a serious threat to the general population.'' HIV is one name for the AIDS virus. Also known as HTLV-3 or LAV, the virus spreads through the blood supply, as on shared hypodermic needles, and through sexual intercourse.\nBeyond the organic illness, Edinburgh is experiencing a grinding combination of public bewilderment and press sensationalism. Camera crews arrive looking for deathbed tableaux, a phenomenon that is perhaps months away at the rate of AIDS infection. Filming of Addicts\nNeighborhood workers complain that at least one addict has been paid by television journalists to allow filming of his heroin injecting. Such melodramatic touches outrage medical professionals and social workers concerned about a public debate that at times veers toward such notions as forced national testing of immigrants or even the general population.\nThe British Government is preparing AIDS pamphlets to circulate nationally, even as its critics accuse it of underfunding research and overfocusing on the ''Tory morality'' of monogamy as a cure.\nAs the debate grows, replete with public-opinion polls of the healthy majority, doctors are trying to stretch limited resources to deal with the hundreds of illnesses and deaths they expect. Only six active cases of terminal AIDS illness were reported in all of Scotland toward the end of 1986, but doctors estimate this will soon begin growing at a rate of more than 140 a year.\nBritain has been behind larger parts of the world in experiencing the disease, and Dr. Robertson has visited the United States to take advantage of the four years' extra clinical and research work there. Tracking the Virus\nHe has spent the last year trying to track the virus and its carriers in the city, and he was not surprised at the grim milestone one evening in November in quietly diagnosing his first active case and terminally ill victim in the scores he has marked in the busy Muirfield drug community.\n''The public is going to panic,'' he said at his crowded public health medical practice, referring to the second wave of the problem, the actual illnesses and death that follow the initial alarm over the discovery of AIDS carriers.\n''Some of our bairns are sick, and we've got to help them,'' a Scotsman proud of his homosexuality said at a recent public debate that was heated as speakers complained that the Government had engaged in too little research and too much stigmatization of the victims.\nSome contrasted the AIDS concern with the relative unconcern over the 100,000 annual deaths in Britain related to cigarette smoking. Most were incensed by the view of a city councilman, Tony Lester, who said the AIDS threat was equivalent to the war against Nazi Germany and those infected should be forced onto an island. Against Homosexuality\n''Recriminalize homosexuality,'' he proposed, along with quarantining all addicts and banning all African immigrants.\nHooting him in the back of the room was Heather Black, a social worker born in the Muirfield slum who runs Self Help Advice on Drug Addiction, a busy private agency in the neighborhood on the fringe of the city.\nShe was furious that views such as Mr. Lester's have drawn so much attention when, she said, the long-festering conditions underlying addicition such as poverty, joblessness and a six-year wait for public housing draw little interest and insufficient Government efforts.\n''There's loads of other problems intertwined,'' she said, describing gray-haired residents who have never had work and have been on the dole all their lives. ''Youth unemployment here is running over 45 percent. The central Government has never done anything about the heroin, why should we expect something from them over AIDs?'' 'Bereavement Training' Classes\nSimilar complaints are being voiced at other drug treatment centers such as The Leith Group on Henderson Street, where workers say they are taking classes in ''bereavement training'' to prepare for the expected terminal illnesses from AIDS.

And so its 2.5 million citizens - an ethnic mix of Chinese, Malay, Indian and European - have grown accustomed to Mr. Lee's propensity for poking into all corners of their lives. He is at it again. With Singapore reaching the living standards of Western Europe, the Prime Minister, who was educated in Britain, is concerned that the country is losing some of its Asian cultural bearings.\nConfucian principles should guide public life, he said in a recent interview at his official residence. He is worried about the unsettling effects of Western individualism on an Eastern society.\nBut at home, he said, it is time for men to abandon their Asian preference for submissive women. He thinks the wrong people - the least educated in a society with widespread educational opportunity - are having the children. University-educated women have their minds on careers.\nAt a recent student forum, a young woman asked Mr. Lee, 63 years old, why he was ''hounding'' female graduates to have babies. He replied that maybe it was a mistake to give Singaporean women so much equality.\n''I was in my 30's when we made that decision,'' he told his questioner. He and his wife, the former Kwa Geok Choo, competed for top honors at Cambridge University.\n''My wife was educated,'' he said. ''There was no trouble. Proceed!'' ''It was a ghastly mistake,'' he said.\nDoes that mean he wants to reverse policies that made Singapore's women Asia's most privileged? Will he restore polygamy, as many women fear?\n''We can't go back,'' he said in the interview. Instead, a radically new trend could be coming: educated but unmarried women having children and raising them as single parents. He called it ''the next step down the road that the Western woman has taken.'' ''I don't welcome it,'' he added. ''The problem is a male problem,'' he said. ''It's a problem of a male cultural lag. Sterotypical Chinese family, the woman can't be seen to be wearing the pants.''\nHe recalled that when the Government set up one of its publicized singles cruises last year to bring professional young people together ''50 women signed up - and 3 men.'' Men were not interested in graduate women, he said.\nMr. Lee said one of his toughest jobs in making a nation out of Singapore was building a common language. The city-state, which got limited self-rule in 1959, joined an ill-fated federation of Malaysia in 1963 and became independent on its own two years later.\n''People wanted to keep their own languages,'' he said. ''We speak at least five major languages. If you include the dialects, there will be about 20.''\n''So I had to knock a lot of heads to keep the language chauvinists in check,'' he said. Though parents were allowed some choice, he said, children will learn English in school, ''so that across the races, we will use English.''\nHe said he was immeasurably aided in building the nation by the Confucian roots of its Chinese majority.\n''Looking back over the last 30 years, one of the driving forces that made Singapore succeed was that the majority of the people placed the importance of the welfare of society above the individual, which is a basic Confucianist concept,'' Mr. Lee said.\nThis provided ''a certain social cohesion that enables us to avoid the industrial strife that has plagued so many countries, even developing ones, before there are many fruits to distribute.''\n''One of the sharpest distinctions between an American way of resolving disputes and a Chinese or Japanese or Korean or Vietnamese way,'' he said, ''is the belief you have that you can resolve all disputes by slamming each other with points and counterpoints, and you get the truth revealed and everything is resolved.''\n''There is no such fundamental faith in this method of resolving conflicts in Confucianist societies,'' he said. ''Hence, the remarkably few lawyers they have, even in Japan, as compared to American societies.''

While last year's sale of 3,900 units represented an increase of almost 3 percent, a combination of factors has created what industry experts like to refer to as a ''soft'' market.\nAMERICAN builders of auxiliary sailboats are facing 1987 with cautious optimism. While last year's sale of 3,900 units represented an increase of almost 3 percent, a combination of factors has created what industry experts like to refer to as a ''soft'' market.\nCompetition is stiff. The entry of more small-volume builders has fragmented the market, and the rising popularity of foreign-built boats, especially those from France and Taiwan, have rendered near moribund the growth industry of the 1970's.\nSome observers think the surge in powerboat sales, aided in part by the oil glut, has hurt sailing. In any event, the soft market has meant Chapter 11 for more than one builder.\nBut American builders are fighting back. Despite some criticism that the industry lacks imagination and has failed to induce younger generations into buying entry-level boats, surviving builders are cutting costs and struggling to develop appealing new images.\nMost sailboat exhibitors at the New York Boat Show are large-production yards, building from 100 to 1,000 units per year. But size isn't necessarily a requisite of financial health. C&C Yachts of Canada, one of North America's largest builders, last year filed for protection under bankruptcy laws. The New owners have reduced the number of models to its most popular club racers and family cruisers. The C&C 35 will be displayed at the show.\nOther builders are developing new strategies to combat sluggish sales. Starcraft Sailboat Products, the division of Lear Siegler that builds Cal and O'Day sailboats, has adopted details of European styling on its new O'Day 302 and 322. Large tinted plexiglass portlights, a feature borrowed from the French builders, give a space age look. A wing keel, popularized by the 12-meter Australia II, gives shoal draft with superior upwind performance. The aft double berth, which just five years ago was considered unthinkable in a 30-footer, is now standard. The O'Day 302 sells in the ''low 40's'' according to Leslie Lindeman, director of marketing for Starcraft.\nPearson Yachts of Portsmouth, R.I., is one of the country's largest and oldest builders of auxiliary sailboats. Sold by Grumman Allied last year to a South Carolina businessman, Pearson will unveil its Pearson 27 at the New York show. Priced at $30,000 with a 12-horsepower diesel engine, the P 27 has six-foot head room, an unusual U-shaped dinette forward, a wing keel and, of course, a double berth aft under the cockpit.\nGreg Wiley, mechanical-systems director for Sabre Yachts in South Casco, Me., feels his company has expanded the appeal of its two most recent models by giving them racier looks.\n''They've given us a real shot in the arm and opened the market for us,'' said Wiley. ''We had a traditional reputation, but our typical buyer now is younger, and they're looking for quality but with contemporary styling.'' Citing statistics that indicate 75 percent of the buying public is interested in the 30- to 40-foot range, Wiley said the company dropped its 28-footer and in the future will not build boats smaller than 30 feet. The Sabre 42 will be exhibited at the show; it carries a base price of $148,800.\nAmerica's second-largest builder of auxiliary sailboats (after Catalina) is Hunter Marine of Alachua, Fla. While president Warren Luhrs campaigns his 60-foot Thursday's Child in the B.O.C. Challenge singlehanded, round-the-world race, the company will display its Hunter 28, Legendek 35 and 37 and Hunter 40 at the show. Noted for innovation and value, Hunter has made aggressive efforts to win a large share of the market.\nCruise Pack extras such as VHF radio, digital instruments and lifejackets are standard equipment. New on the Legende 37 is the standard Fun Pac, which includes a video player, television and stereo. The company's national sales manager, Richard Ash, said the boat also has flush skylights and a walk-through transom that is molded into the deck rather than the hull. Its price is $85,000.\nWith the passing of the veteran designer Carl Alberg, Cape Dory Yachts of East Taunton, Mass., is seeking to update its line of conservative, full-keel cruisers. Clive Dent drew the lines for the Cape Dory 30 Mark II and 300 MS, base-priced at $62,900 and $69,995. By painful staff cutting and paying closer attention to production costs, President Andy Vavolotis is pulling up his company's bootstraps. The 30-foot motor sailer has been particularly successful, especially appealing to older couples along the East Coast. And the 300 Mark II is up to hull No. 10 with more orders waiting.\nMore than two dozen sailboat builders will exhibit at the New York Boat Show, including Hobie Cat Freedom Yachts and Tartan Marine. Pacific Seacraft of Santa Ana, Calif., will show its handsome vest-pocket cruiser in the Dana 24. Billed as a world cruiser, it sells for $45,900.\nBristol Yachts of Bristol, R.I., is showing a Bristol 45.5, a luxury center- or aft-cockpit cruiser. And Ericson Yachts of Irvine, Calif., one of the last major production yards still located in Southern California, is showing its new Bruce King-designed Ericson 34.\nPredating all these builders Is Alcort Sailboats Inc. The Waterbury, Conn., builder of small fun boats plans to show the public three sketches of its 40th anniversary Sunfish. Persons may cast their votes for the best graphic scheme and may win a Heritage Edition Sunfish in a boat-show drawing.\nFirst built of wood in 1946, the Sunfish has undergone many subtle changes over the years, but, like the Volkswagen Beetle, its enduring appeal is its simplicity and sameness. For those without the inclination or cash to buy a large auxiliary sailboat, the $1,445 Sunfish is a great way to get afloat.

When the Emperor of Russia sailed his boat on the IJssel, other craft would accost him. In a fury he drove away a mail-boat by throwing empty bottles at the captain's head, an unusual form of naval warfare.\nLast year, General Romadonovsky had a similar problem in the City of Atlanta. The General, or rather the actor who played that role in the television miniseries ''Peter the Great,'' was surrounded by women while competing in the National Swiss Teams at the American Contract Bridge League's Fall Nationals.\nThese were not kibitzers interested in the bidding and play, but fans anxious to get as close as possible to Omar Sharif. He resisted the temptation to react in the violent manner of his Emperor, but eventually ventured a mild protest: ''Ladies, I have posed for photographs and signed autographs for you. But I came here to play bridge and I'd be grateful if you would allow my teammates to reach the table so that I can find out whether we have qualified for tomorrow's play.''\nThere was some evidence to suggest that the unfavorable circumstances had an impact on Sharif's technical performance. On the diagramed deal he spotted an unusual play too late.\nAs South he had a problem when his partner opened one no-trump, showing 15-17 points, and East overcalled two hearts. He needed a way to invite game in spades, which can be done with the Lebensold convention: two no-trump, requiring three clubs with three spades to follow. As this convention was not in the partnership repertoire he had to jump to three spades, a slight overbid.\nThe contract was not a good one, with three top losers and problems in both minor suits, but it was far from hopeless after the lead of the heart jack. The heart king was marked with East, so South won with the ace in dummy. He cashed the king and ace of spades and led a club, won by East's king.\nThe shift was to a diamond, and Sharif cleared his first hurdle in fine style by playing the queen. He judged correctly that West held the ace and jack, so it was important to prevent a diamond continuation. Playing any other diamond would have been fatal, for West would have covered to force the king, and the road would have been open for the defense to take four tricks.\nWest took the ace and led a club, won by East and producing this position after a diamond lead to dummy's king:\nSouth now pinned his hopes on scoring the club ten as well as the queen, which would permit him to discard a diamond from the dummy. This play led to defeat, and he later apologized for missing an unusual possibility.\n''If I had led the heart queen in the six-card ending,'' he suggested, ''I would have forced West to protect hearts and caught him in a triple squeeze.''\nHis expert teammates accepted the apology and failed to come to his analytical rescue. As he saw later, the squeeze is an illusion: West can throw a diamond if South leads one trump, and can afford to unguard any suit if the last trump is led.\nSharif did not consider blaming his gallery of intrusive fans for his slight post-mortem error. But one can hope that fans will be more considerate if, as is likely, he plays in New York late in 1987 during the Broadway run of ''Interpreters.'' Perhaps the solution is to avoid advance publicity, of his play rather than the play; but that did not help Peter the Great.\nBRIDGE
732	THE MARSHALL SWINDLE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D71138F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A ''Marshall swindle'' or just plain ''swindle'' is not a kind of cheating or a contravening of the rules of the game. The word connotes a diabolically clever move or combination that turns the tables on the opponent.\nA ''Marshall swindle'' or just plain ''swindle'' is not a kind of cheating or a contravening of the rules of the game. The word connotes a diabolically clever move or combination that turns the tables on the opponent.\nFrank Marshall often played a game in a lazy or relaxed style that ceded his opponent the advantage. Yet, counter to expectation, the United States champion from 1909 to 1936 didn't lose all of these. Just when he appeared to be in a totally lost position, he would summon up a marvelous tactical flight of fancy to smash his unaware opponent.\nSome of his defeated and frustrated opponents, believing that they had a moral right to the victory after having established decisive advantage, felt that Marshall had cheated them out of their just deserts. They - an often enraged David Janowski led these unfortunates - pitifully screamed that they had been swindled.\nBut, as Yogi Berra has trenchantly observed, ''The game isn't over 'til it's over.''\nOn the current American scene, the player who best wears the mantle of Marshall is Kamran Shirazi, a 34-year-old Beverly Hills international master originally from Iran. In the 1986 United States championship, Shirazi was awarded the Craig Crenshaw prize for the best swindle for his ninth-round game against Grandmaster Nick DeFirmian of Oakland, Calif.\nIt was probably coincidental that Shirazi chose the Petrov Defense, but this nevertheless was a great favorite of Marshall. Moreover, instead of the modern method of development with 6 ... B-K2 or 6 ... N-QB3, Shirazi reverted to Marshall's old 6 ... B-Q3, which had long been under a cloud but is now being looked into again.\nYears ago the late Paul Keres recommended 9 Q-B2 but the truth is that the gambit with 9 ... N-R3!; 10 BxN, PxB; 11 QxP, R-K1 yields Black a powerful initiative.\nThis game was copying one played by Bozidar Ivanovic and Alexander Khalifman in last year's Plovdiv, Bulgaria, International Tournament up to the point where Ivanovic retreated with 13 B-K2. DeFirmian diverged with the superior 13 B-Q3.\nAfter 13 ... N-Q2; 14 P-KR3, B-R4; 15 B-K4, Shirazi should have played 15 ... R-B1; 16 P-QR4, P-QR3; 17 Q-Q3, B-N3, with only a slight superiority for White. Instead, he carelessly played 15 ... Q-B2? (Marshall occasionally nodded, too) and was struck by 16 BxPch!\nSince 16 ... KxB; 17 N-N5ch, K-N3; 18 P-N4 is very strong for White, Shirazi had to acquiesce in the loss of a pawn with 16 ... K-R1.\nBefore Black could get an attack going, DeFirmian forced a relaxation of the tension with 20 N-N5! The upshot, after 25 ... B-Q3, was that Shirazi was a pawn down with nothing to show for it.\nAfter 26 QxKP, he could not play 26 ... RxP?, which would have allowed 27 Q-R4ch. And since there was no chance to save the game by mincing play, he threw everything, with 26 ... Q-B2, into the sort of wide-open tactical game that Marshall loved.\nAfter 27 QxP, Q-N3, DeFirmian's objective was to consolidate his great material advantage. He could have accomplished this with 28 R-N2! because 28 ... R-K1 can be answered by 29 B-Q2!, but not by 29 B-K3?!, RxB!; 30 PxR, Q-N6!, which forces White to take perpetual check with 31 Q-K8ch, K-R2; 32 Q-R5ch, K-N1; 33 Q-K8ch, and so on.\nInstead, he played 28 RxP? and permitted 28 ... RxP. He thought to bail out with 29 Q-R8ch, R-B1; 30 R-N5, but Shirazi unleashed the marvelous Marshall masher, 30 ... Q-K5!, and the game was over.\nSince 31 QxQ allows 31 ... R-B8mate, DeFirmian gave up.\nCHESS

Wilson, wherein she called for mandatory sex education in the schools. She maintains that by doing so, we will be providing a service that addresses the growing problem of teen-age pregnancies, abortions, AIDS, etc.\nAlthough Ms. Wilson is well-intentioned, I suspect that her ideas will not resolve the problem in the areas cited, not because young people are ignorant but because of the destruction of long-held and now-discarded moral values.\nMs. Wilson seems to think that the answer lies in teaching children as young as the kindergarten level about all manner of heterosexual and homosexual activities and the precautions necessary to guarantee safety from disease. The function of our school system should be to teach basic skills (e.g., the three ''R's'' and good citizenship).\nSocial services and sex education are not the answers to a very complex problem that has a rather simple solution if only parents, teachers, religious leaders and social planners had either the brains or the guts to implement it. And that is that promiscuity and ''Great Society'' social programs have been a dismal failure.\nOn another note, one must ask why was it necessary for Ms. Wilson to identify the New Jersey Catholic Conference in her article? There is no question but that kicking the Catholic Church is a popular participatory sport of people on the left.\nThe family is the basic unit of society. It would seem that the purpose of this latest ''necessary'' program is to break up families before they have a chance to form. ANDREW J. MAC DONALD\nFanwood

737	A PLEA TO DENY BAIL IF A VIOLENT CRIME IS COMMITTED	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDE1E38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: BEING the victim of a violent crime like rape, assault or armed robbery is an experience that is at once angering and frightening.\nBEING the victim of a violent crime like rape, assault or armed robbery is an experience that is at once angering and frightening.\nImagine your reaction if you found out that the person who raped or beat you was out on bail for a similar violent crime.\nIt is precisely this situation that has led to the concept of preventive detention: detaining the most violent kind of criminal to prevent him from committing a crime while out on bail.\nTo invoke preventive detention, however, a court must be persuaded at a hearing (held within 72 hours of the defendant's arrest) that there is a ''substantial probability'' the defendant committed the crime he stands accused of, and that there is ''clear and convincing evidence'' that the defendant will almost certainly commit a violent crime if allowed bail.\nThen, and only then, can the court hold that person until he or she is tried within 90 days.\nSince we know that a significant percentage of violent crime is committed by people out on bail, there can be little doubt that preventive detention will lessen the incidence of crime.\nBut by detaining people accused of a violent crime are we not breaking down the principle that people are innocent until proved guilty? Are we not weakening our State Constitution?\nOn the contrary, preventive detention for violent crime is only extending a principle, already embodied in our Constitution, that allows for a person accused of a capital crime, like murder, to be held without bail. Consider this situation: A man savagely beats and rapes a victim. The victim dies, the prosecutor seeks the death penalty and the judge invokes preventive detention, as the Constitution allows.\nNow let's say that the man savagely beats and rapes a victim, but the victim, instead of dying, lapses into a coma. The judge in this case cannot now invoke preventive detention, even if he is sure that the defendant will commit another crime while out on bail.\nOf course, the judge could impose a high bail, which is often done. But why should a judge have to resort to the hypocrisy of high bail - in effect, creating preventive detention - when this tool of legitimate preventive detention can be made available? Besides, a bail set can mean a bail met. Suppose the court, having no doubt whatsoever that the defendant will commit another serious and violent crime while out on bail, sets a high bail in an effort to keep the defendant off the streets?\nBut the defendant is well-off or has rich friends and meets the bail. The court has no recourse but to release him. The court is handcuffed by the law. I've already alluded to some of the safeguards against abuse in a bill, of which I am the chief sponsor. The measure has already passed the Assembly and is now before the State Senate. Let me be more specific. First, preventive detention can be employed only if the defendant is charged with murder, aggravated manslaughter, rape, kidnapping, armed robbery or aggravated arson, or if he has been convicted of one of these crimes within the last 10 years.\nAll of these are first-degree crimes, the most serious offenses that our state recognizes.\nIf the crime was committed while the defendant was out on bail, he can also be held because the judge may decide that the person doesn't have much regard for the rules of bail. Also, if a defendant is brought before the court because he has threatened a witness or juror, the court may decide that the health of the witness or juror may depend on preventive detention.\nIn addition, the court must conduct a hearing within 72 hours to determine if the person should be released with certain conditions, like bail. For the court to deny bail and order preventive detention, it must be persuaded that a substantial probability exists that the defendant committed the crime that has brought him before the court.\nFurther, the court must be satisfied by ''clear and convincing evidence'' - that is, evidence of the highest order - that ''there is no condition or combination of conditions of release that will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the community.''\nIn other words, only when the court is absolutely convinced that releasing this person will almost certainly lead to a violent crime's being committed can the person be held without bail.\nMoreover, anyone held under preventive detention must be tried within 90 days; that is, people held under preventive detention are guaranteed a speedy trial. A person who simply could not make a high bail may not be tried that swiftly.\nThe conditions set for meeting preventive detention are difficult, and should be. But if the court needs to use this power, if the court is sure that the defendant is someone who, given half a chance, will go out and commit a heinous crime, then the judge has this tool of preventive detention to use.\nPreventive detention is supported by people of every political stripe -from Governor Kean to Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.\nAnd why not? After all, there are sufficient safeguards in preventive detention to make sure that the constitution is protected. And there are sufficient provisions in preventive detention to make sure that the public is safe.\nThe only ones whose security is threatened by preventive detention are the most violent and brutal criminals. And they have been secure long enough.\nOPINION

At present, a developer need only obtain the permission of the host municipality to build an office complex or shopping center. Sometimes, the developer may be forced to pay for some road improvement in the immediate area, such as an overpass to serve a complex.\nBut the state is saying that is no longer enough. The increased traffic caused by new developments is turning some major arteries into virtual parking lots during rush hours - the U.S. 1 corridor between New Brunswick and Princeton is a case in point - and some state officials are convinced the solutions are far more complex and expensive than localized improvements can handle.\nThe Kean administration wants the Legislature to pass a three-bill package creating something called Transplan. It would:\n* Strengthen county control over regional development.\n* Give the state new powers to control access to state highways.\n* Assess developers a fee to help pay for needed improvements.\nHazel Frank Gluck, the state's Commissioner of Transportation, told the Senate Transportation Committee at a recent hearing:\n''We are in very real danger of strangling in our own success. It does not have to happen that way. The forces that are changing our landscape are not wild forces of nature beyond our control.\n''It is up to us to decide whether we will plan for the future, or merely allow events to overwhelm us. It is up to us to decide whether development will be an engine of prosperity or a long-term drain on the resources of state and local government.''\nMrs. Gluck said that the state had attracted new companies because of its location and accessibility, but that if it was unable to plan for long-term regional transportation needs.\n''We risk having our transportation system swamped with traffic, degrading the quality of life and sapping our economic vitality,'' she said.\nTraffic professionals, Mrs. Gluck said, use a rating systems to describe the ''levels of service'' that road systems provide. The system goes from ''A'' to ''F,'' with an ''A'' describing a road in Iowa ''where you can drive for miles and never see another car,'' and an ''F'' referring to a ''virtual parking lot.''\nNew Jersey does not have any ''A'' roads, the Commissioner said, but does have some ''E's'' -those at or near capacity - and that some people would argue that U.S. 1, especially during rush hours, is an ''F.''

But two diner buffs who grew up in Roslyn, Donald Kaplan and Alan Bellink, have memorialized these eateries in ''Classic Diners of the Northeast,'' an illustrated guidebook describing 75 vintage diners where you can still order a blue-plate special or a heaping pile of pancakes served with a smile and some friendly chatter.\n''I'm a diner person by night - it's in my genes,'' said Mr. Bellink, a music executive at ABC, who went to high school with Mr. Kaplan. ''My father, a cantor, was a diner buff - he would take me to the Roslyn Diner for a big Sunday breakfast where they served the biggest, best baking-soda biscuits I can remember.\n''In high school, the diner was the premier place for male adolescents to hang out. Don and I would go there three or four times a week after school and on Saturday nights, with or without dates.''\nBoth men went their independent ways after school, but they remained friends and continued to haunt diners on every occasion. About 10 years ago, they decided to collaborate on a book.\n''I always loved diners - there was something about their marble counters and slanting roofs that was really fascinating,'' said Mr. Kaplan, who works in real estate and is also a writer. ''You could always interact with the community and be yourself and eat good food. One day, Alan called and said he wanted to write a book about diners, and we teamed up.''\nAfter getting a contract, they spent six months in the New York Public Library, looking up every diner in the Northeast in the Yellow Pages. They finally selected 250 that seemed to be authentic and spent the next six months on the road, visiting diners, sampling their food and talking to the owners and patrons.\n''For many, we needed a handy supply of Alka-Seltzer,'' Mr. Bellink said. ''Some owners were suspicious and thought we were spies from a fast-food chain. But most were happy to be included, and we finally made our selection on the basis of three criteria: architectural purity, the quality of the food and the friendliness of the workers and patrons.''\nBut when the book was published in 1980, vintage diners were on the wane and the book didn't catch on. Shortly after, a spate of popular movies -''Diner,'' ''Broadway Danny Rose,'' ''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' - made diners hot stuff again. This fall, Faber & Faber decided to reissue the book. A second printing is in the works. The book contains not only an illustrated description of each diner, but also a preface explaining the history of these ''railroad'' eateries. Most vintage diners were built between 1920 and 1940, when the expansion of highways and the increase in automobiles set up a need for roadway restaurants where the service was fast and cheap.\nUnlike the imitation diners manufactured in recent decades, vintage diners were made in a factory, in the style of railroad cars, and shipped to a site that already contained plumbing and wiring. Often the diners came equipped with dishes, silverware and wall menus, and were ready to operate in a number of hours.\nThe grill was always in the front, in full view of the customers, who often sat on bar stools at the counter and traded gossip and one-liners with the grill man or the waitresses. Because they were open all night, many became gathering places for truck drivers and shift workers who liked their long hours and cheap prices.\nThey also became hangouts for high school students who could spend their loose change and idle hours there, sipping on soda and munching on french fries.\n''Long Island is covered with diner restaurants with neon signs and huge menus,'' Mr. Bellink said, ''but most of them aren't authentic. Since they resurfaced the exterior of the Roslyn Diner, we had to exclude it. With the exception of the Empire Diner in Manhattan, we decided only to include vintage diners.''\nOne of the Long Island diners described in the book is Duffy's Diner (now renamed Jen & Lil's) in Center Moriches, which was built in the 1920's. Most of the customers are old-timers or charter fishermen who come in for breakfast after an outing on Sheepshead Bay.\nEven though the inside has been repapered with yellow and gold wallpaper, there is an original barreled ceiling, a characteristic of many diners. The diner offers meat loaf, roast beef and ham roast specials, adorned with potatoes, vegetables, bread, butter and coffee. But it is most famous for its huge sandwiches, served with potatoes and coleslaw.\nThe Marybill Diner in Merrick, a block from the Long Island Rail Road station, is another vintage eatery, dating from 1949. Built by Silk City, a major diner manufacturing concern, it has barreled ceilings slanting down at both ends to give the effect of a train car, sliding doors, and the original open glass sugar bowls and white porcelain Hamilton Beach malt machine. While all the food is freshly prepared, the diner is most noted for its omelets.\nOther Long Island diners of note that could not be included in the book because of lack of space are Dave's Diner in Cutchogue, the Westhampton Beach Diner and the Blue Point Diner.\nVintage diners are also distinctive because of their authentic regional dishes and their limited menus. For example, New England diners serve fresh fish and a boiled dinner on Thursday consisting of corned beef and cabbage. In central New York, chicken and dumplings are often featured. And in southern New Jersey, vinegar is often served with french fries.\n''America is having a love affair with diners,'' Mr. Bellink said. ''They offer a homey, personal touch that we miss and need today. Whenever I see a bottle of ketchup on the table, I can relax.''

Aquino's Government was a dictatorship, and he urged voters to reject a draft constitution.\nJuan Ponce Enrile, who was dismissed in November as Defense Minister, said today that President Corazon C. Aquino's Government was a dictatorship, and he urged voters to reject a draft constitution.\nMrs. Aquino has been campaigning for approval of the charter in a plebiscite scheduled for Feb. 2. The document was drafted by an Aquino-appointed commission, and Government officials and independent commentators have described the referendum as a vote of confidence in her Government.\nThe draft charter would confer on Mrs. Aquino a six-year term ending June 30, 1992. It would bar her from seeking re-election.\nSupporters of the former President, Ferdinand E. Marcos, and the leadership of the country's largest and most militant labor federation, the May First Movement, earlier announced opposition to the charter, which would replace the 1973 Constitution that Mrs. Aquino abrogated after taking power from Mr. Marcos last February in a civilian-military uprising.\n''We reject the draft constitution because the Government sponsoring it is a dictatorship,'' Mr. Enrile said, adding that if the charter was rejected, Mrs. Aquino ''will not be able to govern.''\n''The people will demand her resignation,'' he said.\nMrs. Aquino addressed rallies in the southeastern Luzon cities of Legaspi and Naga today, where she said the new constitution would bring political stability and economic recovery. Both cities are considered Aquino strongholds, but the crowds were smaller than had been forecast by local officials.\nIn another development, Communist rebels accused Washington of interfering in this nation's peace process and said they could find no common ground with the Government for formal negotiations set to begin Tuesday.\nThe National Democratic Front, which has been negotiating on behalf of the Communist rebels, made public a letter to the Government today saying the Government's approach to the talks was limited to inducing the rebels to surrender.\nBut Saturnino Ocampo, a rebel leader, said at a news conference that he was still confident that the two sides could reach agreement on an agenda for the peace talks. A 60-day cease-fire began on Dec. 10.
742	STUDY, DRAWING LESSONS FOR U.S., CITES RIGOR OF JAPANESE SCHOOLING	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DC1E38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In an unusual official look at another country's school system, the United States Department of Education has linked Japan's economic success to the rigor and efficiency of its primary and secondary schools.\nIn an unusual official look at another country's school system, the United States Department of Education has linked Japan's economic success to the rigor and efficiency of its primary and secondary schools.\nThe department, in a study entitled ''Japanese Education Today'' that was made public yesterday, described Japan as a ''learning society of formidable dimensions,'' adding that the ties between schools and the job market there were ''closer and more effective than in most other industrialized nations.'' High Scores for Various Reasons\nA parallel study of American education was released simultaneously in Tokyo by Japan's Ministry of Education, Science and Culture. [ Page 10. ] The two countries' studies grew out of conversations in November 1983 between President Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who agreed that the two countries would benefit from the study of each other's school systems.\nThe Education Department's 111-page study, written by specialists in comparative education, noted that Japanese students consistently scored highly on international tests of educational achievement.\nReasons for the high average level of achievement, the scholars said, included well-defined curriculums, close parental involvement in children's education, the high social and economic status conferred on classroom teachers and the ''hard work'' that students devote to their education. 'Implemented on Grand Scale'\n''None of these are surprises,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., the Assistant Secretary whose office supervised the study. ''Our own research has identified principles of effective education. The difference is that in Japan you see them implemented on a grand scale.''\nThe report cites two important assumptions that underlie Japanese education: ''One is that virtually all children have the ability to learn well and to master the regular school curriculum. The second is that certain habits and characteristics, such as diligence and attention to detail, can be taught.''\nWhile praising the overall achievement of Japanese students, the scholars said Japanese political and business leaders were deeply disturbed over deficiencies in their system, including the failure of primary and secondary schools to develop ''creativity'' in their students. Problems in Higher Education\nMoreover, they cited ''widespread agreement'' that higher education in Japan ''is not a world-class educational system.'' Colleges and universities in Japan are characterized by poor teaching and light academic demands by faculty members, the report said.\nThe first two years of college especially, the scholars said, ''have become a relaxed period during which students frequently cut classes'' and ''devote much of their time to clubs and other pleasurable activities that they had to forgo during the grueling period in upper secondary school when they were preparing for university admission.''\nThe study noted that ''education reform'' was a major political issue in both countries, but it said that, in light of cultural and educational differences between the two countries, the movements to improve schools were going in ''opposite directions.''\n''Education reformers in Japan are seeking some decentralization of control, greater diversification of institutions, less uniformity and standardization of curriculum, more flexibility in teaching and more individualization of instruction,'' the scholars said.\n''Americans already have state and local control, great diversity in education programs at elementary and secondary levels and an open, diversified higher education system,'' they continued. Consequently, they said, ''most serious American reformers are now seeking a greater measure of commonality in the curriculum and higher academic standards for all.'' Sponsored by Joint Program\nThe studies, which took two years to complete, were conducted under the general sponsorship of the United States-Japan Conference on Cultural and Educational Interchange, a forum of government officials and leaders of the private sector devoted to fostering cooperation between the two countries.\nIn both cases, teams of scholars made extensive visits to schools.\nThe Americans' study includes a comprehensive description of Japanese schools, from the generally modest physical facilities to the competitive environment that surrounds the examinations that students take to gain entrance to the best high schools and, subsequently, the most prestigious universities.\nThe study also describes privately run schools, or ''jukus,'' that many Japanese students attend to supplement what they learn in the public schools.\nThe scholars, in showing the relatively high status of teachers in Japanese society, say there are five applicants for every position. Commitment That Starts Early\nAlthough the fiercely competitive examination system has its ''negative aspects,'' the examinations also make some ''positive contributions'' to the overall educational process, the scholars said.\n''They buttress academic standards and foster achievement throughout precollegiate education,'' the report said. Moreover, it said, since preparation for examinations requires ''sustained commitment and hard work,'' Japanese students from a very young age ''learn values that will serve them well as the move into the labor force and adult life.''\nIn an epilogue to the research paper entitled ''Implications for American Education,'' Secretary of Education William J. Bennett rejected the argument of some educators that the homogeneity of Japanese people and other cultural differences between the two nations made it difficult to ''distill lessons for ourselves from the experience of Japanese education.''\nFor one thing, he said, Japanese schools have been ''demonstrably successful'' in providing their nation with capable workers and a broadly literate population. For another, many aspects of Japanese schools can be traced in part to American influences in the post-World War II occupation period, such as their success in balancing the goals of equality and excellence. What Makes Effective Schools\n''Our educational ideals are better realized on a large scale in Japan than observers have tended to realize,'' he wrote. ''Much of what seems to work well for Japan in the field of education closely resembles what works best in the United States - and most likely elsewhere. Good education is good education.''\nMr. Bennett said that in reading the scholars' report he had been struck by how much the salient characteristics of Japanese schools coincided with the qualities that American educational researchers associated with effective schools.\nThese include a ''well-ordered and purposeful learning environment,'' clearly defined goals, coherent curriculums and high expectations for students, he said.\n''Leaving aside special schools and programs in the U.S., the Japanese generally seem to expect a level of performance that is closer to children's true intellectual capacities than Americans ordinarily do,'' he said. ''More remarkably, they adhere to these standards for virtually all youngsters, never supposing that one or another category or sub-population cannot accomplish as much as everybody else.'' How to Obtain Copies\nThe American study of Japanese schools was directed by Robert Leestma, an international specialist within the Department of Education who assembled a group of academic experts on the subject. They were Robert L. August, Lois Peak, Betty George, Nobuo Shimahara, William K. Cummings and Nevzer G. Stacey.\nThe study is to be published Saturday by the Government Printing Office. Information about obtaining copies can be obtained grom Japanese Education Today, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Washington, D.C. 20208.\nA volume of scholarly papers generated by the study is to be published this year.\nThe Japanese researchers' study of American education has not yet been translated into English.
743	MATTINGLY PREPARING FOR MORE HARDBALL WITH STEINBRENNER	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDC1E38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: DON MATTINGLY recently received an envelope in the mail from the Yankees. It contained a contract for 1987. The contract included a proposed salary for 1987 -$1,375,000, the same numbers that filled the blank in paragraph two of his 1986 contract.\nDON MATTINGLY recently received an envelope in the mail from the Yankees. It contained a contract for 1987. The contract included a proposed salary for 1987 -$1,375,000, the same numbers that filled the blank in paragraph two of his 1986 contract.\n''They offered me no raise,'' Mattingly said. ''I just figured they figured my play wasn't worth a raise.''\nThe Yankees didn't quite figure that about Mattingly, who almost by acclamation is considered the best player playing baseball today. Like many other clubs, they met their legal obligation of tendering contracts by Dec. 20 using salaries players earned in 1986. At least they didn't cut Mattingly's salary by the maximum 20 percent, as some clubs did with players who had good seasons.\nWhatever the Yankees' justification for their tender, though, Mattingly doesn't expect contract negotiations to be any easier this year than the previous two. In 1985, the club's methods angered Mattingly and prompted him to speak bitterly about George Steinbrenner, the owner. Last year, club and player reached agreement on the eve of their salary arbitration hearing.\nSteinbrenner has already said he will not give the first baseman $2 million, but he could almost certainly win that kind of salary in arbitration.\n''I'm looking for a one-year deal,'' Mattingly said without indicating what salary he wants for the one year. ''I don't want any problems. I expect to get them. But I'm not going to worry about fighting them. The owners' stand on long-term contracts is fine with me. I don't mind one year at a time. I like it. When I see what happens with Winnyand other guys, I don't want to be locked in.'' Mattingly was referring to Dave Winfield, the primary object of Steinbrenner's verbal abuse.\nMattingly has spent a quiet offseason at his New Jersey home, focusing much of his attention on an indoor batting cage under construction next to his garage. He has, however, noted certain developments, or nondevelopments, across the river at Yankee Stadium.\n''One thing I've resented,'' Mattingly said, ''is that every time they talk about a free agent, Jack Morris or whoever, they talk about me and Ron and Willie not being signed as the reason they can't sign those other guys. If it was up to me, I'd be signed for next season making $1 million. Two years ago, I wanted four years for $4 million, and they wouldn't do it.''\nAs for the Yankees' refusal to sign Morris, who offered to have an arbitrator decide his salary, Mattingly remarked, ''The Morris thing really surprised me. When they offered arbitration for him, it was like saying, do you want the Tigers to have Morris or do you want him? It was going to be the same thing - arbitration. I was surprised that they offered that. I figured this guy wants to play in New York. Then I was surprised we didn't jump at the thing.''\nIn the present world of baseball, though, nothing about free agents really surprises Mattingly, who is convinced the owners have engaged in collusive practices. Looking to the future, when the players will confront the owners across the bargaining table, the game's No. 1 player said, ''It's time for the younger players to step up. Guys like the Baylors and the DeCinces, who have been strong in the union, are going to retire. They've made it nice for the young guys coming up. Now the young guys have to take over.''\nFirst came the change in the way the owners played the free-agent game. Now comes another game that may be a variation on the free-agent theme.\nPerhaps as many as 50 players on major league rosters were not tendered contracts, which means they are free agents. Their clubs were not doing them a favor by making them free agents. In many, if not most, of the cases, the clubs had an ulterior financial motive.\nThey actually want to re-sign the players, but not at the salaries they would have had to pay under the 20 percent maximum cut rule. By not tendering contracts, the clubs can sign players for salaries that represent cuts far greater than 20 percent. Furthermore, those players who would have been eligible for salary arbitration have lost that status by being free agents.\nThe Yankees, for example, would have had to give Bob Shirley a $600,000 salary, which is 80 percent of his 1986 salary of $750,000, or he could have opted for arbitration. They did not tender him a contract, but they are trying to sign him nevertheless.\n''A 20 percent cut would not have been pleasant, but it would have been acceptable,'' said Tony Attanasio, Shirley's agent. ''But they want to go $100,000 below that.''\nSlashing salaries, though, may not be the only element of this latest game that parallels the last two years of free agency. It's too early to determine, but the nontendered players may discover that despite their new status as free agents, other teams will not pursue them as long as their old teams retain interest in signing them.\nTake Darrell Evans as an example. In the last two years, he has hit 69 home runs and driven in 179 runs for Detroit. The Tigers might not have wanted to pay him as much as $634,666 (a 20 percent cut from $793,333), but are they prepared to give up his still-potent (despite his age of 39) left-handed bat? They didn't want to lose Jack Morris either as a free agent, and no other clubs would sign him as long as the Tigers remained interested. Will the other clubs stay away from Evans, too?\nSteve Balboni is in a similar position with Kansas City. He led the Royals with 29 home runs and 88 runs batted in and, with his back apparently healthy again, could provide some team with power and run production. But will anyone else sign him? ''The Royals would like to sign him,'' said Gary Wichard, Balboni's agent.\nCraig Fenech is one agent who plans to find out if the unwritten free-agent rules will apply to nontendered free agents as well.\n''We're not interested in signing with the White Sox again,'' said Fenech, the agent for Dave Schmidt, who was 15th among 87 American League relief pitchers in the ranking statistics. ''I haven't had any conversations with them since they told me they weren't tendering a contract. If other teams aren't interested, I can connect the dots. If no team makes an offer, that would be proof positive of the extension of collusion, which I believe exists with free agents.''\nTim Raines and Andre Dawson have said they will not re-sign with Montreal. Lance Parrish has said he will not re-sign with Detroit. Bob Horner, whose negotiations with Atlanta have regressed instead of progressed, has said that he, too, will go past the Thursday midnight deadline by which clubs have to sign free agents to whom they offered salary arbitration or lose rights to them until May 1.\nThey are the most talented among the 17 players in that position. They have not received offers from any other teams. They have no idea if they will receive offers after Thursday - no one tested the deadline last year - but they are confident the owners' game cannot extend that far.\nRon Guidry and Willie Randolph are growing weary of the Yankees' game. The team's co-captains, they have each been offered a two-year contract at $800,000 a year. They both have rejected the offers, which fall significantly below their 1986 salaries - $1,225,000 for Guidry and $1.1 million for Randolph.\n''It'll be a Thursday night 11:30 deal one way or the other,'' Reggie Ringuet, Guidry's agent, said. ''I don't know why they do it. I guess they're trying to put pressure on us.''\nThe pressure, however, will be on the Yankees if Thursday midnight passes and they no longer have their second baseman of 11 years and the anchor of their pitching staff for 10 years.\nScott Nielsen waits, too. Nielsen is the pitcher who led the Yankees in shutouts last season. That achievement placed him in company with such pitchers as Guidry, Whitey Ford, Allie Reynolds, Mel Stottlemyre, Catfish Hunter and Tommy John.\nNielsen, however, will not have a chance to add to his career Yankee shutout total of two because the Yankees have traded him to the Chicago White Sox. The only problem is that the Yankees, as has become their custom, have not announced the trade.\n''I read about it in the papers,'' Nielsen said, ''but when I didn't hear from anyone, I called the Yankees and was told it was only speculation. But I have to believe where there's smoke, there's fire. I'm excited about it. The trade will give me a better opportunity to make a major league club, although I'd like to stay with the Yankees if they would give me a chance to win a job.''\nNielsen spent 26 days with the Yankees in July, pitching a six-hit shutout in Minnesota July 12. He returned Sept. 1 and pitched a five-hit shutout in Boston on the last day of the season.\n''I was going to use that as a negotiating tool,'' Nielsen said. ''Leading the staff was pretty exciting.''\nWhen he is not pitching, Nielsen is an auditor with Price Waterhouse in Salt Lake City. He'll be in his office this week eagerly awaiting official confirmation of the trade. ''I would think they would have to let the cat out of the bag in the next week,'' he said. ''The holiday season is over and it's back to business. It would put my mind at ease.'' BASEBALL NOTEBOOK

745	FOR 'OLDER BOYS AND GIRLS' OF CHINA, MATCHMAKING	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DB1E38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Chen Gaixin is a fussy romantic.\nChen Gaixin is a fussy romantic.\nHer future husband, she insists, must be an intellectual, work for a research institute or the city government, have a house and be around 45 years old. He also should be ''frank, good-mannered and thoughtful.''\n''Oh yes,'' she adds, he must be taller than 1.70 meters - a hair under 5 feet 7 inches.\nAt 36, Miss Chen is one of a growing number of middle-aged singles. Once past 30, people like Miss Chen usually live with their parents and find that potential spouses are to find.\n''There are a lot of 'older boys and girls,' '' said Jiang Yuedi, a merry woman in her 50's who has devoted several years to matching lonely hearts. ''It is difficult for them to find someone. So we decided to set up this introduction room. This is a new thing and a good thing for society.'' A Centuries-Old Practice\nIn Shanghai, introduction rooms like Mrs. Jiang's are cropping up all over town. In many cases, retired workers like Mrs. Jiang have taken over the role of matchmaker, once performed by friends or relatives in a practice that is centuries old in China.\nA ''love corner,'' as it was known, used to flourish in People's Park here. ''Older boys and girls'' would gather by the hundreds, size one another up and, in many cases, drift off hand in hand. Over this past summer, the number of people who descended on People's Park seeking partners mushroomed and, according to the local press, hawkers began roosting on benches shouting such things as ''one, aged 34, is looking for a 28-year-old.''\nThe press denounced this activity as auctioneering, and the ''love corner'' was banned.\n''It is a real problem,'' said a young woman, whose shyness about giving her name was leavened by her willingness to try her English. ''There are not many situations where boys can meet girls. There is not much privacy. Many people wait too long. They want someone with a house or with a good job. By the time they don't find someone, they are already old.'' Factory Sponsors Dances\nThe woman said her brother's plant, a glass factory with a predominantly male work force, sponsored monthly dances with a nearby textile factory that employs women. A few late-night coffee shops have sprung up downtown, where, the woman said, ''boyfriends bring girlfriends for privacy.''\n''But it is hard to meet new people there,'' she added.\nDistressed over these difficulties, Mrs. Jiang and a handful of her friends persuaded their neighborhood street committee to allocate them a room in an apartment building.\n''When we first started, people did not want to come because it meant they were unable to find someone on their own,'' said Kang Maoying, a neighborhood official who works with Mrs. Jiang.\nThe women printed forms asking love-seekers a battery of personal questions - none too personal - about jobs, salaries, education, their housing situation, habits and hobbies, their needs, and, of course, their height. Space is provided for a photograph. The women collect a fee of about 40 cents. 'Probably Lie About Height'\n''When they fill in the form, they probably lie about their height,'' Qu Jieda, one of the matchmakers, said. ''Of course, when people see each other, they realize this.''\nHeight, it appears, is the most crucial consideration in a spouse, and Mrs. Jiang puts it at the top of her list of why young women cannot find spouses.\n''The young men are not tall enough,'' Mrs. Jiang. ''The girls want men taller than they are. Of course, another problem is housing. If the boy does not have his own place, the girl does not want him as a husband. For some girls, the requirements are so high, they wait and wait and get past 30.''\nOne of the applicants, Qu Leimeng, noted on his form that he was born in 1958, ''the Year of the Dog,'' and was a college graduate and technician. His salary, he said, was the equivalent of $34.50 a month, but he had no apartment of his own. He lived with his parents. Mr. Qu professed to a height of 5 feet 7 inches and wanted a woman who was ''a little cute to do housework and be tender.'' College Education a Factor\nMrs. Qu leafed through a stack of applications.\n''Men who are tall and good-looking will probably have no problem,'' she said. ''Those a little bit ugly or not too tall may have to wait a while. Girls all hope the boys will be taller than they are. You are allowed only one child, so if the husband is tall, the child will be tall. It is kind of a tradition for women to have tall men.''\n''Of course,'' she said, ''men who are not very tall but are college graduates will have no problem. But if a boy is not tall and, on top of that, is not a college graduate, well, it probably will be difficult.''\nMrs. Jiang said applicants could pore through application forms and select someone from a photograph.\n''Then we send out a letter setting up an appointment,'' she said.\nDiscretion requires that the letter go out in a plain envelope without a return address, Mrs. Jiang said. ''Some people don't want others to know that they use our services,'' she added.\nThe initial meeting occurs in the introduction room at the end of a six-foot table on two folding chairs.\n''Sometimes they come and, after a moment, they say they will go out and talk elsewhere,'' Mrs. Jiang said.\n''If it does not work, we start over,'' she said. ''We try to be more careful next time. There was one girl, 36, who saw 10 people and at last succeeded this year. She wanted an articulate, open, faithful person who would not try and dominate her. She got someone who works in a milk research institute.''

''I'm Just Wild About Harry,'' from the musical ''Shuffle Along,'' circa 1921, is, of course, the most familiar song of the lot.\nAmong moments to savor in the Crossroads production, count ''Weary'' and ''Memories of You,'' interpreted in rending blues and spiritual styles by the high-flying soprano of Darlene Bel Grayson.\nPraise, too, the torrid dancing of Steven Cates in ''You Got to Git the Gittin' While the Gittin's Good,'' Roumel Reaux's witty softshoe routine in ''Dixie Moon'' and Renee Warren's delightfully insinuating vocal manner in such numbers as ''If You've Never Been Vamped by a Brownskin, You've Never Been Vamped at All.''\nWhich is not intended to slight Luther Fontaine (watch his cartwheels), Lawrence Hamilton, Traci Robinson or Gayle Samuels. Indeed, this entire cast of eight dancing singers - or singing dancers - are, individually and in harmony, splendid.\nThe show runs through Jan. 18, but New Jersey will not be without the songs of Eubie Blake for long.\nAt the beginning of April, another production of the musical will be presented by Newark's Theater of Universal Images, where it will be directed by Lynnie Godfrey, a member of the original cast.\nTHEATER
747	PACE KEEPS POWER IN SUFFOLK G.O.P.	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DA1E38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: ANTHONY PACE, the Islip Republican town leader, emerged from the maneuvering over the Republican choice for Suffolk County Executive as still the most powerful Republican town leader in Suffolk County.\nANTHONY PACE, the Islip Republican town leader, emerged from the maneuvering over the Republican choice for Suffolk County Executive as still the most powerful Republican town leader in Suffolk County.\nIt was Mr. Pace's choice, Islip Supervisor Michael A. LoGrande, who was selected by town leaders for the acting county executive post, a prelude to nomination for a full four-year term in the fall, even though another Pace protege, former County Executive Peter F. Cohalan, was pressured to step aside by leaders because of his unpopularity in polls.\nMr. Cohalan was elected to the State Supreme Court bench in November and took office last Friday.\nMr. Pace had engineered the unprecedented 1979 Republican primary in which Mr. Cohalan defeated an incumbent Republican County Executive, John V. N. Klein of Smithtown, now a prominent Long Island lawyer.\nThe Pace push for Mr. LoGrande this time was aided by several factors, Republican leaders said.\nA major factor was the electoral arithmetic. Islip and Brookhaven have the largest populations in the county and the largest Republican votes at a county convention at which the county executive candidate will be formally nominated next year.\nIn addition, Mr. LoGrande impressed Republican leaders with his credentials and his presentation at an unusual daylong session in which 10 potential Republican candidates for county executive were interviewed separately by nine of the Republican town leaders in Suffolk.\n''LoGrande had an impressive background; I had never seen his resume,'' said Edward Ecker, the East Hampton Republican leader.\nMr. LoGrande was also aided by the belief of several Republican leaders, including William M. Blake, the Republican county leader, that Mr. LoGrande's principal competitor, Brookhaven Supervisor Henrietta Acampora, would not be a strong candidate in the general election next November because of her age, 64 years; her propensity to shoot from the hip publicly, and nepotism accusations when she attempted to put family members on the public payroll.\nAnother leading contender, State Senator James J. Lack of East Northport, was ruled out, several leaders said, because he preferred a special election for county executive early this year, which Republican leaders do not want; his concern about a new candidacy just after his re-election to the State Senate, and the contention of some Republican leaders that the Conservative Party had reservations about him, a point disputed by a Conservative leader, Harold Haar of Smithtown.\nSome Republican leaders believe that Mr. Lack was the first choice of Mr. Blake, the county leader, but in any event, Mr. Blake served as coordinator of the effort to find a consensus successor to Mr. Cohalan rather than as a political boss with his own preference.\n''For the first time, he wasn't working his own deals,'' said a Republican town leader of Mr. Blake, who had incurred disfavor among other leaders because of his positions on races for surrogate, presiding officer of the County Legislature and the House seat in the First Congressional District.\nMr. Blake helped develop the consensus for Mr. LoGrande, several leaders said.\nMr. Haar, the Conservative, summed up the views of many Conservatives and Republicans about Mr. Blake's role.\n''Mike Blake doesn't have the power,'' he said, ''so he's trying to be the oil to grease the skids; he's done the best with what he's got.''\nWith both Mr. Blake and Mr. Pace playing major roles in Mr. LoGrande's promotion, their roles in the new administration are likely to be scrutinized.\nMr. Pace had a considerable influence in the Cohalan Administration with two of his followers, Frank R. Jones and Howard C. DeMartini, as deputy county executives. Mr. DeMartini, in particular, was viewed by politicians as the Pace emissary in county government.\nMr. Pace said that both would remain in government even though they are not expected to remain in their present positions, where they often ran the day-to-day Suffolk County government.\n''Pete was more of a delegator; Mike is more of a hands-on administrator,'' Mr. Pace said. He described Mr. LoGrande as ''a strong and forceful individual,'' a description that others amended to ''hot-tempered.''\nMr. Pace said that he had ''a good relationship'' with Mr. LoGrande in Islip and that Mr. LoGrande worked with the party. He added that Mr. Cohalan rather than the party originally brought Mr. LoGrande into Islip town government when Mr. Cohalan was Supervisor.\nMr. Pace described Mr. LoGrande as ''one of the brightest public servants in the state'' and predicted that ''in the next three or four months he will come up with ideas and programs that will be real eye-openers.''\nIn the same period, Mr. LoGrande, politicians agreed, will have to walk a fine line with the Republican Party that gave him his chance to be county executive, keeping an arm's-length relationship so that he is not too identified with party leaders and yet satisfying fractious Republican leaders enough that they will unite behind his candidacy in November against the expected Democratic candidate for county executive, Assemblyman Patrick G. Halpin of Lindenhurst.\nPOLITICS

''In the last five years we are getting more high-school graduates who cannot read,'' said Joy Powell at the organization's headquarters on the campus of Westchester Community College in Valhalla.\nA countywide effort to train volunteers and recruit students is under way for 1987, with one trainee workshop beginning this week at the New Rochelle Public Library. Tutors must be high-school graduates, but they need no other educational qualifications. Sessions are scheduled from 9:30 A.M. to noon Wednesday and Friday through Jan. 23. Those who successfully complete the program will be assigned to students in their area.\nStudents are accepted from the minimum age of 16, whether or not they are still in school. There is no upper age limit.\n''Tutors are taught a mixture of teaching methods,'' said Ms. Powell, ''including word association and sounding out. There is a lot of participation in role playing and acting out potentially difficult situations. Tutors may also get involved in teaching conversational English as a second language, but they do not have to speak a second language themselves. It's sometimes hard to establish communication with someone who speaks almost no English, but students are so highly motivated that it eventually works out.''\nShe added: ''Recently we have had many women in their 50's and 60's call us about their husbands, who have somehow been functioning without learning how to read for more than 30 years. Now that they are retired, and cannot read stories to their grandchildren, they are willing to let their wives set up appointments for them. Widespread publicity has removed some of the stigma. They realize they are not alone.''\nFor more information about training programs in other locations, or to register as a student or tutor trainee call 592-2656. SINGERS WANTED\nThe Westchester Choral Society needs singers in all voice ranges for its May 9 performance of Brahms's ''Ein Deutsches Requiem'' at the Performing Arts Center, State University of New York at chase. Auditions are to be held at 7 P.M. each Tuesday in January at St. Bartholomew's Church, 82 Prospect Street, White Plains. Lyndon Woodside is the director. Call 693-2453 for more information. BRAIN DEVELOPMENT\nJacqueline Hammer's workshop on developing the abilities of the right side of the brain, attended by capacity audiences each year since 1984, will be repeated next weekend at Wainwright House in Rye. Admission to her lecture, from 7:30 to 10 P.M. Friday, is $10; tuition for the lecture plus two workshops from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday and next Sunday is $90.\nMs. Hammer, who majored in painting and art history at Columbia University, and also studied at the Art Student's League and Pratt Institute in New York and in Rome, is a professional artist and teacher with a special interest in ''right brain people.'' ''She works with techniques based on new brain research,'' said Kathleen Madden of Wainwright House. ''Participants learn to control the left brain tendency to classify and judge, and to free the right brain's spatial and visual capacity to see as an artist does.''\n''She contends that everyone has the functional ability to draw, and she employs visualization exercises to loosen up the right brain's creativity,'' Ms. Madden said. ''The right brain controls the left side of the body, which is why many right brain, artistic people are left-handed. Since most education is geared for left brain learning, the need is for more right brain education in order to arrive at a better balance.''\nParticipants are required to bring a 14-by-17-inch drawing pad, B and 3B pencils, a kneaded eraser, pencil sharpener, scissors and glue. To register or obtain more information call 967-6080. Wainwright House is at 260 Stuyvesant Avenue. FREE CONCERT\nThe Manhattan School of Music is sponsoring a free concert at 2:30 this afternoon in the New Rochelle Public Library. Two of its doctoral degree candidates and a Master of Music candidate at the Juilliard School will perform an unusual program of works by Johann Hummel, a student of Mozart and Clementi; Carl Reinecke, teacher, conductor and composer of operas, harp concertos and chamber music until his death in 1910; and Wenzel Krumpholtz, Bohemian violinist, mandolin player and champion of his friend Beethoven.\nRana Park, harpist and doctoral candidate at Juilliard, was a semi-finalist in the 1986 Geneva International Harp Competition, and winner of the Elizabeth H. Hobin Harp Scholarship Competition in the United States. The pianist, Young-Ho Kim, earned his bachelor and master of music degrees at Juilliard as a student of Sascha Gorodnitski and Herbert Stessin, and he is currently in the doctoral program at Manhattan School of Music. Also studying for his doctorate at the Manhattan School is the flutist Hae-Kyung Lee, who has appeared as soloist with the Korean National Symphony Orchestra and in the United States with the New School of Music Orchestra and the Manhattan Symphony Orchestra.\nFree seating is available on a first-come basis. The library is located in downtown New Rochelle at Library Plaza. REPORT ON DRUG\n''Hope For The Future'' is the title of a talk about advances in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by John P. Blass, professor of neurology and medicine at Cornell University, and director of dementia research services at Burke Rehabilitation Center in White Plains. The program begins at 7:30 P.M. Tuesday in the center's Wood Pavilion, Room G41, sponsored by the Westchester Chapter of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc.\nThe focus of Dr. Blass' talk will be tetrahydroaminoacridine, or THA, a new oral drug treatment recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. According to the report, 10 out of 17 patients to whom the drug was administered in a University of California study improved significantly and had no serious side effects. Continued research and testing must be done before the drug can be assessed for widespread use.\nBurke Rehabilitation Center is at 785 Mamaroneck Avenue. Families of patients and those interested in the subject may attend free of charge. Call 428-1919 for more information.
749	TOKYO'S VIEW OF AMERICAN SYSTEM	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D81E38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In a companion report to an American study of Japanese schools that was released today, a Japanese team has concluded that recent attempts at change in the United States ''may be valuable as a reference tool'' for solving problems here.\nIn a companion report to an American study of Japanese schools that was released today, a Japanese team has concluded that recent attempts at change in the United States ''may be valuable as a reference tool'' for solving problems here.\nBut the Japanese side mentioned no specific aspect of American education that it considered worth emulating. An underlying tone of the report was that cultural and bureaucratic differences might be too great for the United States' experience to have immediate relevance to Japan.\n''It is not our intention that contents of the current American educational system and reforms in it be proposed as elements of educational reform in Japan,'' the study said.\nIn fact, its chief author, Isao Amagi, said at a recent news conference that it seemed to be the Americans who believed they had something to learn. 'Sputnik Shock' to 'Tokyo Shock'\n''Recently, the outcome of common math tests show Japanese kids scoring higher than Americans,'' said Mr. Amagi, who led the study for the Ministry of Education. ''American scholars have begun to question why. They know that Japanese class hours are longer than the Americans' and that Japanese schools are using the class hours more efficiently, and that Japanese teachers impose a lot of homework on kids.''\n''American scholars,'' Mr. Amagi went on, ''seem to share the view that the American educational system has fallen into mediocrity. American kids register very bad scores on international tests. In the past they talked of a 'Sputnik shock.' Now maybe there's a 'Toyota shock' or a 'Japan shock.' ''\nHis group's 75-page report is not nearly so sweeping as the one prepared by the United States team. It is also virtually devoid of firm judgments, pro or con, about specific facets of American education. An earlier draft did draw a few conclusions, but those sections were dropped from the final version.\nThe task of the researchers, who visited the United States, was made difficult, Mr. Amagi said, by the great variations they found as they went from state to state, in contrast to the nationwide uniformity that marks Japanese schools. Criticism at Joint Meeting\n''Even to put a trend in American education into historical perspective is very hard work,'' he went on. ''We spent long hours studying what happened in the 1960's in order to understand what is happening now in the 1980's.\n''But at a joint meeting with our American counterparts some of them criticized our efforts, saying that what happened in the last 25 years absolutely cannot be understood unless you lived during that period in America.''\nThe Japanese report characterizes current American efforts in education as an attempt ''to produce excellence.'' But in contrast to Japan, it said, the United States must balance many competing interests and needs.\nAs examples, it cited the American desire to raise educational levels while also avoiding elitism and to offer students freedom of choice while trying to set uniform standards of achievement. Another possible conflict, the study said, lies in the fact that it had been customary for local boards to run the schools but now ''it is the individual states which are taking the initiative in educational reform.'' Dillemmas as Source of Vitality\n''It can be seen that American education, in building upon the traditional ideals of equality and diversity in trying to find a new excellence, is confronted with dilemmas and inflated with a kind of crisis outlook,'' the Japanese researchers reported. ''But these very dilemmas are both the energy fueling reform and the vitality of American education itself.''\nThe report concentrates on high school studies, college entrance requirements and the quality of undergraduate education, all areas of special interest to Japanese as they re-examine their own methods. Quoting from recent studies by American educators, the Japanese researchers cited the worries in the United States about teacher skills, dropout rates, poor student performance and lowered college standards.\nWith a note of mild irony, the Japanese researchers also observed that Americans were seeking greater uniformity and tougher testing procedures in their schools at a time when Japan was looking to go in the other direction. Concern on University Admissions\nIt is widely believed here that Japanese education, while producing nearly universal literacy and a highly motivated labor force, has also emphasized rote learning at the expense of creative thinking. Of particular concern is the university admissions process, which relies almost exclusively on nationwide entrance examinations.\nThe pressure on Japanese youths to do well on these tests is intense, for their futures are determined to a large degree by whether they get into good schools.
750	WINTER DROUGHT IN WEST IDLES WOULD-BE SKIERS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D71E38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In Idaho's Sun Valley, there is so little snow this winter that would-be skiers were recently invited to attend a lecture on ''Skiing and Good Sex'' and another on ''Rhinoceros Poaching in Zimbabwe.''\nIn Idaho's Sun Valley, there is so little snow this winter that would-be skiers were recently invited to attend a lecture on ''Skiing and Good Sex'' and another on ''Rhinoceros Poaching in Zimbabwe.''\nIn the Mammoth Lakes region northeast of Los Angeles, many of the ski slopes are so barren that mountain resort owners are trying to lure visitors with promises of good weather for tennis and horseback riding.\nAnd in Utah's Wasatch Mountains, where it has not snowed for 34 days, Robbie Beck, an official with the Park City Ski Area, said cancellations were running 40 percent or more.\n''It's been so long since it's snowed,'' she said, ''that I don't even check the weather reports anymore.''\nAs 1987 begins, much of the West is experiencing the worst winter drought in a decade, and resort owners say it has already cost them more than $100 million in lost revenue. Snow Finally Appears\nLast week the first significant storm of the season finally brought snow to the High Sierras near Lake Tahoe. But resort operators in the area said that they had already lost $70 million this season and that there was little prospect they would ever recoup the money.\n''We're like farmers,'' said Kay Williams, who works for the North Tahoe Visitors Bureau. ''We depend on the weather for good crops.''\nA year ago much of the West was experiencing one of the stormiest winters of the century and was bracing for floods that eventually washed out thousands of homes from California to Utah.\nBut since early fall precipitation has been running well below normal in most of the region. Temperatures in many areas have averaged several degrees warmer than usual.\nUnless conditions change soon, meteorologists say this could be the driest winter in the West since most of the droughts in 1976 and 1977 that caused serious water shortages in many communities. Some States Were Lucky\nSnow levels have approached normal in parts of Colorado, Washington and Oregon, attracting many skiers who canceled vacations elsewhere. But even in these states lighter-than-usual snowfall has forced many resorts to supplement nature with large amounts of expensive machine-made snow.\n''We couldn't accommodate any more people if we wanted to,'' said Spencer Videon, president of the Aspen Resort Association in Colorado.\nIsolated snowstorms dusted the slopes of a few resorts in the West late last week, encouraging some resort operators to suggest that the worst of their problems may be over. But they said that even if weather conditions changed substantially, it would be impossible to make up the earlier losses. 'Beggers Can't Be Choosers'\nStill, Debbie Kelly, sales director at the Squaw Valley resort near Lake Tahoe, where poor snow conditions have cut patronage 50 percent so far this season, said, ''Beggers can't be choosers.''\nRobert Roberts, executive director of the Sierra Ski Area Association, said that only 5 of 21 resorts in the Lake Tahoe-Reno area had even opened this year, and 4 of the 5 were using snow-making equipment to produce marginal skiing conditions.\nNancy Newberg of Ski Utah, which promotes skiing at 16 resort areas, said it would take a drastic change in weather conditions and a long spring skiing season to avert a projected decline of at least 10 percent in the $350 million that the promotional agency estimates is spent annually by skiers in Utah.\nEven under ideal conditions, the resort operators say they have a relatively brief time in which to turn a profit. The period between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day often accounts for about a third of their annual revenue.\nLinda Martin of the Mammoth Lakes Resort Association near Los Angeles, which says it is the busiest ski resort complex in the nation under normal conditions, said shopkeepers, merchants, gas stations and other local businesses were also suffering heavily as a result of the drought. The average skier spends about $75 a day, Ms. Martin said. ''A year ago we had had 300,000 skiers here by now; this year, we've done zero.'' Following Through With Plans\nMany vacationers, including many who had paid for their travel months ago or were committed to take a vacation over the holidays when their children were out of school, went through with their plans for a trip to the Western ski slopes despite the poor skiing conditions.\nThis averted an even greater financial problem for resort operators and sometimes led to frantic searches for alternative ways to entertain guests.\nAlthough idle skiers in the Lake Tahoe area could head for the slot machines at local casinos, resort operators elsewhere were promoting hiking, fishing, tennis, skeet shooting, ice-skating and other pursuits.\n''We might lose on one end of our operation, but we'll recoup on another,'' said Karl Wilgus, an official at Idaho's Sun Valley resort, which has been operating at 85 percent of capacity despite dismal skiing conditions. The lectures on sex, rhinoceros poaching and other topics have helped skiiers pass the time, he said, and may even be included on a regular basis when snow falls once again.\nMr. Wilgus said the resort had hired a professional ''cloud seeder'' in an effort to stimulate a snow fall. He added, ''Unfortunately, there haven't been any clouds for him to seed.''
751	AIDS DANGER: AFRICA SEEMS OF TWO MINDS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED71E38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: One week, health authorities here completed a pioneering comic book designed to warn Central Africans in simple language about the danger of AIDS.\nOne week, health authorities here completed a pioneering comic book designed to warn Central Africans in simple language about the danger of AIDS.\nThe next week, officials destroyed videotapes made by a French television crew about AIDS victims in Bangui Hospital.\nIn this capital, where 4 percent of all adults are believed to be infected with the AIDS virus, the seemingly contradictory actions by local authorities in December reflected attitudes common in much of Africa toward AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\nWhen talking to their own citizens, African governments increasingly treat AIDS like any other public health problem. When talking to the outside world, African governments appear to seek to hide the problem.\nIn Zaire, a pro-Government newspaper, Elima, recently published a series of six articles describing AIDS and giving advice on how to avoid getting it. 'Serene and Humane'\n''Zaire has opted for an objective information campaign, serene and humane, and continues to refuse to allow its fellow citizens who are victims of AIDS to become the object of cynical and unhealthy exploitation by the Western press,'' wrote Kitoto Kalombo, information director of Zaire's Public Health Department.\nIn addition to warning about the dangers of dirty needles and transfusions of contaminated blood, Mr. Kalombo advised Zaireans to avoid ''nomadic sex.''\nIn another sign of Africa's increasing frankness about AIDS, Jeune Afrique, the leading news weekly of French-speaking Africa, made AIDS the leading article of its year-end issue.\n''We must tell the truth,'' the article on AIDS in Africa began. ''Africa is the most affected continent.'' Placing the Blame\nThe author said those responsible for ignorance in Africa about AIDS were ''doctors anxious to avoid panic,'' journalists with a ''misplaced'' sense of responsibility and governments ''that have practiced an ostrich policy.''\nBut many Africans believe that international discussion of AIDS in Africa puts the continent in an unfavorable light.\nIn November, several Nigerian newspapers published an article distributed by the Soviet press-feature syndicate Novosti on the origin of AIDS. The article implied that the deadly AIDS virus escaped after ''secret experiments at a laboratory developing biological weapons at Fort Detrick, Md.''\nThe true origin of the virus is not known. According to an article published in Science magazine in November, the earliest known AIDS virus was identified in Kinshasa, Zaire, in 1959.\nIn Bangui in December, Health Ministry officials declined to talk about AIDS with an American reporter, but the problem was openly discussed among residents. Tests in Army Brothels\nThe French Army regularly administers AIDS antibody tests, which indicate infection but not whether a person will develop the fatal disease, to ''African hostesses'' who work in the army's two field brothels, one here and another in Bouar, about 200 miles northwest of here.\nSo far, according to Col. Jean Carrie of the French Army, no French soldier garrisoned in the Central African Republic has died of AIDS.\nBut it is estimated that 800 Central Africans and two Europeans died of AIDS here in 1986.\nIn 1985, a random sample of 327 adults in Bangui between the ages of 15 and 34 found that 4 percent had antibodies to the AIDS virus in their blood. A separate survey of local prostitutes found an infection rate of 19 percent.\n''AIDS is a very serious problem in Central Africa,'' said Alain Jean Georges, one of the authors of the survey. Dr. Georges, who is research director at the Pasteur Institute here, said his laboratory performs 100 blood tests for AIDS antibodies a week.\nNext door to the institute, in the crowded wards of Bangui Hospital, doctors often do not bother to test for AIDS. Instead of ordering a $20 blood test, nurses have been trained to detect AIDS by consulting a rudimentary chart of symptoms prepared by the World Health Organization.\nIn one bed, Fatima Germain, an AIDS patient from Bangui, lay still. Her withered 25-year-old frame displayed several AIDS symptoms -weight loss, fever, cough and diarrhea. Stress on Preventive Care\nWith a population of 3 million people and a Health Ministry budget of $5 million, the Central African Republic spends an average of $1.67 a year on health care for a citizen.\nTo maximize this limited budget, the ministry stresses preventive care. Officials have encouraged Dr. Jean-Louis Lesbordes, a French doctor at the hospital, to undertake a public education program about AIDS.\nIn 1986 Dr. Lesbordes and a local artist, Gosue Daikou, prepared the comic book about AIDS.\nIn recent years, Dr. Lesbordes has repeatedly spoken on the national radio, issuing warnings about AIDS.\n''Women have come up to me and have thanked me, saying, 'After you talked on the radio, my husband stopped going out,' '' Dr. Lesbordes said.\nBut the authorities were not so enthusiastic about an interview Dr. Lesbordes gave in December to Antenne 2, the French television network. Employees from the Information Ministry seized the videotape and erased it.

When his job was done, he left that way, and no one knew his name.\nHe dropped out of the sky like an angel of mercy. When his job was done, he left that way, and no one knew his name.\nIn the first agonizing minutes of the New Year's Eve fire at the Dupont Plaza Hotel, the man, later identified as Pat Walter, a 41-year-old helicopter pilot, initiated a daring rooftop rescue of trapped guests until larger Navy helicopters could reach the scene.\nFor about 45 minutes Mr. Walter, who operates a charter helicopter service based in St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, plucked hysterical women and children from the burning 22-story building and deposited them safely on the beach below.\nBy his own count he rescued at least 21 guests in his five-seat Jet Ranger before clearing out to let larger military helicopters pick up victims.\nMr. Walter had no hoist aboard. He had to maneuver his craft perilously close to the edge of the roof, blinded at times by a column of smoke and heat pouring out of the hotel, encouraging terrified guests to hop aboard his shuddering rescue vessel. One Skid Down on the Roof'\n''I could get only one skid down on the roof,'' Mr. Walter said today in a telephone interview from St. Thomas, which is about 120 miles east of San Juan.\n''That chopper pilot did one hell of a job of flying,'' said Charles R. Hinojosa, a private pilot who flew over the scene in a winged aircraft in the early moments of Wednesday's disaster.\nMr. Hinojosa, a sales engineer, said he was taking a company plane up for a spin from Isla Grande, a private airport near the Condado Beach resort here, when he saw a towering column of smoke about one mile away. ''I thought at first a fuel truck had exploded or perhaps an airplane had crashed,'' he said.\nOnce up on the air, he had a close view of the disaster scene. The burning hotel, like a tall square spike planted at the edge of the blue sea, was engulfed in smoke. Seeing the Smoke\nAbout this time, about five miles away at San Juan Interntional Airport, Mr. Walter also saw the black smoke column. He had just unloaded a charter flight of four people traveling from the Virgin Islands to a New Year's Eve party in San Juan.\nReturning aloft he communicated by radio with the authorities, who said his helicopter was needed. He was given clearance to land at Isla Grande and refueled on the ground with one engine running. He was quickly back in the air and headed to the Dupont Plaza.\nA police helicopter was already at the scene but the pilot did not think he could land on the roof because it was not flat, said Mr. Hinojosa, who was monitoring radio transmissions as he circled the area. There is a penthouse restaurant cantilevered from the walls of the hotel, and on the penthouse roof is a tall structure housing engineering machinery. On top of that are exhaust pipes and other obstacles that could snag a helicopter's blades and send it crashing.\n''We heard on the radio that the Navy and the Coast Guard couldn't get to the scene for 40 minutes or so,'' Mr. Hinojosa said. Guests Huddled in Terror\nMr. Walter, observing growing numbers of trapped guests huddled in terror, decided something had to be done right away.\n''I realized I could get in there,'' he recalled. But the closest he dared approach the building was to put one landing skid down on the edge of the roof.\nAfter coaxing four women and children aboard and bringing them down safely to the ground, he returned to the roof with a police officer who helped calm guests and organize the evacuation. Mr. Hinojosa said the pilot of the police helicopter, apparently emboldened by Mr. Walter's daring, joined the shuttle service, lifting victims and ferrying more rescue personnel.

CLARINETIST IN CONCERT ''Charles Neidich, a Pied Piper of the clarinet whose eminence among young practitioners of that instrument was ratified last year with a victory in the Naumburg Clarinet Competition, distinguished the American Symphony Orchestra concert in Carnegie Hall with as lively an account of the Mozart concerto as one is likely to hear,'' wrote Will Crutchfield in a New York Times review last March.\nNext Sunday afternoon, Mr. Neidich will be at Montclair High School for a performance sponsored by Unity Concerts.\nThe program, which starts at 3:30, will comprise Premiere Rhapsodie by Claude Debussy, ''Abrimes des Oiseaux'' (from ''Quartet for the End of Time'') by Olivier Messinaeu, Sonata Op. 167 (''Undine'') by Carl Reineche, Vierstuche Op.5 by Alban Berg, ''Moonflowers, Baby!'' by Meyer Kupferman and ''Grand Fantasia on Thames'' (from ''La Traviata'') by Donato Lovreglio.\nMr. Crutchfield found the clarinetist's showmanship was not without visual flair.\n''Mr. Neidich is a swayer, a knee-bender and a dancer,'' he wrote. ''In allegros, he describes broad arcs of 90 degrees with the bell of his clarinet, and in adagios, he leans forward to whisper themes in confidence.\n''The physicality and the musicality inform and reflect each other in his playing. He knows how to make a sparking climax with the most conventional Mozartean cadences; he makes manifest both in phrasing and body language the tension of a diminished seventh chord.''\nMontclair High School is at Park and Chestnut Streets, and concert tickets are $11, $13, $14.50 and $17 (student rush is $5). Information: (201) 744-6770. BACH IN DENVILLE Prof. Peter Schickele, the medium of works by P.D.Q. Bach - Professor Schickele describes him as the ''last and least'' of J. S.

755	TAYLOR PROVIDES A MANY-FACETED SELF-PORTRAIT	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDE1F38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In a candid self-assessment, Lawrence Taylor has portrayed himself as ''a plain wild dude.'' And he adds, ''I live life wild . . . I hang with the bums. I hang with the regular people.'' At the same time, he says, ''I've always felt comfortable with myself.''\nIn a candid self-assessment, Lawrence Taylor has portrayed himself as ''a plain wild dude.'' And he adds, ''I live life wild . . . I hang with the bums. I hang with the regular people.'' At the same time, he says, ''I've always felt comfortable with myself.''\nIn a rare and far-reaching interview, the Giants' outside linebacker acknowledges that he is one of the best ever to play his position. But though The Associated Press voted him this week as the National Football League's most valuable player, only the second defensive player to gain that honor, he says he has retrogressed physically in his six years as a pro and is less enthusiastic about football.\nHe will not become 28 years old for a month. Still, he says, ''I'm a guy who's starting to get old.''\nHe says he has only two or three years of football left. He does not sound as if he regrets it because he says he has done almost everything he wants to do in football. Underwent Treatments\nLast winter, on his own, Taylor underwent treatment for chemical abuse, believed to involve alcohol and cocaine. For months afterward, he did not speak with the news media.\nIn midseason, he began chatting, usually about nonfootball subjects, with a few reporters who covered the Giants daily. Then, after games, came a few football comments.\nIn recent weeks, he has talked more, though never with the scope or frankness of this interview. He discussed everything except his problems with chemical abuse.\n''I don't want to talk about that,'' he said. ''It's nobody's business but mine.'' It was and is also the business of Bill Parcells. In his four years as the Giants' head coach, Parcells has rid the team of several players he thought had drug or drinking problems.\nSources familiar with Taylor's case said Parcells had encouraged Taylor to get treatment and helped arrange for it. When the treatment ended, Taylor issued a statement through the team acknowledging the treatment. In the statement, he asked that the media respect his privacy in the matter. Parcells vociferously defended Taylor's right not to discuss the matter. Parcells Eased Pressure\n''Bill has taken so much pressure off me,'' said Taylor. ''He was ridiculed. I think he was the big reason I had a good year this year, not having to deal with the press.\n''A lot of people were hoping I would fall flat on my face and wouldn't recover. I didn't fall on my face. Anytime somebody says I can't do something, it ticks me off. I'm competing with myself. But without motivation, I can't get up every day and do it.\n''The things I went through served as motivation for me. I'm competing not only with myself but with the people who said I couldn't do it. Bill Parcells said he had confidence and pride in me. I had pride in that. I appreciated that.''\nTaylor was certainly not exaggerating when he said he had a good year. He was voted to the Pro Bowl and various all-pro teams for the sixth time. He led the league in sacks with 20 1/2, only 1 1/2 short of Mark Gastineau's 1984 record.\n''A terrific year,'' said Bill Belichick, the Giants' defensive coordinator.\n''Not as good as 1983,'' said Taylor, ''but good enough.''\nOne reason for the good year was a change in the Giants' defensive philosophy. Because Taylor is so effective as a pass rusher, he has rushed the passer 75 to 80 percent of the time this year, compared with 40 to 45 percent last year. He has forced opposing teams to change their defensive schemes to block him with a big and quick offensive lineman rather than a running back or tight end he can overpower with his strength and incredible quickness. Not a Victim of All Work\nBy his admission, he has never been a victim of all work and no play. Off the field, he has usually done what he wants.\n''I guess that I'm just a plain wild dude,'' he said. ''I live life wild. I play wild, but I do it all my own way. I don't really care what other people expect of me or what I'm supposed to do or how society says I'm supposed to do certain things. I do it my way and try to get the job done that way.\n''I don't put on airs or stuff. I don't try to act like I'm high society or go to high-society places. I hang with the bums. I hang with the regular people. I make mistakes like everybody else. But I'm just here doing a job. I'm just a blue-collar worker.''\nHis salary is not exactly blue collar. In January 1984, the Giants bought out a future contract he had signed with the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. The Giants then signed him to a seven-year contract worth $6.25 million. In this, the third year of that contract, his base salary is $850,000.\nAt the worst, he is a middle-aged linebacker. He talks of himself as an old man.\n''I'm enjoying football,'' he said, ''but it's starting to get down toward the end of my career. I'm not having as much fun.\n''I just have two or three years left. I still enjoy Sundays, but it's hard to enjoy the rest of the week. It's becoming a drag just to go out there now, so it's starting slowly to become more like work than fun. If Bill Parcells hadn't taken a lot of pressure off me, it would have been worse. Gets Tired More and Easier\n''I'm a guy who's starting to get old, not as old as some but a lot older than others. I'm a lot slower than I used to be. I get tired easier. I can still run, but I get tired more. There are a lot of moves I used to do that I can't do anymore. That's part of playing football.\n''It's not distressing. I compensate with other things. I'm a little smarter than I used to be. I try to use that to my advantage.\n''What makes it so hard is that I can't surprise anybody anymore. In the Green Bay game, a lot of people were beating tattoos on me. I got hit so many times it was unreal. I don't think I can last two more years and get beat up like that 16 games a year.''\nEnthusiasm often makes up for shortcomings, but there, too, Taylor says he is not what he once was.\n''I think I'm less enthusiastic than I used to be,'' he said. ''I'm like an old veteran. You pick your spots to be enthusiastic, but you don't want to waste your energy like a 22-year-old.\n''I try to conserve my energy. I walk to the huddle. I don't run. I walk when the play is over. I don't go into the pile unless I have to. One of the main things at this point in my career is not to get hurt.''\nTaylor's professed dropoff in enthusiasm may surprise opposing players whose main job is to keep him off the quarterback's back. It may surprise running backs who find Taylor flying across from the other side of the field and stopping them before they get past the line of scrimmage. Standards Are High\nHis standards and his abilities are so high that his average performance may be better than someone else's best. Some football people have called him the best linebacker in history. Others have called him the best defensive player in history.\n''I've done what I've wanted to do in this league,'' he said. ''I can say I've had a good career. But there are other things out there outside of football I'd like to try. Football is not going to be my whole life. I don't know what I want to do after football. I'll figure it out when I get there.'' PRO FOOTBALL

''I do what has to be done, even if it's only making coffee,'' said Gelsomina Tassone. ''I guess you could call my management style 'democratic.' Our 21 employees help one another. We don't have any prima donnas.'' A & T Ironworks, a manufacturer of ornamental wrought iron and structural steel, started out a dozen years ago as a one-man iron shop in a two-car garage on Union Street in New Rochelle.\nAT the A & T Ironworks in New Rochelle, the president makes the coffee. ''I do what has to be done, even if it's only making coffee,'' said Gelsomina Tassone. ''I guess you could call my management style 'democratic.' Our 21 employees help one another. We don't have any prima donnas.'' A & T Ironworks, a manufacturer of ornamental wrought iron and structural steel, started out a dozen years ago as a one-man iron shop in a two-car garage on Union Street in New Rochelle. The business grossed $20,000 a year in its first few years of operation. This year, Mrs. Tassone estimates that A & T sales will reach the $2 million mark.\nMrs. Tassone's career illustrates how one woman has become successful in a non-traditional occupation. After a marriage ended, she held a series of part-time jobs while taking night courses at a nearby community college.\n''I certainly didn't have any image of myself as an entrepreneur,'' she said, recalling the job she took as a bookkeeper/telephone answerer for Armando Tassone in his ironworks shop. ''I was so glad to be working at a full-time job that I didn't even mind commuting 120 miles a day to New Rochelle.'' At the time, she lived in Monroe in Orange County with her four daughters.\n''I started learning as much as I could about ironwork as soon as I took the job,'' she said. ''I've always been interested in construction; my father was a craftsman who built marble altars for the Archdiocese of New York, and construction was always a topic we discussed.''\nShe moved to New Rochelle and two years later she married Mr. Tassone. She recalls that when she and Mr. Tassone first decided to expand the business, they did not think in terms of a financial plan.\n''We didn't know any bankers, we just forged ahead using our personal savings,'' she said. ''At first Armando was doing all the work manually. It was hard. But when we began to grow and the time came to buy machinery and deal with suppliers in order to expand, I followed a pattern I use to this day. I went to suppliers directly in person and asked for 60 days. Then I paid them back in 45 days. That earned us a reputation as good payers and the word got around. We were able to get credit. I'm very up front with suppliers and they appreciate it.''\nThe year 1980 marked a turning point for the small company, said Mrs. Tassone, who is 42 years old. ''We bid on a job for the New York City Housing Authority to build 125 balconies for an apartment project in the South Bronx,'' she said. ''We got the contract for $92,000. I made a deal with the supplier, who agreed to settle for a deposit until we were paid by the Housing Authority. It was our first big job and a very big one for us. Since then we've been awarded many city contracts, in addition to those from hospitals, universities and corporations such as Con Edison, International Businss Machines, New York Telephone and Anheuser Busch.\nMrs. Tassone said that a contract for $600,000 was not unusual and in order to handle the increased business, ''we bought out two other ironworks firms, Majestico Ironworks and G. Zaffino & Sons, both long-established, and we renovated the Zaffino building and incorporated the business of both.''\nMrs. Tassone, who taught herself to read blueprints and specifications, handles all the company's office work, bids on all the commercial and municipal jobs and monitors the approximately 200 job-projects the crews work on each month. She also buys all the machinery and equipment.\n''It sounds like a lot of work,'' she said, ''and it is. But my husband and I work as a team. He's happiest in the field, so he works with customers on site, and he's also our chief estimator. It's a very good division of labor.'' Although she says she seldom has a problem dealing with male employees in a business dominated by men, Mrs. Tassone acknowledged that she sometimes has a hard time explaining her role to new customers.\n''Once in awhile I get someone who refuses to believe I'm in charge,'' she said. ''No matter how hard I try to convince the caller that I was the person he wanted to talk to, he wouldn't listen, but kept saying, ''Please let me speak to someone who knows something.''\nThe considerable ''something'' that Mrs. Tassone knows has won her numerous awards from her peers. The Contractors Council of Greater New York named her Businesswoman of the Year last year. And last May A & T Tassone was a Westchester winner in a program honoring small businesses sponsored by the County Chamber of Commerce and the United States Small Business Administration.\n''I work 12 hours a day six days a week,'' she said. ''And that's not counting the mailings and correspondence I catch up with at home. If that makes me a workoholic, that's O.K. with me. Work is what I enjoy doing the most. When I see some of our completed jobs, like the structural work we did under the Brooklyn Bridge, I feel really good.''\nThe Tassones live in the north end of New Rochelle. ''We've been asked every time when we expand if we're going to leave New Rochelle,'' said Mrs. Tassone. '' 'No way,' I answer. We've expanded and modernized our facility on Cliff Street several times. We now have 20,000 square feet. And recently we were able to buy the building across the street and it eventually will become our offices. We like New Rochelle.''\nMrs. Tassone's four daughters are grown now. All of them have had summer jobs at A & T. But their mother said that she would prefer that they get jobs at other companies before joining the family firm. ''I'd love to see my girls in the business, but frankly I thinks it's better to have worked for someone else first.''\nIn contrast to the Tassones' well-established company, the owners of Audio Antics in Bronxville have just begun to carve out a place for their business in a non-traditional field.\nSusan Winthrop and Nanci Hersh, the founders of Audio Antics, said they were aware that the recent strides made by women in unconventional businesses did not always bring salaries on a par with men. So they used their musical background to form a company that produces audio cassette tapes for musicians and commercials with original musical scores for radio and television spots.\n''We were members of the same all-woman rock-and-roll band when we first met,'' said Ms. Hersh, who is an audio engineer. ''After the band broke up we began writing songs together and we tried to help actors and musicians we knew market themselves more effectively by designing labels for their tapes, doing location recordings for them and tape duplications. That's how the company started in Boston, where we were living at the time. Our first real break came when we recorded a concert of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology band.''\n''I used to play the clarinet and the bass clarinet in the M.I.T. Concert,'' said Ms. Winthrop, who is 31, ''and we offered to give the M.I.T. Concert Band a great quality recording, something they had never had before. It was a terrific success and once we had a master tape, we packaged it and sold copies to most of the players, and we were in business.''\nThe fledgling company's first two bank loans - one for a drum computer, the other for multi-track equipment - totaled $5,000. ''We got it from the Cambridge Trust Company,'' said Ms. Hersh, who is 32. ''We heard how difficult it was from other women entrepreneurs to get loans, but actually, honestly, it couldn't have been easier. Maybe we were just lucky, because we had a female loan officer who knew something about music and she encouraged us to enter what is still predominantly a man's field.''\nWhen Audio Antics moved to the New York area last year it was to be closer to the center of the music world, Ms. Winthrop said. ''The center of the recording world is in New York City,'' she said, ''but since Nanci and I both grew up in Westchester - she's from Yonkers and I graduated from Edgemont High School in Scarsdale - we decided to settle in Westchester and we found an ideal place in Bronxville. The rents were lower in Westchester and we thought the area was safer, and since we work late hours recording it was an important consideration.''\nAudio Antics' start-up costs -$20,000 - were financed privately, with the help of both women's families.\n''Most of it was needed for construction, but we kept the costs very low because we did most of the work on the studio ourselves,'' said Ms. Hersh. ''Six months ago we were ready to open for business and we went out making cold calls.''\nOne of the first calls, to a local bank, produced results. ''They listened to our tapes and we quickly got a commission to write a musical signature for them - a 60-second instrumental with a voice over. They seemed very pleased with it,'' said Ms. Winthrop.\nOriginal music commercials and jingles generate 30 percent of the company's business; tape duplication, location recording, editing and retail tape sales make up the remainder.\n''But location recording is proving very strong in this area,'' said Ms. Winthrop. ''We've picked up an amazing number of customers from music schools, including Juilliard as repeat clients.''\nHowever, the recording industry, noted Ms. Hersh, is still predominantly male. ''As an audio engineer, I still encounter a certain amount of prejudice,'' she said. ''More than once, when I show up someone says, with what I can only describe as a sneer, 'Who's the sound guy?' ''
758	LAUTENBERG GETS TOXIC-WASTE ROLE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DB1F38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A NEW role - that of Toxic Avenger - has been taken on by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg in his capacity as head of the newly created Senate Superfund Oversight Subcommittee.\nA NEW role - that of Toxic Avenger - has been taken on by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg in his capacity as head of the newly created Senate Superfund Oversight Subcommittee.\nEnvironmentalists believe that the Senator, working with a fellow Democrat who wrote the original Superfund legislation in 1980 - Representative James J. Florio of the First Congressional District (parts of Burlington, Camden and Gloucester Counties) - will greatly improve conditions in New Jersey.\n''It will help a lot,'' said Daniel Becker, legislative counsel for Environmental Action, a Washington-based lobby. ''That state is swimming in toxic waste.''\nMr. Lautenberg had asked that the watchdog subcommittee be created to assure compliance with the Superfund and other environmental programs.\n''Now with a tighter law, coupled with my new position as chairman of the oversight subcommittee, we can be much more specific about what we ask the E.P.A. [ he Federal Environmental Protection Agency ] ,'' Mr. Lautenberg said in an interview.\n''We can look at the code and say, 'This is what you were supposed to do in this period of time. Have you done it? Why haven't you done it? Or, if you have done it, what are the results so far?' ''\nThe junior Senator from New Jersey got involved with the Superfund about three years ago and was instrumental in revamping the original clManup law, which he billed as a ''sorry'' bit of legislation.\nThe first Superfund package allotted $1.6 billion to the E.P.A. over five years for cleaning up the hundreds of dump sites on the National Priority List. Nationwide, only five sites were cleaned up, and the financing ran out in the fourth year.\nThe poor cleanup record led Congress to write a tighter law that took up Representative Florio's credo of ''the polluter pays.'' The legislation also created an $8.5 billion war chest to be spent on cleanups for the next five years, and an additional $500 million was set aside to repair leaking underground storage tanks.\nOther than New Jersey, states with major waste problems include Texas, Louisiana and California.\nMr. Lautenberg fought particularly hard to keep his ''Right to Know'' language in the bill because he believes people living near dump sites should be told what they are being poisoned by.\nMr. Becker agrees that the legislation is a step in the right direction, but he believes the petrochemical industry may turn it into a ''Right to Worry'' law by using trade names to identify various chemical compounds and drowning concerned citizens in paperwork when they question the chemical companies.\nHowever, Mr. Lautenberg said he did not see this as a problem because the industry approved of the final legislation and helped to draft it.\n''We don't want to pester them [ chemical companies ] to death,'' he said, ''and we don't want to make our chemical industry noncompetitive. But we believe our citizens in every community have a right to live without fear of pollution or contamination from a nearby industrial facility.''\nMr. Lautenberg and Mr. Florio said they would concentrate their energies on New Jersey's 97 Superfund sites. They are particularly interested in the Lipari Landfill in Gloucester County, named the nation's worst hazardous-waste site.\nPoisons from the landfill ooze into a nearby lake in which residents used to boat and bathe.\nUnder the new Superfund law, municipalities contesting E.P.A. cleanup proposals can receive Federal funds to conduct their own investigations.\n''We're actually going to provide money because citizens' groups don't have any money,'' Mr. Lautenberg said. ''To ask them to try to raise a treasury in confronting the Federal Government doesn't leave them with a level playing field.''\nBoth lawmakers said they looked forward to working together; however, some staff aides on Capitol Hill hinted that jealousies might grow if the two legislators started competing for attention.\n''They could either build with each other and do something really good for New Jersey,'' one said, ''or they could compete with each other.''\nAnother aide said that Mr. Florio had the upper hand because his staff and Superfund filing system were in place, whereas Senator Lautenberg still had to develop his oversight office.\nCraig Deremer, the E.P.A.'s Congressional liaison, said that he expected to see Mr. Lautenberg ''a lot in the next two years.''\nDuring the 99th Congress, the E.P.A. testified 144 times before 57 different committees and subcommittees, Mr. Deremer said.\nMost of the oversight queries begin in the House of Representatives, and Mr. Deremer said he expected that practice to remain the same.
759	NEEDED FOR THE NEW YEAR: BOLDNESS IN PROGRAMMING	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DA1F38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Today is the last day of the New Year's weekend.\nToday is the last day of the New Year's weekend.\nTomorrow the newly refurbished Carnegie Recital Hall, now renamed the Weill Recital Hall, opens its doors. The coincidental proximity of these two events prompts a belated New Year's resolution, or better, wish, and one only partially related to Carnegie Hall and its smaller recital space.\nThat wish is: Let the overseers of our midtown, mainstream classical-music concert life be suddenly inspired with a fresh boldness and daring, with an imagination and a verve that leads to greater risks but also greater rewards. Insofar as it lies within their power to do so, let them galvanize the tired blood of New York's concert life, which for all its superficial pulsing good health has grown dangerously moribund.\nHow, you might ask, can one use the word moribund? More people than ever flock to New York concerts, and millions beyond them enjoy those concerts on radio, records and television. More and bigger are surely better.\nThe response to this is that according to a surprising critical consensus, things are looking a little moldy around the edges in our glamorous concert halls and opera houses. Gonzo radicals from the avant-garde and rock left have long mocked classical music as dowdy and irrelevant. They can still be dismissed by classical-music lovers, secure in their pleasures and their pretensions to exclusive occupancy of the high-art pantheon. But now nearly every serious mainstream classical critic is complaining, too, from the neo-conservatives to those writing in the earnest left-leaning journals, from daily newspapers to weeklies to quarterlies. The complainers all agree: something has to be done to enliven our concert life. It's the analyses and the answers that still differ.\nPart of the problem lies with classical music in general. No longer producing important new works that excite both critics and public, challenged by serious attention to other musical styles, Western classical music worldwide has suffered a crisis of creative vitality.\nSome, neo-conservatives and gloomy Frankfurt School Marxists both, believe that capitalist democracy itself is at fault. For these pessimists, the very ''success'' of latter-day classical music - its dissemination to the masses and the resultant concentration on a dead core of ''masterpieces'' and a few gaudily hyped ''superstar'' performers - has stifled creative growth.\nWhatever the merit of such general broodings, the complaints about New York's concert life relate specifically to the conservatism and timidity of New York's own presenters. Touring orchestras, chamber ensembles and recitalists are too often requested by their New York hosts to modify their programs toward timidity - to remove that nervous-making Dutilleux symphony that they have played in Indianapolis and Rochester and replace it with the Brahms Violin Concerto, say with Pinchas Zukerman as soloist. A couple of years ago, Christopher Hogwood's Academy of Ancient Music, riding the crest of its record-sales success, was asked to replace arias by the soprano Emma Kirkby with ''The Water Music,'' for fear that Ms. Kirkby wouldn't sell enough tickets.\nThe intention here is not to point fingers at individual targets. Nor is it to replace well-loved masterpieces with abrasive, unpleasant avant-garde music. No one is concentrating sole blame on some cabal of concert managers on 57th Street ordering Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center and the mighty Metropolitan Opera to ignore bright young talents and potentially popular musical revivals in favor of the same old artists in the same old repertory.\nBut whatever the analysis of its cause and the alternatives offered for its solution, there can be no doubt that the problem is real. Fortunately, there are also enough laudable examples of creative programming around town to provide inspirational models to anyone who wishes to be inspired. Harvey Lichtenstein with his Next Wave Festival has proven that actual new music and dance and theater can draw bustling crowds - to Brooklyn, no less. Omus Hirshbein has attracted ample audiences and generous funding for surprisingly varied and interesting programs all the way uptown at the 92d Street Y. Allan Miller has accomplished something even bolder (albeit more occasionally) at the run-down Symphony Space on Broadway at 95th Street.\nMidtown, circumstances and success rates of course vary. The jury is still out on Carnegie Hall, although officials there at least talk as if they recognize a need for programming improvement, especially at the Recital Hall, which has too often been a mere forum for vanity debut recitals of highly variable quality (vanity meaning paid for by the artist or his sponsors but unlikely to lead to any sort of significant career).\nStill, the apparent retreat from the ambitious plans of Seymour Rosen, the former managing director, is a cause for concern. Mr. Rosen pioneered regular concert opera at the hall, spiffy reconstructions of classic musicals and honorably intended series of jazz and avant-garde music. Many of those events were underattended or overexpensive, but they pointed toward a valuable and potentially popular role for midtown halls in the high-minded presentation of noncommercial vernacular music.\nTown Hall is still mired in indirection. Merkin Hall on West 67th Street, smaller and less expensive to rent than the nearby Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, has attracted events from both Tully and the Carnegie/Weill Recital Hall, but has established no really clear identity of its own. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, moving into the 20th century in the visual arts, offers blue-chip classical-music conservatism plus a nice dollop of early music on its concert series.\nWhich leaves Lincoln Center. The Metropolitan Opera House is given over to the Met itself and to rental attractions, mostly ballet companies. The Met has its own problems of intense, deadening conservatism in its repertory, production styles and casting, but that is a subject often lamented in these pages. At the New York State Theater, the New York City Opera shares time with the City Ballet. The City Opera is trying laudably and even successfully to shape an image for itself, and has boldly explored Broadway and quirky corners of the repertory. Not all these explorations have been carried out with the optimum taste or refinement, but at least the quest for the unusual is there. The Vivian Beaumont and Mitzi E. Newhouse Theaters have had their own troubles, but they weren't related to music.\nThus, Tully Hall and Avery Fisher Hall remain the two spaces in which Lincoln Center itself can present its own programming, under its Great Performers rubric. Both halls are devoted to other functions, as well: At Fisher Hall, the New York Philharmonic carries on its own rather insular struggle (given a subscription base seemingly impervious to questions of artistic quality) to escape the crushing ordinary. Tully Hall is still given over regularly to rentals of every sort.\nLincoln Center has a history of programming innovation. In its early years, when the composer William Schuman was running the show, all manner of bold initiatives took place, but they lost more money than the board felt comfortable raising. The summer Mostly Mozart Festival, even though it has since sunken into formula only barely varied in recent years, was an innovative step when it was new. More recently there have been token vanguard events, mostly borrowings from Mr. Lichtenstein's Next Wave roster of the Philip Glass-Robert Wilson variety.\nBut on the whole, Lincoln Center could most definitely use some bracing new ideas (symbolically, it could also use some basic maintenance, especially when compared with the spanking new Carnegie Hall: paint is peeling off the Tully Hall ceiling, the lights in both Tully and Fisher Halls still emit high-pitched whines, etc.). Staring at the center's annual season advertisements (both those of the constituents, for the most part, and most definitely of the center's own Great Performers series) is to be confronted with the current nadir of conservative programming in New York.\nCritics, it should be remembered, have no money of their own to lose in advocating such boldness; if the theaters are empty, they can just shrug their shoulders and move on to the next column. Critics also have a vested interest in the unusual, given their constant exposure to the usual. But the point here is that imagination should not be pursued out of Quixotic idealism; handled correctly, it should increase ticket sales, not diminish them.\nOf course, the serious performing arts lose money, so funds would have to be raised to offset losses. Of course, no one should charge wildly ahead of the tastes of the audience, risking empty theaters for connoisseurs' fancies.\nBut impresarios can, should and (in some already living, breathing cases) do lead, not just follow. Clearly - to judge from Mr. Lichtenstein's and Mr. Hirshbein's success - the New York audience would eagerly support more varied high-quality offerings than it now receives. The success of unusual repertory on mainstream classical record labels proves that. Certainly, any such ventures should be greeted supportively by the very critics now complaining about the staleness of our concert life.\nUltimately, we all want our concert life to be as vital as possible, and vitality can (isn't always or invariably, but can) be expressed in terms of ticket sales as well as critical approbation. If the public is excited by something - an artist, a new composer, a stage director, a concert series - it will turn up at the box office. The right kind of boldness, imaginatively conceived, presented and promoted, pays - in dollars, not just in press clippings.\nIn short, as a new year dawns and a new hall opens, Manhattan is poised and waiting for a few vital, commanding impresarios to move in here and show us how it should be done. All they need is to be given - or to seize -the opportunity.\nMUSIC VIEW
760	DAVID MAYSLES IS DEAD AT 54, MAKER OF DOCUMENTARY FILMS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDA1F38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: David Maysles, the documentary film maker, credited with his brother, Albert, as being one of the founders of the documentary genre known as cinema verite, died at Roosevelt Hospital yesterday after suffering a stroke Sunday. He was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.\nDavid Maysles, the documentary film maker, credited with his brother, Albert, as being one of the founders of the documentary genre known as cinema verite, died at Roosevelt Hospital yesterday after suffering a stroke Sunday. He was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.\nThe Maysles brothers were among the handful of film makers to first use the technological advance of the small camera - light enough to fit on a cameraman's shoulder - to capture the drama of daily experience. Their films, a form they described as the cinematic equivalent of the nonfiction novel and called ''direct cinema,'' constituted a major departure from the more traditional documentary technique of running narration and static face-to-face interviews.\nThe brothers' best-known documentaries were ''Salesman,'' which chronicled the adventures of four Bible salesmen (1969); ''Gimme Shelter,'' a record of the latter part of the Rolling Stones' 1969 American tour (1970), and ''Grey Gardens'' about Edith and Edie Bouvier Beale, the reclusive aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Onassis (1975).\nVincent Canby, film critic of The New York Times, hailed ''Salesman'' as ''such a fine, pure picture of a small section of American life that I can't imagine its ever seeming irrelevant, either as a social document or as one of the best examples of what's called cinema verite or direct cinema.'' Films Generated Controversy\nTheir films were praised for their artistry, compassion and devotion, but were not without controversy.\nThere were those who asserted that the film makers' frequently stark portrayals constituted exploitation -particularly the scene in ''Gimme Shelter'' in which a young man is stabbed to death by Hell's Angels at a Rolling Stones concert at the Altamont Speedway in California, and the candid self-revelations in ''Grey Gardens,'' in which Mrs. Beale and her daughter are photographed in their cat-infested house. The film makers, however, repeatedly defended their technique as portraying ''the truth.''\n''We have built our reputation by confronting the actual world,'' they once wrote in a letter to The New York Times. ''We have labored in each of our films to get as close to the truth as we could.''\nThe brothers were intermittently assisted by Susan Froemke, Ellen Hovde, Muffie Meyer and Charlotte Zwerin. Their other films include ''Showman,'' about producer Joseph E. Levine (1963), ''What's Happening! The Beatles in the U.S.A.'' (1964); ''Meet Marlon Brando'' (1965); ''A Visit With Truman Capote'' (1966); ''Christo's Valley Curtain'' (1974), a film on the artist Christo for which they were nominated for an Academy Award, and ''Running Fence'' (1978) another film about the artist. Other Projects Were Planned\nA third film on Christo, ''Islands,'' was completed this year. Two additional films - ''Vladimir Horowitz, the Last Romantic'' (1985), made in collaboration with Pat Jaffe, and ''Ozawa,'' made wth Deborah Dickson and about the conductor Seiji Ozawa -are to be shown later this year on Public Broadcasting Service stations.\nAt the time of his death, Mr. Maysles was at work with his brother on a number of other films, including a fourth film about Christo; a film on the author James Neuf; a film on the author James Baldwin; a film about the J. Paul Getty museum planned for Brentwood, Calif., and ''Heart,'' a documentary, in collaboration with Henry Corra, about the reversal of heart disease through changes in life style.\nIn addition, the brothers had long been at work on two feature-length documentaries: one about their family tentatively titled ''Blue Yonder'' and the other, ''Fellow Passengers,'' about long-distance trains.\nIn addition to his brother, Mr. Maysles is survived by his wife, Judith; a son, John Philip, and a daughter, Celia.\nA funeral will be held today at 2 P.M. at the Brockett Funeral Home in Southampton, L.I. A memorial service in Manhattan will be announced.
761	CONSTITUTION AT 200: POMP AND PONDERING	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D91F38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: With the first strokes of 1987, Philadelphia and the nation have touched off not only a yearlong celebration of the Constitution's 200th anniversary but also what promises to become the most broadly based examination of the American political system since the Founding Fathers met here in 1787 to fashion the country's basic charter.\nWith the first strokes of 1987, Philadelphia and the nation have touched off not only a yearlong celebration of the Constitution's 200th anniversary but also what promises to become the most broadly based examination of the American political system since the Founding Fathers met here in 1787 to fashion the country's basic charter.\nOn New Year's Eve thousands of chilled but high-spirited Philadelphians gathered at Penn's Landing on the Delaware River for the official kickoff, a midnight light show and fireworks display.\nA flood of such pageantry is in prospect here and around the country in 1987, from humble tree-plantings to what Philadelphia is billing as the biggest parade in the nation's history, and from urban street festivals to rural quilting bees to concerts and television extravaganzas.\nBut this bicentennial also bids to become a far more serious and thoughtful observance than the 200th anniversary of independence in 1976 and the Statue of Liberty's centennial in 1986.\nIn fact, scholars say a rare exercise in national self-examination appears to lie just ahead. There are widespread hopes that people at many levels, from high school classrooms to blue-ribbon groups of intellectuals and politicians, will take part.\nPartly this is because an unusual array of constitutional stresses and strains have engaged the country's attention. Not least among them are issues brought to the fore by the Iran arms affair, issues that some experts say cut to the heart of the workings of the constitutional system.\nThe Reagan Administration's secret arms sales to Iran and diversion of proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels have provoked apprehension about abuses of Presidential power. The affair has focused attention on the system's capacity for self-correction. And it has threatened serious damage to yet another Presidency after four consecutive failed, crippled or truncated Presidencies.\nDo these failures indicate a serious flaw in a system that has generally served well for 200 years? Such questions are being raised by political scientists, constitutional scholars, historians and politicians. Some wonder whether the Constitution itself, for all its flexibility and strength and its historic significance for the world, is fully up to the demands of the modern era. Can foreign or domestic policy be made and administered effectively as things stand? Are repairs and modifications called for?\nThese concerns go beyond the issues of judicial interpretation and civil rights that have frequently dominated discussion about the Constitution in recent decades. Of Relevance and Usefulness\n''The basic question facing those of us who want a serious commemoration of the Constitution is about the relevance and usefulness of the Constitution for the next 200 years,'' said James MacGregor Burns, of Williams College, the political scientist.\nProfessor Burns is a co-chairman of Project 87, a coalition of historians and political scientists devoted to such a commemoration. As part of its work, the group is to hold a forum on constitutional issues here on May 24, the eve of the 200th anniversary of the Constitutional Convention's first meeting.\nConstitutional scholars believe the convergence of all this concern in a spotlight like that of the bicentennial presents an unmatched opportunity for illumination and public education.\nThe elaborately planned celebrations of the bicentennial are to reach a high point in Philadelphia in May, maintain that level through the summer and then crest on Sept. 17, the anniversary of the Constitution's signing. But observances are to continue well beyond that. New York, for example, will have its celebration in 1988, the anniversary of its reluctant acceptance of the Constitution, and 1989, the bicentennial of Washington's inauguration as President and the convening of the First Congress.\nBoth the celebratory and ''cerebratory'' aspects, as they have come to be called by many of those involved, are to extend at least until the bicentennial period officially ends in 1991 with the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the Bill of Rights. The Search for 'Big Bucks'\nEducation is becoming the main thrust of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution. This group, headed by Warren E. Burger, retired Chief Justice of the United States, is official coordinator of the observances.\nBut many activities outside the reach of the official commission are likely to be highly commercial.\n''I can categorically say that there are organizations and individuals out there who see the bicentennial as lucrative and who have already begun hustling to see what kind of big bucks can be made,'' said Michael Kammen, a Cornell University historian whose 1986 book, ''A Machine That Would Go of Itself,'' is an examination of Americans' attitudes toward the Constitution. Of course, he said, nothing could be more American than the drive to capitalize.\nNor are fireworks, parades and festivals to be neglected. ''Without those things, this celebration will be a failure,'' said Fred M. Stein, program planner for Philadelphia's large slice of the observance. ''With just the serious, intellectual side, we will not garner the interest or support from the American public. There must be a balance.'' An Exercise in Icon Worship\nA hundred years ago, in the absence of any compelling public concern or controversy over the Constitution, the celebration of its centennial year became essentially an exercise in icon worship. ''What we got was a ritualistic, pro forma celebration,'' said Dr. Kammen, ''in which the American people said, 'Ho, hum, this is a bore.' ''\nIn 1937, the year of the Constitution's sesquicentennial, the celebration was ''anything but a pro forma ritual,'' Dr. Kammen said. President Roosevelt announced his ultimately unsuccessful plan to enlarge the Supreme Court in February that year; as a result, said Dr. Kammen, ''the people were incredibly agitated and therefore alert and interested'' in both the Constitution and the sesquicentennial.\nToday, Dr. Kammen and other authorities say, a far broader range of provocative questions have converged and aroused public interest. Academic specialists on the Constitution, for example, say they have been overwhelmed with requests for appearances. ''I've had at least 200 and maybe 300 invitations to do things relating to the Constitution,'' said Laurence Tribe, a constitutional scholar at Harvard University. ''Rather than having to get people up to speed and generate interest in the subject, I find the stage is set.''\nEvents of the last year are responsible for this, the experts say. Before the disclosures about the Iran arms affair, attention had been focused on constitutional concerns through the confirmation hearings of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court. And Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d's pronouncements on the Constitution focused it even more sharply. Reopening Questions\nOver the last few months Mr. Meese has provoked many scholars and politicians by urging that constitutional issues be guided solely by the framers' original intent; by raising the question of whether the central government has rendered the states too weak; by questioning whether Supreme Court decisions really constitute the law of the land, and especially by questioning whether the Bill of Rights should apply to the states.\n''I happen to disagree with most of the positions he's taken,'' Dr. Kammen said. ''I happen to believe he's operating from ideological stimuli and that he is committing all sorts of constitutional sins in the name of democracy. Nevertheless, I couldn't be more pleased that he has reopened just about every constitutional question imaginable.''\nThe bicentennial itself had already prompted systematic efforts to explore the Constitution and its effectiveness. Chief among these efforts, perhaps, is that of the Washington-based Committee on the Constitutional System, a nonpartisan group of scholars, politicians, educators, lawyers, labor officials and business leaders.\nThe group has been exploring a number of questions: Has the separation of powers now produced a Government so divided and incohesive that, for example, deficits cannot be reduced? Has the ability to devise and administer a coherent public policy diminished? Does a series of damaged Presidencies show that something is structurally wrong? 'Just Too Difficult to Manage'\n''We suggest that it does indicate a flaw in the system,'' said Lloyd N. Cutler, former counsel to President Carter, who is one of three co-chairmen of the committee. The others are Douglas Dillon, a former Treasury Secretary and Under Secretary of State, and Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas. Professor Burns is one of the committee's many directors.\n''It's not that we have chosen poor leaders,'' Mr. Cutler said. ''The system is just too difficult to manage.''\n''Goodness knows,'' he said, ''it has many, many virtues. But it no longer has to just protect the coast and run the post office. It now has to manage a world economy and prevent nuclear war. And it's too big. Nobody's figured out how to run anything this big.''\nSome scholars also question whether the system, in Professor Burns's words, ''inhibits Presidents from doing good things as well as bad things.'' He suggested Presidents were under pressure to get things done ''because of the tremendous political and media emphasis on action.'' So, he said, ''Along comes a Nixon in the 70's, or, we can say today, a national security group under Reagan, who smashes through the historic checks and balances and threatens the constitutional system in the ways we're familiar with.''\nProfessor Burns says ''practically no one'' thinks that a drastic change of the kind that took place in 1787 is now necessary. But many believe that modifications may be.\nThe Committee on the Constitutional System, for example, is thinking along the lines of readjusting and expanding the terms of members of Congress so as to promote coherence and stability in policymaking. As in 1787, when the Constitutional Convention met to revise the Articles of Confederation, substantial disagreement as to the extent and advisability of changes appears in store.\n''We're hoping that there will be hearings in both houses of Congress about the political structure,'' Mr. Cutler said. The committee's report is due within the next month, and the committee plans to meet in Philadelphia around Sept. 17, Constitution Day, to discuss the report's findings and proposals in a national town meeting.\nConstitutional amendments may be proposed by Congress or by a convention called on application of two-thirds of the state legislatures. An amendment requires the approval of three-fourths of the state legislatures. Although much ferment and discussion about possible amendments seem likely, no structural changes have yet been formally proposed. Imagine the Founding Fathers\nWhat would the Founding Fathers think of the system today? It is another question sure to be asked in the months ahead.\n''I think they would be amazed and dismayed by the extent of Presidential power,'' said Dr. Burns, who is an authority on the Presidency. ''And the idea that the courts would have the kind of creative policy-making power that the judiciary has taken on would have amazed them'' also.\nBut, Dr. Kammen said, ''The change that would shock them the most is the disequilibrium that has occurred in federalism. The pendulum has swung very, very far to the national extreme.'' Originally, he speculated, ''They would have said this wouldn't have worked out.'' But they would probably accept it now, he said, ''if they could have an extensive briefing session with historians and political scientists and prominent journalists and politicians and understood what kind of social, economic and technological transformations have occurred.''

''Everybody here is amazed that he was involved in something like this.'' 'Chinese Bob Hope'\nThe stabbing, before 1,200 theatregoers, has outraged the Chinese-American community in New York. Mr. Chiang, who has been called the ''Chinese Bob Hope.'' was in satisfactory condition at St. Clare's Hospital yesterday.\nFor about two weeks before the stabbing, Mr. Cordova stayed at the mission, according to staff members of the mission, who asked not to be identified. From 1980 to 1982, however, he resided at the mission, working in the group's maintenance department in return for food and shelter, the staff members said.\nAccording to witnesses and the police, Mr. Chiang, dressed at the time in a black tuxedo, was stabbed in the chest by a man who walked onto the stage as the cast of 14 actors was about to sing the finale, ''Tomorrow Will Be Even Better,'' at a benefit variety show.
763	WOMEN'S ACHIEVEMENTS HONORED	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED91F38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A trickle of stamps honoring women has turned into a steady stream befitting their emerging role in society and the history of nations.

Last year, United States issues honored black human rights advocate Sojourner Truth and women's rights activist Belva Ann Lockwood. A more traditional role was depicted on a Big Brothers/Big Sisters stamp released in 1985.\nOther countries have followed similar patterns. The most recent is from the Federal Republic of Germany. That nation has announced a permanent series that ''pays tribute to significant achievements made by women in all political, scientific and cultural fields throughout German history.'' The first two subjects were released Nov. 13. One honors Christine Teusch, who lived from 1888 to 1968. The Christian Democratic Party politician was responsible for social, women's and cultural affairs. As Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs of North-Rhine/Westphalia in 1947, she was the first woman to become a Minister in the Federal Republic of Germany. The second stamp in the new series depicts Clara Schumann, who lived from 1819 to 1896. She is considered one of the most important pianists of the 19th century. In 1840 she married the German composer Robert Schumann.\nIreland also honored ''Women in Society'' last year with a symbolic design that reflects the changing role and aspirations of women in Irish society. The design illustrates a woman surveyor. It was chosen to encourage increased female participation in the technological, engineering and industrial sciences as part of ''Women in Engineering in Ireland Year.''\nWith few exceptions, the nations of the world are now willing to philatelically recognize the achievement of their women. As a result, the once-popular ''women on stamps'' collecting topic will have to be sub-divided into authors, human rights activists or similar categories for a hobbyist to build a complete collection. The Pictorials\nThe 1869 issue included the first postage stamps from the United States Post Office that feature designs other than the heads of famous Americans. For this reason, the set is known as the 1869 pictorials.\nThe denominations and designs in the set are: 1/ head of Benjamin Franklin; 2/ post horse and rider; 3/ locomotive; 5/ head of George Washington; 10/ eagle and shield; 12/ ocean steamship; 15/ landing of Christopher Columbus; 24/ signing of the Declaration of Independence; 30/ eagle, shield and flags, and 90/ head of Abraham Lincoln.\nExcept for the 15/ issue, there are no significant design types among the 1869 pictorials. The 15/ has three varieties. Collectors considering the purchase of any 15/ 1869 pictorials should be aware of these varieties.\nThey are described as Types I, II and III. Type III can be identified by the lack of shading lines around the vignette or central design. This seemingly trivial point is important because fakers have been known to shave and regum the less valuable proofs to pass them off as valuable re-issues or even as dangerous fakes of the rare ungrilled varieties of the 1869 issue. Obtaining independent advice is suggested for all but the most expert collector.\nSome of the 1869 pictorials are found with and without grills. These grills were applied to prevent removal of cancellations and reuse of stamps for postage. The 1869 issue is usually seen with grills, while the 1875 and 1880 re-issues do not have grills. There are, however, extremely rare genuine examples of the 1869 issue without grill and not-so-rare examples with faint or pressed-out grills. The identification problem caused by the ironing out of grills is of such dimension that cataloguers and expertizers recognize the no-grill varieties only with original gum.\nBeyond these few technical factors, the 1869 issue offers a touch of nostalgia and the high values were America's first multi-colored issues. As with virtually all early United States multi-color issues, the need for two printing passes resulted in the issuance of inverted center errors.\nUsages of the 1869 issue also are very collectable. Cancellations, destinations, early usages and other variations have become the basis for award-winning collections. The 1875 re-issues genuinely used on cover are extremely rare.\nOne of the hobby's more active specialty groups is devoted to this series. The U.S. 1869 Pictorial Research Associates includes in its activities publications of journals and books on the different denominations. For further information on the 1869 pictorials and this society, collectors can contact Victor B. Krievins, Box 84, Glenside, Pa. 19038.\nThe Philatelic Foundation and the Collectors Club of New York will conduct a roundtable discussion on the re-issues of the 1869 pictorials on Jan. 21 from 4 P.M. to 6 P.M. at the Collectors Club, 22 East 35th Street. Elliot Coulter, an authority on the 1869 pictorials, will lead the group discussion, which is open to adult collectors. Auction Ethics\nThe American Stamp Dealers' Association has announced that auctioneer members of the organization have endorsed an A.S.D.A. Code of Ethics for auction firms. Jacques C. Schiff, Jr. of Ridgefield Park, N.Y., is chairman of the committee.\nAs part of the dealer group's consumer protection program, the auctioneer's code of ethics requires all qualified public auction firms to have proper licensing and adequate insurance. Full disclosure of terms of sale, auction and viewing dates and times, prices realized and consignment terms also are required. The rights of buyers to return misdescribed lots and to seek authentication of the printed descriptions also are assured.\nA.S.D.A. members who ascribe to the code will be able to use the title ''Qualified Auctioneer'' beneath the A.S.D.A.logo in advertisements and auction catalogues. A complete list of these ''Qualified Auctioneers'' can be obtained by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the American Stamp Dealers' Association, 5 Dakota Drive, Lake Success, N.Y. 11042. From Sweden\nRecent issues from Sweden honor sports achievements of its citizens and promote world peace and freedom. The Scandinavian nation's only 1986 minisheet featured track and field athletes. Ann-Louise Skoglund is shown on her way to victory in the 400 meter hurdles race in the 1982 European Championships. Dan Wennlund, a world-class javelin thrower, is shown with Eric Lemming, an Olympic medal winner at the turn of the century.\nAnother Olympic medalist seen in the set is Anders Garderud, who once held the world record for the 3,000 meter steeplechase. Patrik Sjoberg, rated as the best high jumper in the world in 1985, appears on the final stamp in the new set.\nSweden's entry in the 1986 International Year of Peace omnibus issue also honors Amnesty International. One stamp in the coil pair shows a chain being torn asunder by shackled hands. A flame representing hope burns in the background. The other stamp illustrates an olive branch sweeping away weapons in a quest for peace on earth.\nSTAMPS

So the quarterbacks, Eason for the Patriots and Elway for the Broncos, are ready for Sunday's playoff game here between New England and Denver. The winner meets the Jets or the Cleveland Browns next Sunday in the American Conference final.\nThe Patriots' other quarterback, the veteran Steve Grogan, is ready too, but no one knows what role he may play. He will, however, select the plays from the sidelines for New England and relay them to Eason, as usual.\nIt is the parts beyond the quarterbacks of these teams that remain mysterious, such as the defenses and the running attacks. Playoff Keys\nThe elements that count the most in playoff games have historically been strong defenses, reliance on running games, and the homefield advantage. The Broncos and the Patriots have lacked the first two lately and the third may be unimportant.\nDenver, the Western Division champion for the second time in the last three seasons, had an 11-5 record in the regular season as did New England. But the Broncos lost two of three games in December and their defense gave up 136 points in the last four contests, an average of 34 a game.\nNew England, chasing the Jets most of the campaign, won the Eastern Division title by defeating Miami, 34-27, in the Monday-night match that ended the regular season. The Patriots had lost twice before that game and their defense, somewhat injured, gave up 107 points in its last four games.\nAs for running with the football, the Broncos averaged 3.7 yards per attempt, the Patriots 2.9 over 16 games. The league rankings said Denver was 20th, New England 28th or last.\nAlmost two-thirds of the playoff games in the National Football League since 1970, when the present structure began, have been won by the home team.\nThe Broncos, on the grass in Mile High Stadium with a crowd of 75,000 always present, have sustained that mark in recent seasons and this year they were 7-1 here. But the Patriots, who do not care where they play, won three playoff road games on their way to the Super Bowl last season and were 7-1 on the road this season. The defeat was to the Broncos, 27-20, Sept. 28.\nThe Patriots spent the last six days at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, where Eason proved the pinched nerve in his right shoulder had healed. Something Extra\nHe is their starting quarterback and Grogan, 33 years old, accepts that. But New England has something extra in Grogan, who did such a remarkable job in winning the last game from Miami by passing for two touchdowns and running for a third after Eason was injured.\nThe Broncos, in their finale, were routed by Seattle, 41-16, a result that dismayed their coach, Dan Reeves.\nThe strategy planned by both coaches is expected to be the same. The aim will be to try to take some command early by running, but neither team has Pro Bowl choices in its backfield or anyone close to 1,000-yard runner.\nIf such running strategy fails, the game will go back to the passers.\nThe best receiver on the field will be Stanley Morgan of the Patriots and Denver has no one quite like him. The Broncos' top receiver lately has been Mark Jackson, a rookie, rather than the veteran Steve Watson.\nLinebackers' performances will be the key to the defenses and each side has big-play players, Andre Tippett and Johnny Rembert for New England, Karl Mecklenburg and Ricky Hunley for Denver.\nMecklenburg is a Lawrence Taylor type in that he lines up in different places and causes havoc regardless.\nKickers are important in playoffs, too. New England's barefoot Tony Franklin is a Pro Bowl nominee and Rich Camarillo, the punter, has been among the best for several seasons.\nDenver's Rich Karlis had a good year and the punter, Mike Horan, is the third employed this season. The edge is New England's and a small one. Otherwise, there are no edges for either side.
765	Some Glasnost Is Better Than None	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED61F38F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Just as Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan ran for President by running against Washington, so Mikhail Gorbachev seems to seek far-reaching changes by attacking the Soviet bureaucracy. He told a writers' group in June that between the people and the leadership who want change ''there is a layer of officialdom - an apparat of ministries, a party apparat - that does not want changes and does not want to lose some rights associated with privileges.\nJust as Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan ran for President by running against Washington, so Mikhail Gorbachev seems to seek far-reaching changes by attacking the Soviet bureaucracy. He told a writers' group in June that between the people and the leadership who want change ''there is a layer of officialdom - an apparat of ministries, a party apparat - that does not want changes and does not want to lose some rights associated with privileges.'' Now, his public rehabilitation of Andrei Sakharov sends an even sharper message.\nMr. Gorbachev's new glasnost, openness, has brought dramatic changes. Considering how long and how tightly Soviet society has been closed, it's tempting to stretch the possibilities. The very word has become almost a cliche for Western hopes.\nBut glasnost means two things. It is a club handed by Mr. Gorbachev to Russian intellectuals to beat economic efficiency out of the bureaucracy. It is a gate through which some wrongly imprisoned dissidents can be released and some long-silenced voices can be heard.\nThere's no contradiction between seeing glasnost as a limited opening that could be cruelly closed as Politburo interests require, and embracing it for what it also is, a breath of humanity. Nor should the West hesitate to welcome glasnost in the short run for fear it will strengthen the Soviet Union in the long run. A freer Russia might be a more formidable adversary, but it would also be a worthier one.\nFor the West, the foreign policy implications are tricky. Attempts to seize on the new policy to try to humiliate Mr. Gorbachev would surely force him into tough reactions. Attempts at positive reinforcement, in the form of trade and arms control, are not likely to foster even more openness or a more moderate Soviet foreign policy. Such thinking misconstrues the roots and goals of glasnost.\nMr. Gorbachev's underlying goal is not to install Western-style democracy, but to strengthen his rule and his country. Easing up on dissidents improves the Soviet image abroad, reinforces foreign policy aims and helps open channels to Western technology. It might also chip away at the traditionalism and immobility that drag down the Soviet economy, a phenomenon well described by Serge Schmemann in The Times as he concludes his tour as bureau chief in Moscow.\nMr. Gorbachev's version of openness falls short of Nikita Khrushchev's, although he seems to be moving faster. Mr. Khrushchev not only freed dissidents but he apologized to them. His public attacks were aimed not only at vague ''officialdom,'' but also at the K.G.B. Still, the Khrushchev internal reforms were accompanied by an aggressive foreign policy. Thus far, the Gorbachev era has been marked by a greater care at home and abroad.\nIt's a blessing that Andrei Sakharov is back in Moscow and speaking his mind. That other dissidents may be released would be a further blessing. That some glasnost exists is better than none. How much will there be? Mr. Gorbachev himself probably does not yet know how far he will go to shake his countrymen from decades and more of lethargy and cynicism.\nBut two things can be counted on. He will not, when pressed, sacrifice political control for greater economic efficiency. He will not be much swayed in his internal course by Western rewards. Trade and arms control can maintain a good climate; the West should pursue both on their own terms. Above all, the West would do well to understand the self-interest from which glasnost springs even while welcoming the humanity it brings.

He continues to embrace the idea of the state as an extended family. And he pays oratorical homage to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the last governor of New York to become President.\nWhether or not Mr. Cuomo runs for President in 1988, he's boldly claiming for himself the whole traditional, liberal side of the Democratic spectrum, territory from which other Democrats seem to shrink.\nRescuing Roosevelt from the right will be a complex task. Democrats of the Reagan era repeatedly sound like Republicans, complaining prudently about the President's ruinous policy of borrow and spend, borrow and spend. The President, meanwhile, repeatedly declares himself to be the bearer of Roosevelt's torch. He claims affinity with New Deal efforts to erase the fears of poverty and old age. He argues, as did Roosevelt, that a strong defense is the best shield against war.\nPotential Democratic candidates have sought to chart an honest cure for the vast Reagan deficits. Without asking for higher taxes, they have suggested that the country cut back its spending. They talk of reconstructing the economy to bring higher productivity at lower cost.\nGovernor Cuomo's inaugural address traces a different road map. Like Franklin Roosevelt running against the right, he will stand for no watering down of the American promise to those who cannot manage for themselves. Like Ronald Reagan running against Jimmy Carter, he will stand for no pessimistic surrender to a politics of less. He asserts his faith that the bounteous American dream is rosier than ever.\nHe promises a government shrewd enough to provide guns and butter, and compassionate enough both to mend the safety net and reduce taxes. To show that these promises can be met, Governor Cuomo points to New York, where in the last four years employment is up, taxes are down, and the state debt has hardly changed.\nSome will argue that the improvement in the state's economic position derives from Reagan policies. That claim needs to be assessed against the immensity of the Reagan deficits and the state's prosperity. If Mario Cuomo chooses to link his own national prospects to the well-being of the state, it's a choice all New Yorkers can welcome, whatever their preference for 1988.

But, the scientists quickly add, this situation may be only temporary and there is no need to worry about it for a while - a million years or so.\nNews of such trouble creates an aura different from that of other kinds of disaster. Usually, humans feel responsible for it. The sun's ailment is all its own doing, probably some sunspot upset in its metabolism. There is nothing humans can do except to feel a sort of personal concern for a heavenly neighbor.\nMankind has reason to feel kindly toward the sun. Out of the thousands on thousands of stars in the universe, it is the one that has chosen to shine on Earth. At this time of year, people feel a closeness toward the sun, perhaps because they see so much less of it.\nWe treasure the small comforts and pleasures it brings to the daily routine - the morning brightness that slants into a kitchen window, the warmth it gives in the lee of a tall building, the dazzle at the end of a workday. A look to the east sees the winter city tinted with rosy light and a look west sees an outsized sun going down into the Jersey Meadows, burnished in a halo of smoke and haze.

Brian Bosworth, Oklahoma's All-American linebacker, was sidelined because drug tests administered by the National Collegiate Athletic Association revealed anabolic steroids in his system. Mr. Bosworth's disqualification was deserved, his collegiate career rightly tarnished.\nAbout two dozen other players on bowl-bound teams also were barred for using steroids or other proscribed drugs. But Mr. Bosworth, who finished fourth in voting for this year's Heisman Trophy, captured the attention. That was fitting. He had gone out of his way to attract attention, sporting wild haircuts and depicting himself as a free-spirited maverick.\nThe Oklahoma star accepted the penalty, but pointed out in his defense that the steroids were prescribed by a physician and that he had stopped taking them in March. They nevertheless showed up in a urinalysis in December. He also pointed out - correctly - that steroids are not illegal. Athletes generally use them to add bulk and muscle strength, but they also may damage the heart and liver.\nLegality isn't the point. Steroids gave Mr. Bosworth an advantage unavailable to his opponents who didn't have access to the drugs or feared their side effects. His exceptional strength and his success were, to some extent, the product of the drugs, not hard training. That's not fair.

A winner and a loser in last fall's elections offer contrasting answers.\nAlfonse D'Amato, New York's junior Senator, was a shoo-in for re-election. He nonetheless amassed a huge kitty and, according to Federal Election Commission records, had $653,000 left over. Plans for most of it are unknown, but the Senator is spending $10,000 on self-celebration. He has reserved two Amtrak coaches to take some 200 campaign volunteers, supporters, friends and family on a two-day round trip from New York City to Washington for his swearing-in Tuesday.\nVincent Carrafiello, a University of Connecticut professor, lost the Democratic primary for west-central Connecticut's seat in Congress and wound up with a $3,842 surplus. During the campaign he had met 16-year-old John Sherwin, the grandson of some friends, passing out campaign fliers.\nThe young man's mother had recently committed suicide, and the candidate found him in despair. Now, with the election commission's approval, he has created a $3,842 trust fund for John's education.\nBoth uses of the money fall well within the law: winners are allowed to spend surplus funds on expenses as an officeholder, while losers may generally distribute them to political parties, charities or any ''lawful use.'' But where Mr. D'Amato is using his to gild a victory that was already a foregone conclusion, Mr. Carrafiello shows how to put the silver lining of triumph on a loss.

The airline said one survivor was an Ivoirian citizen and the other was from France. Other reports identified the second person as a Brazilian of Lebanese origin. The flight's destination was Rio de Janeiro. One American Among Dead\nThose presumed dead included one American, according to the airline's office in Rio de Janeiro. The other victims were from Europe, Africa and South America.\nUnited States Embassy personnel flew over the crash site, about 12 miles east of the sprawling city limits of Abidjan, the largest city in the Ivory Coast. They described the scene as devastating.\nWilly Holmes, a cultural affairs officer at the embassy, said officals reported ''there were very little traces of the aircraft.''\nHe added: ''The impact was such that the plane exploded. There was nothing there.'' Few Bodies Found Television footage from the area showed French troops and Ivoirian rescue workers searching through dense undergrowth and felled trees for bodies and debris. Soldiers later sealed off the area.\nMr. Holmes said this evening that only six or seven bodies had been found.\nThe soldiers who sealed off the area said the four-engine jetliner crashed about 300 yards from La Me River, which rescuers had to cross in knee-deep mud, near the village of Grand-Alepe.\nThey said debris from the plane was still burning. The crash also touched off brush fires.\nThe flight, carrying 39 passengers and 12 crew members, took off about 1 A.M. from the Port-Bouet airport, which serves Abidjan. The pilot immediately reported to the control tower that he was encountering problems, and then that the plane had an engine fire.\nAgence France-Presse said the pilot's last message was that he was circling to dump excess fuel before coming back to land. Inaccessible Site\nWhen contact was lost, the control tower called for help from French marines stationed near the airport under military aid agreements. Two units headed for the crash area on dirt roads, some traveling by foot.\nA French helicopter located the site when it spotted flames about an hour after the crash. Helicopters were unable to land in the jungle, but four French soldiers, including a doctor, were lowered to the wreckage and found the two survivors, Lieut. Col. Jean-Claude Blache, the unit's second-in-command, told Agence France-Presse.\nThe agency reported that the survivors were in very serious condition in Cocody Hospital in Abidjan and that one was in a coma.\nVarig's office in Rio said the jet, which was purchased in 1968, was recently sold to the Brazilian Air Force but had not been delivered.

As an idea, it was brilliant. Coming a day after five bowl games transformed America into a nation of couch potatoes, the made-for-TV game succeeded in cutting through the numbing assault of touchdowns and hype for a simple reason: The winner would be the only undefeated major team, the undisputed national champion in a sport that does not always have one. For having the foresight to realize how captivating such a game could be, NBC Sports deserves a hundred hosannas.\nEven though the network certainly was not motivated by charitable concerns, its willingness to move the game from Jan. 1 to prime time a night later created a spectacle. The winner-take-all stakes, the crowd alternately roaring and deathly still, resulted in an eerie, historical feel. Nobody seemed to know how to act. And so nobody acted. Missing, but not missed, was the stagy, rehearsed posturing and mugging for the cameras so common in television sports. We saw kids, and some adults, on the edge of genuine emotion. This was special, a desert happening that Carlos Castaneda might appreciate. What an ending!\nNBC, however, was less than flawless in its presentation. In fact, the network seemed downright schizophrenic in its approach.\nOn one hand, NBC officials promised that they would let the game speak for itself, that overkill would get a day off. Thus, the network that gave us a two-hour plus pregame show to the most recent Super Bowl limited itself to a 15-minute pregame show for the Fiesta Bowl. While that was no doubt a move dictated by dollars, it was still the right move.\nOn the other hand, the network sabotaged itself by using three broadcasters. Two are always enough. If a network doesn't have confidence that one analyst can carry the load, it should replace him, not add another. As it was, neither Jimmy Cefalo nor Bob Griese, the analysts, seemed to offer consistent insight. Back and forth they went, never seeming to hit a long, smooth patch, together or separately.\nThe extra man does not explain a snakebit sequence for Cefalo. As cameras focused on Shane Conlan, Cefalo said the Penn State linebacker was not much of a factor. Conlan intercepted a pass on the next play. Later, Cefalo said Penn State had not lost a fumble in three games. Penn State lost a fumble on the next play. Cefalo took it well. ''Again, the direct line straight down to the helmets on the field,'' he said with a laugh.\nCharlie Jones, the play-by-play man, at times seemed slow to call the action, but his raspy voice is distinct and somehow pleasant. By being enthusiastic without shouting, he also captured the drama.\nHe erred badly, though, when, over replays, he questioned an interference call against Penn State.\n''That's the kind of call that instant replay was created for in the N.F.L.,'' he said. Wrong. Only touchdowns and change of possessions are subject to instant replay. He should know that, and so should somebody at NBC who could have corrected him on the spot.\nSome of the pictures were awesome. A favorite was the replay showing that what seemed initially to be a fumble by John Shaffer, the Penn State quarterback, was actually an interception by a Miami lineman who was on the ground near Shaffer's feet. That's the stuff that can make television better than being there.\nThe goofiest part of the telecast came at halftime. While Bob Costas did a nice analysis of the first half, saying how turnovers and good punting had kept Penn State in the game despite an anemic offense, matters soon degenerated when Tom Brokaw took over for a news update. Such moves have become common for networks eager to advertise their anchormen to the millions watching sports. The idea is not really to give news. It's a hope that some of the millions will turn from now on to the anchorman they saw on the game, thus boosting that network's ratings and ad rates. That's business.\nThe problem here, however, was that Brokaw was sitting beside Costas, at the game. Usually, networks have their anchormen in the news studio for such segments. Thus, with the field behind him and marching bands blaring, Brokaw talked about, among other things, the fire that killed nearly 100 people in Puerto Rico. The effect was to trivialize the tragedy. That's carrying business too far. Halftime also brought us President Reagan from the White House. Costas said it wasn't an interview, just a chat. It wasn't really that, either, as the President went into a long story about his start in broadcasting. First Costas said he couldn't hear because of technical problems. Before long, nobody could hear as the crowd noise in the background grew louder and louder. The whole thing was such a bust that Jones, when he got the mike back, felt the need to say that all broadcasters tend to lower their voices the more they talk.\nHere's a better explanation: NBC had a lousy idea.\nNext time, let it get Brokaw and Reagan together in a quiet room, and talk about something else, say, Iran.\nTV SPORTS

774	'GOODBYE MR. CHIPS' IS WELCOME ONCE MORE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DE173BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A good many ''Masterpiece Theater'' fans evidently had something of a struggle getting through the 11 chapters of ''Paradise Postponed,'' not least because of the constant shifts between the present and different periods in the past. The attempt by John Mortimer, the writer, to break out of what he feels is the rut of chronological naturalism in most television dramas was admirable but too often confusing.\nA good many ''Masterpiece Theater'' fans evidently had something of a struggle getting through the 11 chapters of ''Paradise Postponed,'' not least because of the constant shifts between the present and different periods in the past. The attempt by John Mortimer, the writer, to break out of what he feels is the rut of chronological naturalism in most television dramas was admirable but too often confusing. Tonight at 9 on WNET, ''Masterpiece Theater'' returns to more familiar storytelling ground with a new - yes, yet another - adaptation of ''Goodbye Mr. Chips,'' the short novel by James Hilton.\nPublished in 1933, the book gave birth to one of those special literary characters who are inevitably referred to as enduring and revered. In any event, after having been portrayed in the movies by Robert Donat and Peter O'Toole, Mr. Chipping, as he was baptized, is now being given a gently virtuosic turn by Roy Marsden, perhaps best-known over here as Adam Dalgliesh in the ''Mystery!'' dramatizations of P. D. James novels.\nIn his introduction to this evening's episode, the first of the three in the British mini-series, Alistair Cooke reminds us that the year before ''Goodbye Mr. Chips'' appeared in print, Mr. Hilton was being hailed as a distinguished literary newcomer with the publication of his ''Lost Horizon.'' Then, Mr. Cooke recalls, ''he wrote this thundering best-seller and was instantly relegated by the critics to the lowly ranks of a successful popular author.'' As if that weren't enough, the subsequent film adaptations tended to sentimentalize even more than the book the character of Chips, who was based on Mr. Hilton's own schoolmaster father, John Hilton. This new version, written for television by Alexander Baron and script-edited by Terrance Dicks, generally puts things back in balance without sacrificing a single heart tug.\nOn the surface, of course, there is good old Chips, a reserved, somewhat stuffy relic of the past, still inviting the new boys at Brookfield school to tea in order to know them better and ease their passage into adulthood. He cuts the familiar figure of the demanding but always supportive favorite teacher. Beneath this comforting facade, however, Chips is always demonstrating that is he something other than what he seems. When we first meet him in 1933, he is 85 years old, long retired but still living near his beloved school and trying to write a book (''just the odd jottings'') about his life. The story is told in flashback and, happily, with chronological clarity.\nGoing back to 1870, we find the rather prim Mr. Chipping in his 20's and just about ready to admit he is a failure as a teacher since going down from Cambridge. Traipsing from post to post without distinction, he is to be given one final chance at the church school of Brookfield. Although he concedes that he does not get down on his knees to pray, Mr. Chipping insists he is ''as Christian as the next man - but no more so.'' It doesn't take long for his wards in Latin class to decide that they have a classic victim on their hands. The cutups drive him from the room and nearly from the school before he decides to stand his ground and dig in. His weapon is cricket, a sport he somehow mastered in college and now uses to subdue his young tormentors. A solution only to be found in books, perhaps, but Chipping the loser is deftly transformed into Chips the leader.\nAnd then there is the image of Chips the entrenched bachelor, seen after by his devoted house matron Mrs. Wickett (Anne Kristen). A wife could help any ambition to become headmaster, but Chips insists that he is perfectly happy as he is. That's before he meets Katherine Bridges (Jill Meager). Chips is 47; she is 23. Worse, she is a ''new woman,'' given to riding bicycles and speaking out against jingoism and colonialism. He should be shocked but is charmed. She should be bored but is intrigued, discovering that ''he argues keenly and very honorably, and he's willing to listen.'' It is Katherine who gets to the heart of Chips' character: ''gentle, quiet and warm - and steely strong inside.'' The inevitable marriage proposal is a model of economy. He: ''I am only a schoolmaster.'' She: ''It's the best thing to be in the world.'' He, falling to his knees: ''Would you do me the honor of becoming my wife?'' She, laughing: ''Honor be blowed - you love me!''\nChips surprises us again years later, during World War II, when he discovers that common sense and humanity do not necessarily prevail in the affairs of men. He is shaken by the death lists containing the names of so many former students. Always the patriot, he believes his country is fighting the good fight. But he is no blinkered idealogue. He upsets the warmongers by praising in chapel service a former German colleague and friend who has fallen on the other side of the battle. And he goes out of his way to be kind to a student who, after his brother is killed fighting and his father is returned as a basket case, decides to become a pacifist because the war is wrong. When the student is accused of cowardice, it is Chips who argues that the boy suffers from ''a tragic moral courage - greater perhaps than the will to fight.''\nThese are the unexpected twists of character that give Chips his popular longevity. Even as he resists what others might perceive as progress - where someone else sees the airplane as a device for bringing nations closer together, he would prefer to return to the stagecoach - he is uncommonly receptive to both rational argument and basic human decency. He sees the new century, our century, as vulgar and senseless in many of its manifestations, but argues only for alternatives that we can all endorse: good manners, good sense, kindness.\nDirected by Gareth Davies, this carefully measured and affecting BBC/ MGM co-production has the considerable benefits of superb performances, with Mr. Marsden confidently leading the way, and wonderfully authentic locations (many of the school scenes were done at Repton in Derbyshire, the same one used in the Robert Donat film). But the lion's share of credit still belongs to James Hilton. His little story seems to be a fail-safe classic.\nTV VIEW

The erroneous impression is thus created that ''there is no room at the inn'' for someone who cannot afford $200 a night.\nIn New York, each hotel determines its own rate, and the rates are competitive with those in other cities. In most hotels in New York City the average rate per night is substantially below the figures quoted.

778	O'ROURKE PUTS BLAME FOR CUTS ON DEMOCRATS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DF143BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: COUNTY Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke signed the 1987 budget last week but not without warning that he was holding Democratic legislators responsible for eliminating an estimated 55 county jobs that would require ''some cuts in operational services performed by the county.''\nCOUNTY Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke signed the 1987 budget last week but not without warning that he was holding Democratic legislators responsible for eliminating an estimated 55 county jobs that would require ''some cuts in operational services performed by the county.''\nHe said he was ''sorry'' that the Board of Legislators had ''cut back on the Hudson River Museum and the Council for the Arts, because they are quality-of-life issues for Westchester, and especially sorry they cut back on Youth Services because it's the wave of the future.''\nMr. O'Rourke, a Republican, said he thought the Republican majority ''did a good honest job of trying to cut back the budget in the face of the political flack they were taking from the Democrats,'' who made an issue this year of the ''phantom army'' of more than 900 unfilled but financed positions.\n''The Democrats also voted against child care, against the aged, against youth and against the budget in general,'' he said. ''I intend to campaign against them personally in this next election,'' Mr. O'Rourke vowed, saying, ''I'm going to get out there and tell people exactly what they represent.''\nAudrey G. Hochberg, a Scarsdale Democrat who took a leading role in this year's budget debate, said she would welcome Mr. O'Rourke's role in this year's county legislative campaign because, she said, it was the Democrats in some cases who backed Mr. O'Rourke's spending plan against Republican cutbacks.\n''The Democrats wanted to maintain the full $100,000 appropriation for Youth Services and the Republicans succeeded in cutting it out, and that's why we voted against the budget,'' she said. Legislator John W. DeMarco of White Plains was the only one of six Democrats on the 17-member Board who voted for the budget.\nMrs. Hochberg said: ''We even voted to restore some of the funding for the Hudson River Museum,'' where Mr. O'Rourke's proposed $975,000 allocation was cut to $500,000. ''We were willing to support it at $630,000, which was the 1986 appropriation, but the Republicans voted to reduce it to $500,000 and to say it should be phased out.''\nThe Democrat said that ''looking at the big picture, Mr. O'Rourke's budget contained a broken promise to the public, in that he had said we'd institute early retirement and use it as a way of reducing the county's work force.'' Instead, she said, he increased it by 32 jobs. ''We had an opportunity to reduce it by 400 jobs without damaging the county's ability to provide services.''\nMr. O'Rourke, as well as Edward J. Brady, the Thornwood Republican and Chairman of the Board, and Leonard N. Spano, Republican of Yonkers and Chairman of the Budget Committee, had argued in favor of retaining the unfilled jobs, both as a necessary element in staff fluctuations in a county work force of more than 8,000 and as a means of providing a fiscal surplus for unexpected expenses.\n''Those jobs are in the budget,'' the County Executive said, referring to the 55 positions cut from the budget, ''because they are intended to be filled.'' Opponents of maintaining the unfilled positions say many unfilled jobs had been vacant since March, indicating that their elimination would not reduce efficiency.\nMr. O'Rourke said he regretted that the Hudson River Museum did not have a ''constituency'' on the Board of Legislators. ''They don't appreciate the fact that this great countywide museum is very important.'' He said he would continue to do his best for the museum while ''hoping that what the Board said about cutting it down every year is not true.''\nJoyce Green, Chairman of the Board of the Hudson River Museum, said the board of directors would meet Thursday to decide what to do about the reduced financing and the prospect of the institution being eventually phased out as a recipient of county funds.\n''We have several options,'' she said. ''One is to close, another is to close partially and the third is to close the planetarium on July 4,'' when the museum's new fiscal year begins. ''Closing a planetarium is a serious matter in a county that prides itself on being a good place to live.''\nMrs. Green said that the museum had recently purchased a new Zeiss ''star machine'' for $450,000. ''We raised the money for it, but were looking to the county for operating money, about $250,000,'' she said. The museum's $1.6 million budget, she said, would represent $500,000 from the county, $400,000 from Yonkers, where it is located, $260,000 from foundations, $200,000 from corporations and the rest from individuals and other sources.\nMrs. Green said they noticed in last year's budget that the Board said it would phase out its support for the museum, ''but we thought they were saying they wanted us to work hard, and we did.'' Now, she indicated, the museum will have to plan for such a phaseout.\nThe reduction and possible elimination of funds will create new difficulties in seeking help from corporations, some of which ''say they'll hold off until they see what the county does,'' she said, and in finding a new director for the institution. ''We have several fine candidates, but with this slap in the face I don't know if they'll want to come.''\nChristopher Bruhl, the executive director of the Council for the Arts in Westchester, said that while the $285,000 allocated by the Board was a reduction from the $495,000 requested by Mr. O'Rourke, it represented an increase over the $270,375 provided for last year. ''The impact is in lost opportunities, rather than in losing organizations,'' he said.\n''Arts financing is complicated,'' he said, ''with the box office providing 50 to 60 percent of the cost of putting on a program and contributions and government grants doing the rest.'' As audience demand increases, and that is the situation in Westchester, he said, ''it becomes necessary that all parts of the pie get bigger.''\nHe said the that new or refurbished facilities in Peekskill, Tarrytown, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Pelham and other areas were stimulating greater audience demand, ''but bigger audiences only make you go broke faster unless you have other sources of financing.'' He said the county's financing for next year ''won't mean doors will be shutting, but we won't see new ones opening.''\nThe Hudson River Museum once received funds from the Arts Council, ''roughly about $30,000 a year for a decade,'' he said, ''until Yonkers pulled out and the county stepped in.'' It received $600,000 to $700,000 in county funds in recent years, he noted, which was about 40 percent of its budget. The Arts Council's $270,000 went to 65 arts organizations, representing 3 percent of a combined budget of $9 million. ''It's all a question of scale,'' Mr. Bruhl said.\nAnn Spaeth, Executive Director of Family Information and Referral Services Teams, as well as convener of the Youth Services Coalition, said she was deeply disappointed that the Board had failed to provide the $100,000 requested by Mr. O'Rourke for the agencies needing help.\n''Last year, we tried for $250,000 and it was eliminated; now the $100,000 was killed,'' she said. ''They're afraid of setting a precedent, especially during times of belt-tightening, but they don't recognize that it's sorely needed.'' She said it was the ''norm'' for counties to provide money and that, in fact, ''it's the state's intention to match county funds.''\nMrs. Spaeth said that ''we were addressing specific contracts of service'' in such areas as teen-age pregnancies, suicide and drug prevention, children of single-parent families, programs for latchkey children and problems associated with disenfranchised families.\nThe county, she said, ''had been blessed with agencies such as Boy's Clubs and the Y's that have been able to operate programs as a sideline, but everybody's missions are more specific now and the problems are greater.'' It required sophisticated staffing, for example, to deal with multi-problem families, she said.\nThe more than 50 organizations involved in providing or supporting these services have already started working on gaining support for another effort to encourage county funds for youth services, she said, and that would include efforts to gain support from town supervisors.\nLeaders of the Board's Republican majority had cited comments by Supervisor Charles G. DiGiacomo, Republican of Cortlandt, in turning down the Youth Services allocation, recalling that he said in testifying before the Board that the Youth Bureau's work was a ''duplication of efforts at the local level.''\nMrs. Spaeth said the state money that would match county funds ''would not be available to the towns; the state law says it must be used for countywide efforts.''\nMr. DiGiacomo, who had appeared before the legislators as part of a bipartisan panel of supervisors recommending budget reductions, said that the Board ''resented our appearance before them; we could feel it.'' He said he thought there would now be an ''ongoing dialogue between us.''\n''We are charged by law with collecting the county taxes, and as long as we have to do that they can rest assured that we'll say something about it,'' he said. The supervisors' principal interest this year, he said, had been to seek some reduction in the number of vacant jobs carried by the county government. ''We're pleased they responded to us and to other people,'' he said.
779	CONCERN GROWS ON REGION'S WATER	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED9143BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: IN the coming year, attention is expected to be focused on the area's water supply, a natural resource that planners in the New York City region agree is limited and requires management if serious water shortages are to be avoided.\nIN the coming year, attention is expected to be focused on the area's water supply, a natural resource that planners in the New York City region agree is limited and requires management if serious water shortages are to be avoided.\nWhile concerned county residents are calling for regional and state cooperation to seek solutions, local, state and Federal agencies have become concerned about water quality and quantity regionwide and are attempting to formulate a comprehensive water policy.\nWith few exceptions, Putnam County residents depend on private wells for fresh water, and some well-drillers, such as Henry M. Boyd of Carmel, have expressed concern that rapid development - with its blacktop, parking lots and central sewers - will cover so much of the natural landscape in Putnam County that rain cannot soak the ground and feed the wells.\nIf wells no longer suffice to supply area needs, tapping into surface-water sources may not be easy. Although Putnam County is home to a large part of the New York City reservoir system and the lakes that feed it, the cost of hooking into that system and providing the filtration to insure water quality would be prohibitively expensive, Putnam County planners say.\nA series of reports mapping and assessing the local water resources and outlining strategies for insuring a supply well into the next century are due later this year from state agencies, a regional consortium and a Westchester County task force. The first of these reports, issued last year, indicated that the region's water quality and quantity are not guaranteed, and the next 13 years are leading to ''a century of limits'' in terms of water resources.\nThe report, entitled ''Thirsty City - A Plan of Action for the New York City Water Supply,'' lists three major concerns about the reliability of a system on which 85 percent of Westchester communities depend, as do portions of 12 other counties around the state.\nConsumption is ''apparently out of control, with no adequate explanation,'' according to the report, a privately financed effort of the Citizens Union Foundation, a New York City-based organization that studies problems confronting urban areas and reports on them to the public. Hydrologists consulted in the study agreed that the system's ''safe yield'' - the amount that the 23 reservoirs feeding the New York City supply system can yield without going dry - is 1.2 billion gallons daily, but the New York City and Westchester ''draw'' has topped that figure in steadily increasing amounts over the last 18 years.\nA second concern cited by the authors of ''Thirsty City'' is the threat posed by urbanization and development. In the Croton reservoir, one of three major reservoir systems that supply the metropolitan area, the authors say ''water quality is already deteriorating.''\nNew York City is scheduled to spend an estimated $400 million to construct its first major water supply treatment plant at the Jerome Park reservoir in the Bronx to cope with impurities in the Croton system.\nThe authors are also concerned about the ''greenhouse effect,'' a global warming associated with the accumulation of carbon dioxide that scientists say could cause the ocean's level to rise, destroying groundwater aquifers and placing impossible demands on the reservoir system.\nResidents of Putnam County are concerned about the pace of urbanization and development that has caused the county's population to grow 13 percent in the last five years and an estimated 6 million square feet of office park space to be developed or proposed during the last two years. The 87,000 residents depend less on the New York City Croton reservoir system, which sprawls across large portions of their county, and more on private wells and lakes. Of the county's 87 water districts, only three are supplied by the reservoir system. Private water sources came first in this sparsely populated county, and remain traditional.\nWell-drillers such as Mr. Boyd, who digs about 300 wells a year, are kept busy piercing through the solid rock that underlies most of Putnam County searching for the seams and cracks that store ground water. The job is more difficult these days, Mr. Boyd said, because of ''lots of buildings, parking lots and roads'' that are covering the ground of the recharge areas into which rain should soak.\n''Much more of the runoff goes into the New York City reservoir system and not to our wells and lakes,'' Mr. Boyd said. He is worried about the future of Putnam County's water supply, and he added: ''Each area has to be evaluated and each acre evaluated to see how buildable it is or how valuable it is for water retention.''\nThe United States Geological Survey is conducting just such a study in Putnam County in cooperation with the county's Department of Health. Well yields are being evaluated, and all groundwater aquifers mapped. The geological survey is conducting a similar study in Westchester, and, said Steven Wolcott, a hydrologist with the department, ''not much work of this kind has ever been done in the southern New York region.''\nBut, he said, more agencies were becoming concerned about the region's water quality and supply. While refusing to speculate on the results of the study, Mr. Wolcott added: ''Whether this region is running low on water is a $2 million question. I won't say that we are, as that would cause alarm.''\nMr. Boyd's concerns about the quantity of water available to Putnam County is not shared by county officials. ''Certainly there's more usage,'' John Karell, director of the division of environmental health for Putnam County, said recently, adding: ''Remember the drought last year. Groundwater may recover at a slower rate.'' Wells in Putnam have never been dug as deep as in other counties in the region, Mr. Karell said, adding, ''I want to review the U.S.G.S. data before I make any judgments.''\nAlthough Malcolm T. Beal Jr., vice president of a well-drilling concern in Brewster, also drills wells 100 feet deeper than he did 10 years ago, he said: ''There's more than an adequate supply of water. All the concern about quality and quantity of water in the county is overstated by those who want to limit development.''\nLater this year, special reports from agencies studying water problems in the state, the New York City region and Westchester County will be issued, each addressing some of the concerns raised in ''Thirsty City.'' Among these will be a second interim report issued by the Mayor's Intergovernmental Task Force on the New York City water supply needs, a panel representing the city and all the counties in the watershed areas. The group concluded last year that use in New York City and Westchester already exceeded the system's safe yield and that consumers would require an additional 200 to 300 million gallons a day by the year 2000. The group has been studying ways to increase that water supply and to assess demand by 2030.\nSalvatore A. Celona, director of the county's Water Agency, which represents Westchester in all water-related issues, is a member of that New York City task force, one established in 1985 in response to the drought. The current work of the intergovernmental task force, Mr. Celona said, represents an intelligent response to demands for growth in the region. ''This panel will allow us to use water wisely,'' Mr. Celona said, ''rather than allowing it to manage us.''\nWestchester County is developing its own internal water-management plan, Mr. Celona said, with the help of a water-management task force established by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke early last year. That group, which includes commissioners of planning, health and environmental facilities, is considering such questions as whether the county needs an agency to set guidelines for controling storm water runoff, and its report is due in September.\nNear the end of the year, a report will be issued detailing a systematic statewide approach to managing the state's water resources for present and future needs. Established by an act of the State Legislature in 1984, the Water Resources Management Strategy Program, using resources of the state's Health Department and its Department of Environmental Conservation, is looking at key facts about sources and supplies in 13 sub-regions of the state, examining policy issues, and is expected to recommend a strategy for providing an adequate water supply for the state's needs through the middle of the next century.\nMeanwhile, Putnam planners, drillers and residents continue to focus debate on the county's concerns about water, wells and development. One Putnam County planner, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ''The whole water issue is a kaleidoscope, and it's difficult to pinpoint where the real problems lie. This issue is not a 'Chicken Little-type thing.' The sky is not falling, but we are concerned, and we are studying the situation.''

However, in mentioning ''that the news media, most of all television, mesmerize the population and its politicians with these melodramas,'' he neglected to mention the complicity of all the players in this dynamic. It is a maxim of hypnosis that you cannot ''mesmerize'' the unwilling.\nFor six long years, the media played to the mass audience the lines it yearned to hear: ''The President is popular . . . so likable . . . the economy is rebounding . . . we have recovered,'' creating the context for the President's power and Rambo-like arrogance. They did the same thing in reverse to Jimmy Carter, repeating enough times, ''He's weak . . . he's weak,'' until the public was sufficiently programmed to believe, without much thought, that President Carter's restraint, reflectiveness and compassion were tantamount to weakness.\nAs for the polls, mesmerized zombies regurgitate the myths with which they themselves have been programmed.\nIt has been a tribute to the intelligence of the American public that a sizable minority of citizens all along refused to be ''mesmerized.'' But minorities do not win elections, and all of us are stuck with leadership determined by the media myth-makers and myth-breakers, not by properly informed voters. TIMOTHY WRIGHT New York City

Mary Tyler Moore, wearing a bright red dress, exudes the nervous crackling energy of a thoroughbred stamping at the starting gate. Lynn Redgrave, clad in black, projects an amiable reserve, gazing impassively through cornflower blue eyes and speaking in soft, musically rounded cadences. As Ms. Redgrave reclines, Ms. Moore leans forward and chatters with the emphatic enthusiasm of her most famous television character, Mary Richards. Her brown eyes snap as she flashes her wide, eager-to-please grin.\n''What the critics see in New York will be substantially different from what the critics saw here,'' she says of the play ''Sweet Sue,'' scheduled to open Thursday at the Music Box Theater on Broadway. ''The consensus was that the play was funny but missing some depth. Two days after the reviews, the changes started coming one after another, and they have been wonderful. Without losing its laughs, the play has become a lot more serious.''\nA. R. (Pete) Gurney Jr.'s bittersweet comedy, about a suburban woman in her late 40's who falls in love with her son's Dartmouth College roommate, earned mixed reviews for its author and accolades for its co-stars when it began out-of-town tryouts in Boston early last month. In the play, Ms. Moore and Ms. Redgrave both portray the same character, Susan Wetherell, a successful designer of Hallmark greeting cards who loses her heart to handsome, 22-year-old Jake. The character of Jake, like that of Susan, is played by two actors - John K. Linton and Barry Tubb - who interact with the two Susans in an emotionally tumultuous roundelay whose outcome - do they or don't they consummate their love? - is left tantalizingly unclear.\nBantering, debating, agonizing, jumping together through emotional hoops of desire, uncertainty, exhilaration, fear, jealousy and tenderness, Ms. Moore as Susan and Ms. Redgrave as her alter ego, Susan Too, create a composite larger-than-life portrait of a mature woman in the throes of belated first love but battling it tooth and nail.\nThe notion of having two actors simultaneously playing the same character is not new. Eugene O'Neill did it in ''Days Without End,'' and it was the central device of Peter Nichols's ''Passion Play.''\n''Pete Gurney described the concept by likening it to Picasso's renderings of two-faced women,'' Ms. Moore explained. ''Though she is the same woman, each face is a different aspect. I actually think we all have 10 or 20 different voices in our heads that are alternating continuously. In 'Sweet Sue,' the differences are not written but are in the playing. One of us isn't the good one and the other the bad one or anything so obvious.''\n''The differences come out of the fact that Mary and I are two very different people projecting different versions of what Susan is,'' Ms. Redgrave added . ''I think that the role could be taken by two other people and played legitimately but in a totally different way from how we're doing it.''\nOf the two actresses, Ms. Moore identifies with the character more directly.\n''She's a little like I am and a little like the roles I've played before, including 'Ordinary People,' in that she is a product of what she was trained to be and to do,'' Ms. Moore reflected. ''In one speech, Susan says that she was brought up to believe that if you play by the rules and wait long enough and have been a good girl, you get your reward - that everything will fall into place and make sense. Of course, life isn't like that. But through her relationship with the boy, she discovers that if she lets go a little and allows something to happen that doesn't have a beginning, middle or end, it can free her as a woman and an artist.''\nMs. Redgrave's vision of the character is a bit more abstract. ''Though I haven't played a woman like Sue before, I know who she is,'' she said. ''For me, one of the saddest sights is people who are full of if-onlys. Susan is one of those if-only people who, until she meets Jake, has been unable to let the floodgates open.''\n''Sweet Sue'' is the first play by A. R. Gurney Jr., the author of ''The Dining Room,'' ''The Middle Ages,'' ''The Perfect Party'' and other dramas that delineate the manners and foibles of prosperous White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Americans, to make it to Broadway.\nMs. Moore became involved with the play last summer when it was first presented at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Williamstown, Mass.\n''I was coming off a failed TV series and a badly reviewed movie [ ''Just Between Friends'' ] , and I was hurting,'' she recalled. ''I needed to get back up on a horse quickly, and so I called my old friend Nikos Pscaharaopoulos, at Williamstown, since he had been saying for years that we should work together. He brought me the play to read, and I loved it immediately. Originally, I thought it was going to be a summer project. I never expected it would move to Broadway.''\nOnce Ms. Moore became involved, the production, which had started out as a second-stage feature at the festival, was transferred to the company's main stage as a work-in-progress, with Maria Tucci, a Williamstown Theater company member, playing opposite her.\nMs. Redgrave was attracted to ''Sweet Sue'' for several reasons. ''I had been looking fruitlessly for a long time for a new play as opposed to a classic,'' she explained. ''I get offered a lot of dead authors and a lot of English imports. Either the plays aren't very exciting, or I feel I'm being asked to play a character I've played before, which would be easy but boring. I've done American plays before, but until now I have not been part of the playwright's process. I did 'Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,' but only after someone else had had the fun of working with Chris Durang. It's hard for me to do a play in New York, because I live in southern California and have children of varying age ranges, but this play is so intriguing and unusual that I couldn't pass it up.\n''I also have this theory about acting - that it is like a muscle, which will atrophy if it is not regularly exercised,'' she continued.\nOne of the fascinations of watching Ms. Moore, who just turned 50, and Ms. Redgrave, 43, perform together, is in seeing two women of vastly different backgrounds and temperaments merge into the same person. While Ms. Moore's Susan is more theatrical and openly sensual than Ms. Redgrave's Susan Too, it is the latter's reserves of sweetness, strength and subtle humor that help put together Ms. Moore's shattered world once Jake leaves her for a woman his own age. The interaction brings to mind the struggles - both personal and professional - that Ms. Moore and Ms. Redgrave have weathered..\nIn 1980, the year she won acclaim both for her movie portrayal of Beth, the unyielding mother in ''Ordinary People,'' and the hospitalized quadriplegic in the Broadway play, ''Whose Life Is It Anyway?'' Ms. Moore lost the only child of her first marriage when he accidentally shot himself. Her second marriage, to the television executive Grant Tinker, was also at an end. Ms. Redgrave grew up the youngest member and the shy, frightened ''ugly duckling'' of a famous theatrical family. Although her international success 20 years ago in the movie ''Georgy Girl,'' made her famous, it also typecast her in the public mind as a pudgy kook pushing a baby carriage. It is a stereotype that the svelte, elegant actress must combat even today, after having appeared on the New York stage in such varied and demanding vehicles as ''Black Comedy,'' ''Mrs. Warren's Profession,'' ''Aren't We All?,'' and ''Saint Joan.'' ''Saint Joan'' was directed by her husband and manager, John Clark, with whom she lives a comfortably rustic life, filled with children and animals, in the hills outside Los Angeles.\nMs. Moore also has the mixed blessing of having to live up to an image that will never change so long as there are reruns of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' - that of the ideal single career woman. Three years ago, Ms. Moore married her third husband, the New York cardiologist Robert Levine. . The couple recently bought a country house and two horses in upstate New York hunt country. Despite the failure of her television series ''Mary,'' Ms. Moore is planning another show for this coming fall. ''It will be character relationship comedy,'' Ms. Moore says, ''as opposed to one-joke comedy, which unfortunately was the style of the last go-round.''\nOn the stage, Ms. Moore and Ms. Redgrave have found a synchronicity that allows each to step into the other's shoes.\n''One night I was late with an entrance because of a wardrobe change that didn't allow me enough time, and I missed it,'' Ms. Moore recalled. ''When I finally made it onstage, Lynn was saying my line. I pointed to her and said, 'Exactly,' and it worked. One night before the end of the run, we plan to make the grand experiment and swap roles.''

What is to be done about such undisciplined growth? Roote the plantlets and share the bounty.\nA well-grown spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum) will send out many runners with small plantlets at the ends. What is to be done about such undisciplined growth? Roote the plantlets and share the bounty.\nThis formation of plantlets is the spider plant's means of perpetuating itself. For gardeners, thses miniatures are an opportunity to learn one f the basics of plant propagation. Once this method is mastered, there are other ways to multiply house plants and bring new life to old ones tha have become straggly and overgrown.\nIn the horitcultural world, the little spider plants on the ends of the runners are called offsets. All these plantlets need are roots to be on their own. In the wild this rooting would take place naturally when the plant runners touch soil. To make this rooting happen at home, you'll have to provide some encouragement. Set the spider plant on the floor or on a table and fill small pots with commercial potting mix. Water the pots thoroughly and drain them in the sink. Fill as many pots as there are little plantlets. * With the mother plant in the center, stretch out the runners to reacht he pots and fasten each plantlet on top fo the soil with a paperchip or large staple. But do not cut it off from the runner. Be sure to keep the soil int he satellite pots moist, but not soggy. In a few weeks, roots will form and the plantlets can be severed from the runners. Also each runner should be cut off from the mother plant. The older spider plant will look new and can be rehung and grown normally. Each rooted plantlet will match the mother plant in characteristics. Other house plants that send out runners with plantlets include episcias, strawberry begonias (Saxifragra stolonifera) and pick-a-back (Tolmiea menziesii). The same rooting methods apply. In the case of pick-a-back, which form plantlets on the tops of leaves, sever the leaf from the plant in insert leaf stem and plantlet in a pot filled with potting mixture. After roots form, the leaf will wither away.\nSome house plants form offsets which huddle close to the base of the parent plants rather than on long runners. Among them are bromeliads and clivias. These offsets can be separated from the parent plant and grown ont heir own, but they should not be cut off until they are about one-quarter the size of the parent. Use a sharp knife to sever them carefully and hopefully roots will be attached. * Some gardeners would rather remove the parent plant from its pot and lay it on its side for this operation. Then the offsets can be cut from the parent plant and potted individually. The main plant is returned to its pot with fresh soil. With either method, the offsets are potted individually in a quick-draining potting mixture. They will form a sturdy root system and can be grown as new plants.\nMastery of these simple steps should encourage a novice to go on to more complicated plant propagation which includes rooting cuttings. Pieces can be taken from the stems of plants (tip cuttings) or stem sections of foliage plants can be placed horizontally on damp rooting media. New plants can also be encouraged to grow from leaves of begonias and African violets.\nRooting cuttings is probably the most rewarding. In a way, it is also themost frustrating as there is not always 100 percent success. Some cuttings simply fail to root.\nA few basics apply to the propagation of common house plants. Rooted cuttings or slips will be identical to parent plants. This means of propagation secures the species as a clone and it is also faster. Many palnts do not form viable seed. If they do, seed has two disadvantages: it takes longer and it produces innumerable variables. Offspring of open pollinated seedlings are never identical. Most commercial foliage plant operations that depend on volume and time schedules rely on rooted cuttings to produce their stock fast.\nThe tools needed for successful rroting of cuttings are a sharp knife to sever the cuttings from the parent plant, pots scrubbed clean, a light but no sunny location and a quick-draining rooting medium. As to the kinds of pots to use, either plastic or clay are fine as long as they have drainage holes. If the plastic pots do not have drainage holes, use a hot nail or screwdriver to punch holes in the bottoms or along the sides.\nFor the rooting medium, perlite, an expanded form of volcanic rock, is used. It is full of tiny holes which hold water, resembles tapioca and is lightweight. Other gardeners prefer a heavier mixture of half coarse sand (never use fine beach sand) and peat moss. Commercial rooting mixes are also sold at garden centers. Before any cuttings are inserted, however, the rooting medium should be wetted thoroughly. Stems must never be inserted into a medium that is dry. As to the length of cuttings to take, there is no rule. Much depends on the mother plant and what kind of trimming it may need. Cuttings are usually anywhere from two to six inches long. Those of succulent-leaved plants such as coleus should be covered with wet paper towels to prevent wilting, while those of thick-leaved plants such as cacti, jade adn geraniums should be allowed to dry overnight before they are putinto the rooting medium. This drying will also help the callus, a kind of scab, to form over the wound and spur rooting.\nCommercial rooting hormone powders should not be necessary to spur rooting although those who root woody-stemmed house plants such as gardenia do find these powders helpful. Trim off the bottom leaves so the cutting stems are clean. Insert them gently but firmly and settle them inby using a fine mister to rewet the rooting medium. PolYethylene bags put over pots of cuttings hold moisture in and prevent them from drying out.\nAnd one final point. Don't be tempted to peek. The cuttings willk start to form new leaves when they are rooted. This will be time enough to open the plastic covering adn pot the cuttings individually.

At the National Boat Show, 16 lenders have taken space, ready to write loans on new or used boats for as little as $3,000. Five years ago there were just a handful of lenders, and they wouldn't talk to you unless you were financing a new boat with a loan of more than $25,000.\nFinancing a boat has never been easier. At the National Boat Show, 16 lenders have taken space, ready to write loans on new or used boats for as little as $3,000. Five years ago there were just a handful of lenders, and they wouldn't talk to you unless you were financing a new boat with a loan of more than $25,000.\nEven though every kind of loan imaginable is being written, including variables, interest caps, floating rates and balloons, most smaller boat loans (under $25,000) are fixed-term, fixed-rate financing. Buyers want to know how their boat fits into their budget, without any surprises.\nThis year, buyers may find that their monthly budget will enable them to finance a bigger boat. That's because interest rates have come down even lower, and boat loans are now being written for longer terms. Lower Monthly Payments\nGeraldine Waltz, an executive vice president of Essex Credit Corporation, says that at last year's boat show, she made loans at 11.5 percent for a maximum of 15 years. Financing $50,000 resulted in a monthly payment of $584.09. This year, she says, Essex is making loans for 20 years at 9.4 percent. Financing the same $50,000 this way brings the monthly payment down to $462.81.\nBankers are learning to like boats. Unlike cars, boats don't depreciate rapidly. In fact, a 10-year-old fiberglass boat, routinely maintained, is probably selling for more today than it did in 1977. And bankers love boaters. Not only is the default rate far lower than for auto loans, but boat owners tend to be better potential bank customers.\nGreg Proteau, an executive director of the National Marine Bankers Association, says boat owners tend to have a better credit profile and a better net worth. Banks believe that by writing a boat loan, they will be able to sell the customer other bank services.\nActing on that belief, Chemical Bank this year wrote a boat loan program tied into checking account services. Fierce Competition\nWith the competition among lenders so fierce, it pays to shop around. ''With all the lenders at the boat show,'' Proteau says, ''you'll quickly get a feel for what is available.''\nIt may also pay to talk to your tax adviser. While the deductibility of consumer loan interest will be phased out by 1991, smaller boats can be financed, within limitations, as part of a home equity package, with the interest cost fully deductible.\nSome larger boats may qualify as a second residence. Arthur Goldstein, a tax manager at Arthur Young, quotes from the Internal Revenue Code regulations on vacation homes: ''The term dwelling unit includes . . . (a) boat . . . which provides basic living accommodations, such as sleeping space, toilet and cooking facilities.''\nHoward Sample, a New York partner at Price Waterhouse, says Treasury Department regulations specifically cite the example of a ''boat suitable for overnight use.''\n''This is generally interpreted,'' he says, ''to mean a boat with a berth, a head and a galley.'' In other words, don't expect to qualify a 16-foot fishing boat just because you occasionally spend the night out trolling for blues.\nSample points out that qualification as a second dwelling means that you can deduct both the interest cost and any personal property tax. He goes on to say that although there is no authority yet, you have a good argument that the interest cost on a condo boat slip would also qualify for exemption.\nIn short, even though the sales tax deduction has been lost, boat owners have fared better than most taxpayers. Geraldine Waltz, of Essex Credit, thinks tax revision may help the boat industry.\n''People who enjoyed boating but never owned a boat, may buy one now,'' she says.

Mostly Navy men, and all instantly recognizable by their haircuts and accents, they prowl the pubs and shops for a few days before returning to sea.\nThe Pentagon counts on ports and other installations in Australia, which have taken on greater importance recently. Events in the Philippines have raised doubts about the future of American bases there, while New Zealand has refused to allow nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships to call. That puts greater burdens on Australia, where the most frequent port of call for warships is Perth.\nBusinesses love the free-spending visitors, and some other Australians seem equally enthusiastic. A welcoming service allowing families to offer home-cooked meals to young Navy men has been dubbed ''Dial-a-Sailor,'' because it is sometimes used by local women to get dates.\nMany Australians, like Miss Gibson, find this distasteful and say the sailors tend to be rude. This criticism was amplified when a guidebook to Australian iniquity, published by some sailors, was discovered and reprinted in part in local newspapers.\nAustralia's anti-nuclear movement is concerned about nuclear-armed or -powered ships visiting Australian ports. Critics, particularly in the small Nuclear Disarmament Party, say that Australia's ties to the American Navy would make it vulnerable to nuclear attack in time of war.\nAside from rare disturbances, most American sailors seem to leave a good impression. ''They're good blokes,'' said Phil Tapsell, a sporting goods salesman in Perth. ''You can get soused with them. Of course, it's different for a lady.'' Barbecues and Beaches\nIt is summer in Australia, a gorgeous summer of sun and sand and clear blue skies. Despite campaigns against skin cancer, Australians are on the beaches in force, basting their skin with tanning oil as they barbecue themselves.\nIt is illegal to bring the ''barbie'' to the beach, so after Australians are a chocolate brown, they retire to their backyards to throw steaks, sausages and onions on the grill.\nThe surfing culture is giving way to wind-surfing, with young men and women using huge sails on surfboards to propel themselves at 20 or 30 miles an hour. Scores of bright sails color the vista in some bays.\nColor also comes from the zinc sunscreen creams that have become popular on the beaches. The white cream has largely given way to bright blue, red and yellow creams that adorn the noses of many young beach-goers. It is one of the few signs that Australians are concerned by the consequences of their reverence for the sun, including one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world.\nAustralian beachgoers may have bright red noses this time of year, but the reindeer do not. After a century of interpreting Christmas in traditional themes of snow, sleighs and a well-wrapped Santa, Australians are beginning to develop their own version of Christmas traditions.\n''We're only just switching from Northern Hemisphere Christmas cards with Santa and snow and reindeer,'' said Malcolm Bryce, Western Australia's Deputy Premier. ''It doesn't snow here, and we don't have reindeer. So on cards we're now seeing kangaroos pulling sleighs instead of reindeer.''\nChristmas Island, an Australian territory, went even further with a recent issue of postage stamps. They depict Santa Claus fishing, riding a power boat, relaxing in a deck chair and playing golf.

The merger wave is continuing to roil key industries. Slow, or non-existent, growth and falling prices are forcing some sectors into a new pragmatism.\nIn oil, commercial real estate and agriculture, owners are becoming more willing to sell out at what seem to be fire-sale prices. In entertainment, hard-nosed business executives are cutting costs.\nWith all this, short-term interest rates are likely to dip even further as the Federal Reserve pours money into an economy limping into its fifth expansionary year.\nWhat follows is a look at what could prove to be some of the more interesting sectors by business and economic correspondents of The New York Times.\nIN the automobile business, the spotlight has turned to trucks. As sales of passenger cars have grown annually at a mere 2 percent over the past decade - barely keeping up with the increase in the nation's population - light-truck sales have almost doubled. They reached 4.8 million in 1986, up from 2.5 million in 1973. Forecasters say the trend will continue for the rest of the decade.\nBut these days, a truck is not what a truck once was, a strictly commercial hauler of workmen and materials. Today's light trucks include mini-vans that transport children and groceries, pickups that are cheaper and more fun to drive than austere economy cars, and four-wheel-drive sports utility vehicles that combine the virtues of a station wagon with those of a Jeep.\n''It's become a second car, a utility vehicle,'' said Robert C. Stempel, chief truck executive of the General Motors Corporation. ''Our customers like their performance and load-carrying capability as well as the passenger conveniences.''\nConveniences, indeed. Today's trucks come equipped with plush upholstery, power assists, air conditioning and fancy sound systems. Sizes have proliferated, as well. The Japanese started selling mini-pickups at mini prices when all the Big Three had to offer was their standard size - that is, big pickups.\nNow the pickups come in small, medium and large sizes, and new entrants, such as the Suzuki Samurai, a compact off-road vehicle, have found eager markets.\nIn fact, their popularity with the general public is changing the way trucks are being designed. Market researchers estimate, for example, that four-wheel-drive ''off-road'' vehicles are taken off paved roads no more than 10 percent of the time. So when American Motors replaced its venerable Jeep CJ model with the Wrangler this year, the change was mostly to improve on-road handling. When the new G.M. full-size pickup is introduced in April, it will be described as ''dual purpose - a pickup for daytime work and nighttime play.'' HOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987

Potential buyers were reluctant to pay anything over $6 a barrel for proven reserves, while most sellers were seeking substantially more.\nBut the action is likely to pick up, now that prices are expected to stay above $16 a barrel, at least for the early months of 1987. (The new price outlook stems from OPEC's recent limited-production pact.) Buyers of proven reserves are starting to pay more. Sellers, meanwhile, seem willing to accept less; their hope that crude prices will top $20 a barrel in the near future has been dashed.\nA couple of the oil industry's better-known mavericks are already moving. In October, Robert O. Anderson, the 69-year-old retired chairman of Arco, joined forces with Roland W. Rowland, of Britain's Lonrho Group, to buy about 600 oil and gas properties in the Rocky Mountains and Southwest from Arco. The price was not disclosed, but Mr. Anderson said most of the $180 million that he and Mr. Rowland have allocated for buying American reserves will go toward the Arco properties.\nAnd in his latest play for proven reserves, T. Boone Pickens, the chairman of Mesa Limited Partnership, last month offered to buy the Diamond Shamrock Corporation, with its large reserves, for an estimated $2 billion in shares. He dropped the offer after Diamond threatened a court battle against him, though some analysts believe Mr. Pickens might renew his bid.\nOf course, like all plays in the oil business, the proven-reserve game carries high risks and big stakes. Investors who pick the right properties today ''will make themselves very wealthy in the long run,'' said Henry T. DeNero, a partner in Los Angeles with McKinsey & Company's energy consulting group. But, he adds, it may take another five years before the winners become apparent.\nHOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987
795	REPORTER FIGHTS TESTIFYING AT TRIAL IN MURDERS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DB123BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A New Hampshire newspaper reporter faces a charge of contempt of court if he refuses to show up in Maine on Monday and testify at a murder trial there.\nA New Hampshire newspaper reporter faces a charge of contempt of court if he refuses to show up in Maine on Monday and testify at a murder trial there.\nThe legal dispute grows out of interviews the reporter, Robert Hohler. conducted in June 1985 with Richard Steeves, who goes on trial Monday for two murders in Maine. At the time of the interviews, Mr. Steeves, who is now 43 years old, was in the New Hampshire State Prison forensic unit here.\nMr. Hohler, who is also a columnist for The Concord Monitor, says he will not testify because he is appealing a New Hampshire court order that he testify at the trial in Knox County Superior Court in Rockland, Me. Article Sought as Evidence\nMr. Hohler says he should not be forced to testify about statements, openly obtained from Mr. Steeves, that were published in an article in The Monitor. The Maine prosecutors want to use the article as evidence in their action against Mr. Steeves. ''The information contained in the article is sufficient evidence,'' said Assistant Attorney General Thomas Goodwin of Maine, ''but in order to put that information into the trial I need a witness.''\nAlthough newspapers customarily fight to protect confidential sources, none of the information in the article was based on such sources.\nBut The Monitor and Mr. Hohler argue that forcing the reporter to testify could cast him in the position of becoming an arm of the law. They say that the New Hampshire courts should tell the Maine authorities they should gather their own evidence rather than rely on information that journalists produce independently.\nMr. Goodwin, the prosecutor, said it was essential for Mr. Hohler to testify if the article was to be submitted as evidence, because no one else was present at the interview. ''It's our duty to gather every bit of critical evidence, not to leave anything out,'' the prosecutor said. ''This may well be an essential piece of evidence.'' Court Session on Custody\nIn a hearing here Friday in Merrimack County Superior Court, Justice Arthur Bean refused to have Mr. Hohler taken into custody, as Maine prosecutors had wanted. But the judge noted that he ordered on Dec. 30 that Mr. Hohler should testify in the Maine matter and that that order was still in effect because the New Hampshire Supreme Court had not yet decided to accept the appeal.\nMr. Steeves is accused of the April 1984 slaying of Russell Bailey, 69, and Harry Staples, 83, who was killed in 1965. Both men lived in Wells, Me., not far from the New Hampshire border. Each killing in which Mr. Steeves was implicated, including some in the 1960's, involved beating, the police said; Mr. Bailey was also shot, but the bullet wound was not the cause of his death.\nIn 1965, Maine prosecutors felt the evidence against Mr. Steeves in the Staples case was insufficient, but they now say they have enough evidence.\nThe Maine Attorney General's office, in its effort to get Mr. Hohler to testify, forced him to appear in the New Hampshire court two weeks ago to be identified as the writer of the article. Deteained for 18 Years\nBefore the interview, Mr. Steeves was incarcerated for nearly 18 years at the New Hampshire State Hospital forensic unit in Concord in connection with murders committed in the 1960's. He was released in 1984 on the basis of the authorities' assessment that he had recovered from mental problems and had become an example of recovery and rehabilitation. A year later he was back in custody. 'I Think I'm Innocent'\nIn the article, published June 12, 1985, in The Concord Monitor, Mr. Steeves was quoted as saying:\n''I'm not well enough to say what really happened. I think I'm innocent in one way, but in another way, I don't know. My mind's all screwed up.''\nHe was also quoted as telling Mr. Hohler, apparently speaking of the Bailey case:\n''I think I saw someone else kill him, but on the other hand, I have a dream that I see myself doing it, I'm not sure. I do know the guy wasn't killed for money. He did something sexually, and somebody did something to him.''
796	PROGNOSIS GOOD AS THE PRESIDENT FACES OPERATION	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA123BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: President Reagan spent a quiet day at the White House today, on the eve of entering the hospital for two medical procedures: a colonoscopy on Sunday and prostate surgery on Monday.\nPresident Reagan spent a quiet day at the White House today, on the eve of entering the hospital for two medical procedures: a colonoscopy on Sunday and prostate surgery on Monday.\nExperts say the odds are high that the President will come through the two common procedures with no major difficulty, and it was business as usual for much of today as Mr. Reagan discussed the budget in his weekly radio address and signed the budget that will be delivered to Congress on Monday. Small Risk of Complication\nAs of midnight tonight, the President will have nothing to eat or drink in preparation for the two procedures. On Sunday morning, he will take a 15-minute helicopter flight to the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.\nThe colonoscopy and prostate operation are standard and safe, the experts say, though they add that small risks of complication are always present.\nA cancerous polyp was removed from Mr. Reagan's colon in 1985, and although major problems are not expected, cancer specialists point out that this is a critical period: when colon cancer reappears, often elsewhere in the body, more than two-thirds of the time it is within two years. The risk of detecting such recurrence at this checkup is estimated at about 5 percent.\n''Something could show up,'' said Dr. Sidney J. Winawer, an expert in colon cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. ''He certainly is in that period when it could.''\nAnother possibility - and again, the chances of its occurring are relatively small - is that doctors could unexpectedly find prostate cancer. Chances of discovering that are generally regarded as about 10 percent, and such a finding would not necessarily be ominous.\nA team largely from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., will perform the procedures in conjunction with doctors from the White House, the Navy and private practice. Mr. Reagan is expected to return to the White House in midweek.\nThe President, who will turn 76 next month, has undergone periodic cancer checkups at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center since his colon surgery.\nBut the prostate surgery is a surprise. After Mr. Reagan underwent a two-hour urological examination for undisclosed symptoms last August, Dr. T. Burton Smith, then the White House physician, said the tests revealed ''no abnormalities'' or evidence of disease. X-Rays Are Scheduled\nOfficials have not said what symptoms Mr. Reagan has experienced from his enlarged prostate, a condition called benign prostatic hypertrophy. Common ones are being awakened in the night to void urine, voiding smaller amounts but more frequently, and a sense of urgency to urinate.\nDoctors not connected with Mr. Reagan's case said that the chances are remote that Mr. Reagan's urinary symptoms are connected to any recurrence of the colon cancer.\nSuch a recurrence would probably be painless, producing no symptoms, and most likely could be detected only through medical tests. Doctors have drawn blood samples from Mr. Reagan at the White House about every month for one such test, a CEA (for carcinoembryonic antigen), and the results are understood to have been continually normal. Many doctors, however, believe the CEA test is not always conclusive.\nThe President is scheduled to have CAT scan X-rays of his abdomen and pelvis as well as a colonoscopy, a procedure in which a flexible fiberoptic tube is used to examine the entire length of the colon. This is particularly necessary in Mr. Reagan's case because his cancerous polyp, removed a year and a half ago, was located at the beginning of the colon, at its junction with the small intestine.\nThe X-rays and colonoscopy are being done for different purposes. The CAT scans are primarily aimed at detecting any possible spread of Mr. Reagan's colon cancer to the the liver and the lymph nodes in the abdomen and pelvis. The colonoscopy, which will be performed by Dr. Robert W. Beart Jr. of the Mayo Clinic, is primarily to prevent further colon cancers by detecting and removing newly formed benign polyps.\nDoctors have come to believe that many benign polyps can become malignant and they have found that individuals who have one polyp are prone to form additional ones. Doctors have already removed five small benign colon polyps during the two colonoscopic procedures Mr. Reagan has undergone since his cancer operation.\nAt that time, Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, who is chief of cancer surgery at the National Cancer Institute, said Mr. Reagan had a greater than 50 percent chance of outliving his cancer for five years, the standard period used to measure cancer survival, and some experts believe that the prognosis should have been stated more positively.\nBut recurrence and spread of the colon cancer, if it did occur, could have ominous implications for Mr. Reagan's long-term survival. The British Medical Journal, noting the lack of an accurate way of detecting recurrent colon cancer at its earliest stage, said in an editorial: ''Many patients who die from cancer of the bowel have previously undergone what was hoped to have been a 'curative' resection, only to return with lethal recurrent or metastatic disease.'' The American Cancer Society estimates that colon cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, killed 51,800 Americans last year. Awake During Prostate Surgery\nAssuming no serious problem arises from results of Mr. Reagan's tests Sunday, the prostate procedure will get under way about 9 A.M. Monday with an anesthetic injected between the vertebrae in the lower spine. A few minutes later, while Mr. Reagan remains awake, two urologists, Dr. David Utz of the Mayo Clinic and Dr. John Randolph Beahrs of St. Paul, Minn., who trained at Mayo, will begin what is called a trans-urethral resection of the prostate, or TUR. A long tube called a resectoscope will be inserted through the urethral opening to the prostate, a walnut-size gland that exists only in men and that surrounds the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder.\nOne urologist will look through a wide-angle lens at one end of the resectoscope to examine the lobes, or sections, of the enlarged gland. The instrument has an electric wire loop that the doctor, by pressing separate pedals with his foot, can use to chip away prostate tissue and to stop bleeding. The aim is to remove all of the obstructing portion. It is impossible to remove the entire prostate with the resectoscope; hence tissue can regrow and benign prostatic hypertrophy recur.\nThroughout the operation gallons of fluid will flow from bags hanging from a stand about two feet above Mr. Reagan to bathe and cleanse the operative field. In a separate step, the removed prostate tissue is flushed out and strained so that it can be examined for any signs of malignancy. Risk of Absorbing Fluid\nAs is normally done, an anesthesiologist and other doctors will monitor heart rhythm and vital signs. They will also watch for mental confusion, which could be an indication of water intoxication from absorbtion of the bathing fluid. Doctors often monitor the amount of sodium in a patient's blood during or just after the operation; low sodium levels indicate that too much fluid was absorbed, and doctors inject a strong solution of salt water to correct the problem.\nThe amount of fluid absorbed usually correlates with the length of the surgery, but this varies widely. If too much is absorbed, as occasionally happens, and it is not corrected, the resulting overload could cause not only temporary mental confusion but also heart failure and other potentially lethal problems. Seriousness of Prostate Cancer\nThe time it takes to perform a TUR varies according to such factors as the size of the gland and the amount of bleeding - it usually takes less than an hour. As soon as the anesthetic wears off, usually in a few hours, Mr. Reagan will be able to move about.\nThe trans-urethral resection carries small but significant risks of subsequent bleeding, infection, urinary incontinence and impotency. Bleeding usually stops after a few days, but in rare cases it recurs and can lead to serious complications such as a heart attack.\nWhen pathologists examine prostate tissue in men over 60, there is about a 10 percent chance that they will find cancerous cells. ''Statistically, the older you are when you have any kind of prostate surgery, the greater the chance of finding a cancer in the tissue removed,'' said Dr. Russell W. Lavengood, a urologist in New York City.\nThe seriousness of the finding and its treatment would depend on the nature of the cells that pathologists see through the microscope. Such prostate cancers are commonly what are called well-differentiated cells, not particularly virulent and in small clusters. Such a situation ''is not dangerous'' because the cancers tend to be very slow-growing, said Dr. Mircea Golimbu, a urologist at New York University Medical Center.\nIf cancer cells are found in the prostate, Mr. Reagan and his doctors will then face a decision that experts say is rooted more in philosophy than medicine. Statistically, men over 75 who have cancer of the prostate are more likely to die from some other cause, according to Dr. William Fair, who is chief of urology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.\nGenerally, Dr. Fair said, there are three options for patients with cancer of the prostate: to do nothing because it may grow so slowly as to constitute little danger; to treat with radiation, or to remove the entire prostate and surrounding lymph nodes.\nGenerally speaking the medical community is optimistic about the President's health. Physicians who have cared for him have been struck by his resiliency, noting how well he came through chest surgery after he was shot and the colon operation. And Dr. Ralph Bookman, who gave Mr. Reagan allergy shots in Los Angeles last week, said: ''He looks remarkably well.''

The shuttle was to serve as the primary means of getting commercial satellites into orbit. And its payload bay was the experimentation center for companies trying to make everything from perfect ball bearings to drugs in the weightlessness of space.\nAt various times, entrepreneurs announced plans for private launching services. But most were grounded by their big competitor - the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA, fearful of losing business for a shuttle system that was just barely cost-effective, kept the prices it charged for lofting payloads artificially low.\nNow, for the private-launching industry, it looks like the only thing worse than the presence of the shuttle is the absence of the shuttle.\nPresident Reagan's new space policy, which bars NASA from putting most commercial payloads on shuttle flights, would appear to give a green light to private launching efforts. But with no domestic launching capability in place, major satellite owners -like Comsat, Intelsat and Western Union - have been scrambling to get aboard Europe's Ariane flights.\n''If there is room for an American competitor, and we think there may only be room for one, it could be whoever wins the MLV contract,'' said Brad Meslin of the Cambridge-based Center for Space Policy, referring to the Air Force's new medium-launch vehicle. The multibillion-dollar contact should be awarded in the next few months. And the winner - the contenders include Martin Marietta, Hughes Aircraft and McDonnell Douglas - will wind up with a production line in place, making it far cheaper to sell variants of the rocket for private satellite launchings.\nThere is also a race on for another unmanned rocket: The Pentagon's ''heavy lift'' vehicle to take very large ''Star Wars'' payloads into orbit. Boeing has already proposed a craft that uses many of the features of the shuttle's propulsion system.\nJust how quickly American aerospace companies should jump into the fray, however, is unclear. Some are afraid of getting burned on Government programs that are later cut by Congress. And the demand for private launching services may decrease by 1993 as the sky fills with more than enough communciations-satellite capability, say several experts, making many wonder whether it is worth the investment.\nHOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987

799	SPENDING CUTS IN MANY AGENCIES BUT RISE FOR NASA TO BE PROPOSED	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D9123BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: President Reagan's new budget seeks to cut spending for the Departments of Education, Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Interior and Transportation, but it would give a big increase to the space agency, according to confidential budget documents.\nPresident Reagan's new budget seeks to cut spending for the Departments of Education, Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Interior and Transportation, but it would give a big increase to the space agency, according to confidential budget documents.\nMr. Reagan indicated today that he was prepared for a battle over the budget with the Democratic-controlled Congress. In his weekly radio address, he warned lawmakers: ''You can't have it both ways. You cannot decry deficits and then pass budget-busting legislation.''\nShortly after the address, he signed the budget he will submit to Congress Monday. It calls for spending $1,024.3 billion in the fiscal year 1988, which begins Oct. 1, and projects a deficit of $107.8 billion, just below the target set by law for the year. NASA Growing to $11 Billion\nIn the last few days, education officials disclosed that Mr. Reagan would request a major increase in an experimental student loan program. But the budget documents show that the overall budget of the Education Department would decline steadily, from $16.8 billion this year to $14.7 billion in 1988 and eventually to $12.4 billion in 1992.\nAccording to the documents, the budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would rise from $7.9 billion this year to $9.5 billion in 1988 and then would remain around $11 billion in each of the next four years.\nSpace agency officials said some of the money was for a shuttle orbiter to replace the Challenger, which was destroyed last January. The budget also seeks more money for a manned space station and a small unmanned spacecraft to orbit Mars and look for water, the officials said. Increase for Nicaragua Battle\nMr. Reagan will also ask Congress to increase the budget of the National Science Foundation, from $1.6 billion this year to $1.9 billion in 1988 and $2.2 billion in 1989, with further increases to $3.2 billion in 1992, the budget documents show. The agency supports research in science and engineering, which Administration officials say is important to America's competitive position in world markets.\nThe budget documents also show that Mr. Reagan will ask Congress to provide $105 million in aid next year for the rebels trying to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua. That is $5 million more than the amount Congress provided for this fiscal year.\nThe Administration apparently envisions a sustained commitment to the rebels, or contras, as they are known. The budget documents show spending of at least $110 million a year in aid to the contras from 1989 through 1992.\n''We will not abandon the contras,'' James C. Miller 3d, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a television interview Friday.\nBut lawmakers from both political parties have said Mr. Reagan should not expect to get any new aid for the rebels this year, at least until questions are answered about money sent to them from the sale of American weapons to Iran. Even some Administration officials have acknowledged the obstacles ahead.\nThe budget, no longer a blueprint for action by Congress, has in recent years become, as Mr. Reagan said today in his radio address, ''a plan, a hope, a vision of what America is and of where America is going.'' Cut in Current Farm Spending\nMr. Reagan calls for a 32 percent reduction over five years in the Agriculture Department budget, from $55.1 billion this year to $50.7 billion in 1988 and $37.6 billion in 1992, according to the documents. This cut would come at a time when American ''agriculture is in the worst recession since the 1930's,'' Representative E. (Kika) de la Garza, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Agriculture Committee, has said.\nThe documents show that Mr. Reagan will also ask Congress to cancel spending already approved for this year for many rural assistance programs.\nIn his radio address, Mr. Reagan said, ''We will spend more than ever for America's elderly, for law and drug enforcement, for AIDS research, for health care and for air traffic safety.''\nCongressional staff members said they understood that Mr. Reagan would request $471 million for activities related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 1988, up from the $410 million appropriated by Congress for this year. These amounts include $286 million for biomedical research next year and $248 million this year. Later Increases for Energy\nNone of those figures include costs that may be covered by Medicare or Medicaid, the health programs for elderly and disabled people and for the poor.\nOther documents show that Mr. Reagan wants to reduce the budget of the Commerce Department from $2.4 billion this year to $2.3 billion in 1988 and eventually to $1.9 billion in 1992.\nSpending by the Energy Department would decline slightly, from $10.6 billion this year to $10.2 billion in 1988 under Mr. Reagan's proposal. But it would rise in later years, in part because of additional spending related to nuclear weapons. The budget for ''atomic energy defense activities'' would rise from $7.4 billion this year to $7.8 billion next year and then to $9.6 billion in 1992.\nThe Interior Department's budget, the documents show, would decline from $5.2 billion this year to $4.4 billion in 1988 and would remain around that level for the next four years.\nSpending by the Transportation Department would decline from $26.2 billion this year to $24.6 billion next year under Mr. Reagan's proposal. It would rise slightly in the next four years, but would not return to this year's level.\nMr. Reagan will also ask Congress to cut spending by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Actual outlays would decline from $14.6 billion this year to $13.9 billion next year under his proposal. The department's legal authority to make loans and enter long-term contracts would be cut even more, from $14.2 billion this year to $10.2 billion in 1988. $2 Billion More for Star Wars For the Defense Department, Mr. Reagan proposes a major increase in spending for research, development, testing and evaluation of weapons, from $36.7 billion this year to $43.7 billion in 1988. These figures include a $2 billion increase for the Strategic Defense Initiative for a space-oriented defense against nuclear missiles, popularly called ''Star Wars.'' Under Mr. Reagan's request, the program would get $5.2 billion next year.\nThe budget documents show no major increase in spending on military research and development from 1989 through 1992, but the budget for buying weapons and military equipment, after declining from $85.8 billion this year to $84 billion next year, would rise rapidly, to $94.6 billion in 1989 and to $123.3 billion in 1992.\nMembers of Congress from both parties have already indicated that Mr. Reagan is unlikely to receive all he seeks for Star Wars.\nThe budget documents show that Federal spending on food stamps would decline from $12.7 billion this year to $12.5 billion next year under Mr. Reagan's request. The budget for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which provides food to pregnant women and young children from low-income families, would decline from $41.5 million this year to $34.9 million next year.\nFederal spending on a program under which schoolchildren from low-income families receive milk free or at a reduced price would decline from $19.5 million this year to $2.2 million next year, the documents show.\nOther child nutrition programs would decline from $4.1 billion this year to $3.7 billion next year. Congress has resisted similar proposals in the last five years.

Manhattan's Woody, dismissed at 37-1, outdueled Schism, the 7-2 second choice, by a nose for second place, and Schism's stablemate, Bourgeois, was a head back farther back in fourth.\nUncle Cam, the George Steinbrenner-owned 9-5 favorite, was forced wide and finished a dull seventh in a field of 13. Only a length separated the second through eighth finishers, and the others were strung out far up the track.\nThe winner, a Florida-bred son of Baldski and the Nashville mare Nashantess, paid $20.80 for $2 and covered the mile and an eighth under Craig Perret in a moderate 1:54 4/5 over the slow and sandy Calder track. Owned by the Five Star Stable and trained by Manuel Estevez, Baldski's Star was winning for the fourth time in eight career starts.\nThe first three finishers all prepped in divisions of the What a Pleasure Stakes here Dec. 21. Baldski's Star won the slower division while Schism beat Manhattan's Woody by a length in a split that went four-fifths of a second faster. Tropical Park Derby Jinx\nThe Tropical Park Derby is the first Triple Crown prep of the year and the first graded stakes for 3-year-olds. No Tropical Park Derby winner has gone on to glory in the spring classics but such also-rans as Creme Fraiche and Proud Truth blossomed later in the year.\nOne race earlier, Arctic Honeymoon, a claimer at Belmont just three months ago, scored his third straight Florida victory with a 1 1/2-length upset decision over Smile in the $167,500 Tropical Park Breeders' Cup Handicap. The winner, a new horse since being turned over to the trainer, Luis Olivares, rallied from far back to nail the even-money favorite inside the final furlong. Smile, making his first start since winning the Breeders' Cup Sprint Nov. 1, held second place by nine lengths over Darn That Alarm. The winner carried 114 pounds, 8 fewer than Smile, and set a track record of 1:59 3/5 under Robert lester for the infrequently used distance of a mile and three-sixteenths.\nToday's rich races began a cluster of major stakes races that conclude the Calder meeting. The Sunday feature is the $200,000 La Prevoyante Invitational Handicap, at a mile and a half on the grass for 14 older fillies. Bonne Ile, who won the Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita Nov. 2, carries top weight of 121 pounds, 5 more than Lotka and Carotene.\nCalder closes with the $200,000 McKnight Handicap Wednesday, the males' equivalent of the La Prevoyante. Flying Pidgeon will be favored to win the race for a third straight year. Hialeah opens its 50-day meeting Thursday, highlighted by the Flamingo Stakes Feb. 28, the first Grade I Derby prep of the year.\nHORSE RACING

Microcomputer technology has stepped aboard, and if the products on display at this year's National Boat Show are any indication, technology is here to stay.\nAlmost no segment of the marine field is as exciting as that of today's electronics. Microcomputer technology has stepped aboard, and if the products on display at this year's National Boat Show are any indication, technology is here to stay.\nThis year's trends are more evolutionary than revolutionary. The marine computer continues to be one of the hottest pieces of electronics gear, and manufacturers appear to be making an effort to introduce new, easier-to-use designs and improve existing ones.\nIn addition to growing smaller, less expensive and more user-friendly, electronics equipment has gotten smarter. Integrated systems allow complete interfacing between most modular instrumentation on board, and with compact liquid crystal display (LCD) and analog sensors, the navigator can have all the information he needs at his fingertips, whether he is at the helm, at the nav station or up on the bridge. Instrumentation that existed as recently as five years ago was too esoteric, bulky, costly or unreliable, but now is within the financial and operational means of the average boat owner.\nThere are several manufacturers of marine computers, many of whom are exhibiting their wares at this year's show. Most units provide certain standard informational fare, such as depth, speed, distance, wind speed, apparent wind speed and angle, velocity made good and magnetic heading.\nSome units offer clocks that read in nautical time; speed and distance averaging, water temperature, depth and anchor alarms and, for racers, a countdown timer that automatically computes minutes and seconds left till the start.\nOn exhibit this year from Plastimo is the Saiing Computer, which processes navigational information and acts as a ''tactician,'' letting the helmsman know when to tack or what course to steer to best advantage. Like most other computers, the main unit can be extended with remote digital repeaters and can interface with other navigational equipment such as SatNav. The price is $1,650, with additional remote units available at added cost.\nFrom Brookes and Gatehouse is another new computer for sailors, the Hercules 390. This system delivers up to 62 channels of information, including tidal set and drift, target boat speed and optimum wind angle. Prices range from $4,795 for the Basic Pack to $6,995 for the more elaborate model.\nOther systems that can be seen at this year's show are the Link 5000 and Link 6000 from Datamarine and the Smart Pak from Signet Scientific. Applicable for both power and sail, these units provide a wealth of navigational data on one main screen. All have the ability to interface with modular remote display units that can be added according to the whim or budget constraints of the buyer.\nA key word in computerized high-tech gear this year is ''interface.'' Worthy of note are instruments that will interface between navigational receivers and various types of autopilots.\nInternational Marine Instruments is showing their new Windvane Converter. This device provides the interface between Kenyon Microline Wind Systems and Autohelm autopilot systems, enabling the masthead-mounted wind vane to transfer the information to the autopilot and steer the sailboat either to apparent wind angle or compass course. The price for the system is $1,447.\nThis year's developmental trends are also evident in the more complex navigational gear that is on exhibit. Apelco Marine Electronics, a division of Raytheon, has added an interesting feature to one of its newest compact loran sets, called ''Loran-See.'' The set provides a LCD chart of the coastline, including landmarks and navigational aids. The user's boat appears on the screen as a blinking symbol. With a cursor, markers can be placed on the screen to indicate waypoints or other chart markings. A dotted trail appears astern to mark the boat's path. The cursor can also be used to draw a course. The cost is $1,395.\nThe computerization of marine electronics has even filtered down to traditionally more back-to-basics navigational instruments. One such notable new product, which can also be seen at the I.M.I. booth, is the Lokata 7 handheld radio direction finder (RDF). This little piece of gear is a perfect example of design evolution.\nBOAT SHOW

The merger wave is continuing to roil key industries. Slow, or non-existent, growth and falling prices are forcing some sectors into a new pragmatism.\nIn oil, commercial real estate and agriculture, owners are becoming more willing to sell out at what seem to be fire-sale prices. In entertainment, hard-nosed business executives are cutting costs.\nWith all this, short-term interest rates are likely to dip even further as the Federal Reserve pours money into an economy limping into its fifth expansionary year.\nWhat follows is a look at what could prove to be some of the more interesting sectors by business and economic correspondents of The New York Times.\nAS the farm crisis forces more and more farmers to give up their land, the turmoil is producing an unexpected twist: growth in absentee ownership. Investment-minded doctors in Des Moines and lawyers in Chicago, hoping that the agricultural cycle has bottomed out, are buying up land.\nWhile they wait for land prices to rise, these investors are renting out the land to farmers, some of whom already have their own farms, some of whom are merely tenant farmers. ''Iowa land that once sold for $2,500 an acre now goes for $800, which enables these investors to make a decent rate of reurn,'' said John A. Schnittker, a former Under Secretary of Agriculture.\nOvercapacity in rural America is making this absentee ownership possible. With the nation's grain exports having plummeted since the glory days of the 1970's, agricultural overcapacity has resulted in dismally low grain prices. This is slowly and painfully squeezing out marginal operators. The shakeout will cause the number of commercial farmers to fall to 450,000 in five years, down from 600,000 now, says Mr. Schnittker.\nIf there is a silver lining to all this, it is that the upheaval will force American farm goods, helped by the weaker dollar, to become more competitive on world markets: Farmers who survive will be able to produce at lower prices.\nStill, no one expects agricultural America to make great strides over the next few years in regaining lost market share in the global grain trade - unless there are major commodity shortages in China, the Soviet Union or elsewhere. Much capacity has been added in competing countries like Brazil and Australia. And many nations are heavily subsidizing their farm sectors, though there will be stepped-up pressure to reduce those subsidies in future trade talks.\nSays John K. Hosemann, senior economist with the American Farm Bureau: ''We built this mess we're in over six to eight years, and it will probably take six to eight to work it out.''

The National Fisheries Institute reports that the value of annual seafood sales is already approaching $20 billion. And fish entrees already bring supermarkets $860 million a year.\nNow food processors will try to make those numbers even bigger, as they concentrate on both the high and low ends of the fish market. Some companies will try to get more profit per ounce by marketing fish entrees as specialty foods that command premium prices. Gerard's Haute Cuisine, for example, a Vermont caterer with retail outlets in some large department stores like Bloomingdale's in New York, is offering vacuum-packed poached salmon and grouper-creole entrees for up to $7 a portion.\nOther processors will offer new -and in some cases, lower-priced -products. A Japanese process called surimi creates imitations of crab, lobster and other expensive seafoods from lower-cost fish. Consumers are beginning to accept the imitations and even some non-fish eaters are beginning to try surimi-based foods in which the fish is well disguised. One example is ''crab'' stuffed pasta shells. Demand for surimi - both imported and domestic - is expected to reach 200 million pounds this year, up from just 3 million pounds in 1980.\nConsumption of cold-water fish, such as herring, is also expected to rise sharply this year, as the major drug companies begin their aggressive promotions of fish oil as a dietary supplement.\nHOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987

Icahn, who took control of Trans World Airlines in 1985 and who is now its chairman, already is talking with airlines about possible mergers or acquisitions.\nAnd if financially ailing Pan American World Airways puts its North Atlantic routes on the block - as is widely expected - the auction likely would attract a slew of bidders. Almost certainly Frank Lorenzo, chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, would be among them. Mr. Lorenzo, who is still struggling to digest his '86 takeovers of Eastern Airlines and People Express, is not one to let a bargain go by. The prices he paid for Eastern, $676 million, and for People, $115 million, were rock bottom.\nDelta Air Lines is another possible bidder. Despite its acquisition of Western Airlines in 1986, it lacks the size and resources of Texas Air, which has begun to compete directly with Delta in its prime Eastern routes. And Texas Air's bigger size and resources enable it to offer greater frequency of flights and more connections from its hubs. One way for Delta to get an edge would be to buy Pan Am's international routes -or buy a domestic airline.\nUnited Airlines, which bought Pan Am's Pacific routes last year is another potential bidder for Pan Am's Atlantic routes. Such an acquisition would make it the dominant international carrier in all three of the world's major markets - the United States, Europe and the Far East.\nHOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987

The police said three black women were wounded, one of them seriously.\nThe explosion, the first in the city center since a series of bomb explosions in June, went off in shrubbery against a wall at the offices of Sanlam, an insurance company run by businessmen from the nation's dominant Afrikaner minority.\nIt shattered windows in nearby apartments but appeared to have caused little major damage. The police cordoned off the area, barring reporters from inspecting the site. Television crews were barred from filming the scene.\nNo group immediately took responsibility for the explosion. In earlier instances, the authorities have blamed the African National Congress, the insurgent organization whose headquarters in exile are in Lusaka, Zambia.\nA state of emergency was proclaimed in South Africa to combat black unrest that has claimed more than 2,300 lives since September 1984. The authorities sought to justify the newest tightening of the emergency decree, which outlaws virtually all forms of peaceful protest or dissent, by saying the African National Congress planned a Christmas terror campaign. The explosion today was the first reported since then. Rift With Cabinet Minister\nIn a separate development, President P. W. Botha was reported on state-run radio today to have delivered a sharp rebuff to a mixed-race Cabinet minister, the Rev. Allan Hendrickse, and to have renewed his commitment to the maintenance of racially segregated residential areas.\nMr. Hendrickse is one of two non-whites in the South African Cabinet and leads the segregated parliamentary chamber for people of mixed race in the nation's racially based, three-chamber Parliament.\nOf the country's four main racial groups - whites, blacks, Asians and those of mixed race - blacks are not represented, and the mixed-race and Asian chambers, which were elected in a 1984 vote marked by widespread abstentions, lack authority to overrule the white, Afrikaner-dominated chamber.\nMr. Hendrickse told a convention of his Labor Party on Friday night that he might have to resign from Parliament if Mr. Botha refused to scrap legislation demarcating separate residential areas for the different racial groups.\nMr. Botha was quoted by state-run radio today, however, as saying that ''Government policy is to retain exclusive suburbs for the different population groups.''\nLast year, the South African leader had hinted that an easing of the legislation, called the Group Areas Act, might have been on the agenda of his program of cautious racial change.\nBut, confronted with unabated violence and protest in segregated black townships, the program has all but stalled.\nAdditionally, Mr. Botha has announced elections for the white chamber of Parliament. Commentators say they expect him to avoid any action that might be interpreted by his constituents as weakness or appeasement.\nThe South Africa radio said Mr. Botha had denied that the Group Areas Act had been disputed in the Cabinet and termed his response to Mr. Hendrickse's threat a ''repudiation.''\nThe radio said Mr. Botha maintained that no system that deviated from the notion of ''group identity'' was acceptable. ''Group identity'' is a cornerstone of apartheid, reflecting the official contention that South Africa is a land of ethnic and racial minorities that should not be permitted to dominate one another.\nMr. Botha's statement seemed certain to erode the already frayed credibility of both the three-chamber Parliament and of Mr. Hendrickse, who joined the legislature saying he wanted to fight apartheid from within and would quit if this proved impossible.

807	INVESTIGATORS SEEK TO SOLVE MANY PUZZLES IN HOTEL FIRE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D7123BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Investigators tried today to narrow the search for answers to the many puzzling questions concerning the New Year's Eve fire at the Dupont Plaza Hotel.\nInvestigators tried today to narrow the search for answers to the many puzzling questions concerning the New Year's Eve fire at the Dupont Plaza Hotel.\nOn one question at least, Federal arson investigators said that no evidence of structural damage consistent with a bomb had been uncovered.\nThe possibility of a planted bomb was uppermost in the minds of many hotel guests who reported hearing two or three ''explosions'' emanating from the hotel in the first minutes of the fire.\nThe police said today that they had been warned of a bomb threat or other form of assault at the hotel on Wednesday, just 90 minutes before the fire broke out. But the comments of the Federal investigators seemed to cast doubt on that theory.\nThree days after the fire, many other questions remain unanswered over the sequence of events leading up to the calamity, its cause and what transpired in the fateful minutes after it was first discovered. Arson or Negligence? At the heart of the mystery is whether the fire was set or if it was an accident, one perhaps caused by negligence. If it was set, what was the motive and what consequence was desired? If it was by negligence, what conditions contributed to it and what individuals could be held liable as a basis of claims against the hotel's designers or its owners?\nPolitical terrorism by anti-American, pro-independence groups has generally been directed against government and military installations or personnel in Puerto Rico, not average citizens or tourists. Yet Puerto Rican terrorists have been behind indiscriminate acts of terrorism on the mainland United States, most notably the January 1974 lunchtime bombing of the Fraunces Tavern in Manhattan in which five patrons were killed and 80 injured.\nPolitical and tourism leaders in Puerto Rico have been quick to say there was no political motive behind the Dupont Plaza disaster. But Federal investigators will not discount a possible link until they have a chance to take a close look at the bitter labor dispute at the hotel.\nInvestigators will almost certainly want to question Jorge Farinacci, a San Juan lawyer who was negotiating a labor contract with the hotel on behalf of Local 901 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 250 of the hotel's workers. Was at Meeting at Hotel\nMr. Farinacci was at a meeting of about 100 union members in the hotel's beach-level ballroom at 3 o'clock Wednesday afternoon to discuss a last-minute contract offer before a midnight strike deadline, according to the hotel management.\nMr. Farinacci is currently free on $1 million bail after his indictment in 1985 on a Federal charge growing out of the 1983 robbery of $7 million from a Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford, Conn. Twelve other defendants in that case have been linked to Los Macheteros, described by Federal officials as a Puerto Rican terrorist outfit. Los Macheteros has taken responsibility for several terrorist attacks, including the 1979 machinegun attack on a Navy bus in Puerto Rico that killed two sailors and wounded 10 others.\nMr. Farinacci has denied any connections with terrorists.\n''We want this fire to be investigated as fully as possible since we are dealing with a national tragedy,'' Mr. Farinacci said today. ''Only a madman would deliberately do something like this.''\nDupont Plaza officials said the fire broke out in the downstairs ballroom immediately after the close of the union meeting, in which last-minute negotiating strategy had been discussed.\nBomb threats, work slowdowns and other acts of harassment have been tactics employed against hotels in past Puerto Rican labor disputes that have dragged on beyond the normal arbitration process and deteriorated into enmity, distrust and conspiracy. These tactics are designed to place economic pressure on the hotel to settle the dispute or suffer the consequences when guests complain about bad service or fear that their personal safety is being compromised. Chronic Shortage of Towels\nA guest who survived the Dupont Plaza fire said that in the week preceding it he and others had been made acutely aware of the labor dispute and the impending New Year's strike deadline.\nMany guests recalled a chronic shortage of towels, which could have been a result of a work slowdown or just a condition of what happens when a 423-room hotel is fully booked in a holiday week. ''Some of the other guests wanted us to complain to the management to bring pressure to settle the strike,'' said Jerry Kipnis, a 30-year-old psychiatric resident from Milwaukee.\nOther guests said they had heard dark hints of trouble from the staff.\n''People wanted to check out and go to other hotels, but everything else was fully booked,'' said Christine Ryan, a Manhattan designer of financial software.\nMany people interviewed since the fire reported that the union had predicted trouble on New Year's Eve at the hotel. In fact, radio commercials and handbills paid for by the union gently advised guests and others planning to attend the New Year's Eve ball in the penthouse restaurant on top of the 22-story structure that labor problems at the hotel meant they could not expect to get quality service or entertainment in return for their money that night. There was no menacing tone to the messages, according to those familiar with them.\nWhat was menacing was two earlier fires - one on the evening of Dec. 27 and one the following afternoon - that appeared to have been set. The fire on Dec. 28 was discovered among furniture stored in a ninth-floor room, according to guests, and it disrupted the hotel and prevented many guests from returning to their rooms until later that night.\nThere are conflicting reports as to how far the hotel management pressed for an official effort to track down the arsonists. But the management did hire 30 additional security guards to patrol each floor of the hotel to prevent a repeat of the arson.\nIn that case, was the beach-level floor of the hotel, where the ballroom and adjacent kitchen were located, seen as an area where a smokey fire would go undetected until it had a chance to spread? Convinced of a Plot\nSurviving guests said they were convinced the fire had been plotted by the staff since they observed workers leaving their posts about a half hour before the bombs exploded.\nWhat they apparently saw, and after the fire gave great meaning to, were those staff members leaving the bars and restaurants to attend the union meeting in the ballroom.\nThen there is the question of explosions. Nearly everyone who was in the vicinity of the public ground floors of the hotel and pool patio recalled hearing ''explosions.'' They also said the smell of smoke preceded the explosive sounds by some minutes.\nWhether the fire ignited volatile materials that exploded or created a firestorm of heat that blew out large plate glass widows around the building with explosive force is still being investigated.\nThe authorities say the hotel had been cited in the past by the Commonwealth Environmental Protection Agency for the improper maintenance and storage of fuels used in the building. Union officials said these fuels in past cases had leaked and infiltrated into sewer lines on the grounds of the hotel.

The cause of the fire has not yet been determined and is still under investigation.\nThe 110-page report was prepared by the 54-member commission under the co-chairmanship of Matilda Cuomo, the Governor's wife, and Judith Avner, director of the New York State Division for Women.\nThe report said the bulk of unregulated care appeared to be in family day care homes. Only 10 to 30 percent of such homes are regulated.

In a business world now dominated by computer sophisticates, such persuasion may prove increasingly tough.\nExcept for those corporations that own mainframes, most commercial buyers are now considering the installation of second- and third-generation office computer systems. But for the past year or so, they have been holding off: Buyers today are looking to get more out of the hundreds of thousands of personal computers and minicomputers now in place before they go on another shopping spree. As for those hungry for more power, they want assurances that their new equipment will not prove obsolete as they struggle to install computer-communication networks.\nIf a few years ago the spoils went to computer makers with the most innovative hardware and software, now they seem far more likely to go to companies with the best networking - ''connectivity'' - and related price-performance.\nEnter the International Business Machines Corporation. As industry-watchers are busy with predictions that the company will revamp its line of personal computers to make them more powerful, the product to watch this year is probably I.B.M.'s fledging local-area network. Like many of its competitors, I.B.M. has discovered that it is far more difficult to build seamless networks connecting personal computers to minicomputers and to mainframes than the company ever imagined.\nWhether customers adopt I.B.M.'s solution to the problem could be a key indicator of how difficult the road ahead is for the industry's biggest player. The same problem faces Unisys (the new name for the Sperry-Burroughs combination), which this year must establish that it now has the clout to attract new customers rather than just service old ones.\nWorried as most American computer makers are about 1987, they can take solace in the fact that the Japanese are in just as bad shape. Japan's semiconductor makers are losing tens of millions of dollars each quarter, and it seems unlikely that this will change until the third or fourth quarter. The Japanese are just now starting to focus the bulk of their research and development effort in software, something I.B.M., and to a lesser degree its competitors, have been doing for some time now.\n''We went into this decade worried only about Japan,'' said one I.B.M. executive recently. ''We're leaving it trying to clean up the problems left by our own success.'' HOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987

The merger wave is continuing to roil key industries. Slow, or non-existent, growth and falling prices are forcing some sectors into a new pragmatism.\nIn oil, commercial real estate and agriculture, owners are becoming more willing to sell out at what seem to be fire-sale prices. In entertainment, hard-nosed business executives are cutting costs.\nWith all this, short-term interest rates are likely to dip even further as the Federal Reserve pours money into an economy limping into its fifth expansionary year.\nWhat follows is a look at what could prove to be some of the more interesting sectors by business and economic correspondents of The New York Times.\nWITH the economy facing another sluggish year, short-term interest rates are likely to continue heading downward in 1987 - perhaps dropping another half-percentage point, to around 5 percent during the first six months of 1987. But investor fears that inflation will push up interest rates in the future will keep longer-term interest rates near their current levels of around 7 1/2 percent.\nThe key issue, of course, is the Federal Reserve's perception of how the economy is doing. At this point, despite rising commodity prices, the Fed is compelled to view recession as a bigger threat than inflation. Fresh on the policymakers' minds is the experience in Texas, where energy-industry problems spilled over into real estate and eventually rocked some of the nation's biggest and once-most-profitable banks. With agriculture, real-estate and much heavy industry still under severe pressure, the Fed will give top priority to assuring that the scenario in the Southwest will not be repeated in the overall economy.\nThus, the central bank is much more likely to keep a generous amount of money flowing into the economy than to step on the brakes. And this could mean another cut in the discount rate within the next few months.\nHOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987

He will be in uniform when the Giants (14-2) meet the San Francisco 49ers (10-5-1) at 12:30 P.M. Sunday.\nThe Giants activated Lionel Manuel, their best wide receiver, today a day before their first game of the playoffs. He will be in uniform when the Giants (14-2) meet the San Francisco 49ers (10-5-1) at 12:30 P.M. Sunday.\nManuel sprained his left knee against the New Orleans Saints in the fourth game of the season and spent the remaining 12 games on injured reserve. After his injury, the Giants' passing game suffered until Bobby Johnson, Stacy Robinson and the reacquired Phil McConkey started alternating heroics.\nTo make room for Manuel, the Giants placed John Washington, a rookie defensive end, on injured reserve with back spasms. Washington, a third-round draft choice, had played in all 16 regular-season games, mostly on special teams. Now he is ineligible for the Giants' potential remaining games -the National Conference championship the following Sunday against the Washington Redskins, who upset the Bears in Chicago today, and Super Bowl XXI two weeks after that.\nThe Giants won their last nine games, including a ringing 21-17 victory over the 49ers in San Francisco five weeks ago, en route to the Eastern Division championship. After that loss to the Giants, the 49ers won their last three games en route to the Western Division title.\nThe Giants eliminated the 49ers, 17-3, in a wild-card playoff game a year ago at Giants Stadiuim. But despite their recent success against the 49ers, the Giants are generally favored by only 3 points, and that represents the home-field advantage.\nThe game seems to boil down to which team can stop the other team's imposing weapons - Joe Morris's running for the Giants and Joe Montana's passing for the 49ers. Yet even that is an oversimplification because five weeks ago Montana kept completing passes against the Giants and his team lost and Morris was shut down and his team won.\nIn that game, the 49ers used basically an eight-man front against Morris, and instead of his customary 100-yard game he finished with only 14 yards in 13 carries. One key was the run support by Carlton Williamson, the 49ers' strong safety. That deprived Tim McKyer and Don Griffin, the 49ers' rookie cornerbacks, of support, but the 49ers led at the half, 17-0, and the game seemed over.\n''There was no sense of panic,'' said Phil Simms, the Giants' quarterback. ''We didn't make any adjustments. I remember saying, 'Let's make some plays,' and we did.''\nThe Giants hit one big play after another, including passes against the cornerbacks. The Giants scored three touchdowns in the third quarter and won a game that seemed lost. They won because, said Morris, the 49ers were still worried about his running when the Giants already had decided to pass, not run.\nThe St. Louis Cardinals tried to stop Morris by putting their strong safety, Leonard Smith, close to the line of scrimmage, and Maurice Carthon, the Giants' fullback, spent most of the game knocking Smith out of plays. If the 49ers use Williamson to stop the run, they risk similar treatment and also risk single coverage on Simms's receivers.\nThe Giants' defense, the backbone of the team all season, must contend with Montana's cleverness and mobility. He generally passes from short drops to avoid the rush.\nHe has escaped Lawrence Taylor in the past because a specially designed offensive scheme has John Ayers, a big but quick guard, block the Giants' feared linebacker. But Ayers will probably miss all or most of this game because of a sprained left ankle, and his replacement, Guy McIntyre, is not as adept in pass blocking.\nPRO FOOTBALL
812	IN TRENTON, COMING ELECTIONS COMPLICATE FAMILIAR PROBLEMS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF133BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The New Jersey Legislature will continue to wrestle this year with many of the same problems it faced in 1986 - insurance costs, shore and wetlands protection, transportation financing and municipal aid. But there will be an added complication: all 120 seats in the Senate and the Assembly will be up for election in\nThe New Jersey Legislature will continue to wrestle this year with many of the same problems it faced in 1986 - insurance costs, shore and wetlands protection, transportation financing and municipal aid. But there will be an added complication: all 120 seats in the Senate and the Assembly will be up for election in November.\nLast year was the first time in a dozen years that the two houses were controlled by different parties. The Democrats control the Senate but the Assembly has a Republican majority, a result of Governor Kean's landslide re-election victory in 1985, when only the lower house was on the ballot. From 1973 through 1985, the Democrats controlled both houses.\nWith the divided Legislature, the Senate and Assembly in 1986 failed to agree on most major bills. The two houses did compromise on bills to amend the state's Civil Service system and to give state colleges greater autonomy. Warnings From House Leaders\nThe legislative leaders - Senate President John F. Russo, Democrat of Toms River, and Assembly Speaker Charles L. Hardwick, Republican of Westfield - said in separate interviews that they believed greater cooperation was possible in 1987. But each warned that he was prepared to hold the other house accountable in the upcoming campaign if major issues were not resolved.\nThe first bill passed by the Assembly in 1986 could become one of the first battles of 1987. The measure would change current automobile insurance law to allow suits for pain and suffering only in cases of permanent injury, disfigurement or death.\nThe change, which Governor Kean supports, is intended to lower insurance costs due to pain-and-suffering suits and to reduce premiums paid by motorists. The Senate has rejected the measure and sent its own insurance bill to the Assembly.\nMr. Hardwick predicted the Assembly would amend the Senate bill to match its version and send it back to the Senate, with additional information from the State Insurance Department about the potential cost savings the change could bring. If the Senate refuses to accept the change, it will become part of the coming campaign, he said. 'They Will Lose'\n''We will take the issue to the marketplace of political ideas, and they will lose,'' he said of the Democrats.\nAnother issue that has divided the two houses is how to reduce liability insurance costs. The Republicans and Mr. Kean favor placing limits on court awards that Mr. Russo says will not pass the Senate.\nIn the last year, the Assembly passed three other Kean administration initiatives and sent them to the Senate. A bill to let voters directly change state law or the Constitution through the ballot was kept in committee while the Senate passed its own version, effectively killing it for the time being.\nAnother bill, to create the office of lieutenant governor, was voted down, and a third, to deny bail to defendants who are considered dangerous, is being studied by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Shore Aid to Be Discussed\nThe Governor and the legislative leaders are reportedly ready to meet this month to seek a compromise on financing shore-erosion protection. The Assembly has passed a bill increasing the realty transfer tax to pay for it while the Senate favors a tax on motel and hotel rooms.\nMr. Kean, Mr. Russo and Mr. Hardwick met late last month with a number of mayors to discuss the loss by counties and municipalities of $127 million in Federal revenue-sharing funds. They agreed that something must be done but not on where the money would come from.
813	COMMERCIAL TIMBER LEASING THREATENS OLD FOREST IN OREGON	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DF133BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Residents of Oregon's Willamette Valley are calling it ''the second battle of Bunker Hill,'' but it is really more like Custer's last stand.\nResidents of Oregon's Willamette Valley are calling it ''the second battle of Bunker Hill,'' but it is really more like Custer's last stand.\nAt stake is a section of virgin forest, including trees 200 years or older, on and around Bunker Hill near Marcola, Ore. It is one of the last sections of such venerable forest remaining in a region where the great trees once stood in unbroken ranks for hundreds of miles.\nMany residents of Marcola and other communities in Lane County want to turn the 110-acre forest into a park to preserve its beauty, wildlife, recreational uses and historical and cultural significance.\nBut the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management is selling most of the forest to commercial timber companies. Venerable Trees and Wildlife\nThe small forest is dominated by Douglas firs and hemlocks, some more than 600 years old and rising 200 feet from the forest floor. It also contains maples, dogwood and many other hardwood trees and a rich variety of wildlife, including rare pileated woodpeckers, local residents say.\nThe Lane County Board of Commissioners has applied to the Bureau of Land Management to make the forest a protected park. The county made the application under the Federal Recreation and Public Purposes Act, which permits Federal land agencies to let communities use public land for public purposes.\nBut the local office of the Bureau of the Land Management turned the application down. So did the bureau's regional office. The community is currently appealing the decision with the Interior Department's Board of Land Appeals. But that process may take two years or more, and logging is scheduled to begin Monday on 41 acres of the forest.\nMeanwhile, conservation groups are joining the effort to save the Bunker Hill forest. They say the issue has an importance that extends beyond the stand of trees. They say that at the rate the land bureau and the Agriculture Department's Forest Service are leasing forests for logging, most of the country's ancient forests will be gone in a few years. Threat to Older Forests\n''This is a symbol of what the Federal Government is doing to what is left of our old growth forest,'' said the vice president of the National Audubon Society, Brock Evans. ''Trees like this exist nowhere else in the world but they keeping selling it for logging even though 90 percent of the old growth forest is gone.''\nUnder the public purposes law, the bureau has given local communities the right to use Federal lands for many purposes, including for dumping garbage. But the bureau's manager for the area that includes the forest, Lee Lauritzen, said that though the law permitted local communities to use Federal land for such things as garbage dumps, the land could not be used as a park unless it was a park of ''national interest.'' He said the bureau had determined that the Bunker Hill park would be only of ''local interest.''\nMr. Lauritzen said that the acreage that is to be logged starting Monday was leased before there was any talk of creating a park. He also said that the logging would create jobs and provide some revenue to Federal and local governments.\nHal Hushbeck of Marcola, one of the organizers of the Bunker Hill Old Growth Task Force, a group that is trying to save the forest, said the Rosboro Lumber Company, which leased the section about to be cut, bought the timber when the market was high and would take a substantial loss because of current depressed market conditions. He said the company would be glad to sell back its lease but the land bureau would not agree to the sale.\nA person who answered the telephone at Roseboro said no one was available for comment. Repurchase of Lease Prohibited\nThe chief of forestry in the land bureau's office in Washington, Henry Noldan, said the company could not legally sell the lease back to the Federal Government, nor could the bureau accept it. The policy prevents the bureau from having to buy back leases that buyers would want to return when market conditions became unfavorable.\nIn any case, he said, ''many of us feel there is already enough old growth forest set aside'' for protection. He said 20 percent of commercial forest land had been set aside for other purposes, including protection of old growth.\nBut Mr. Evans of the Audubon Society said the land bureau's plans called for protection of only 2 percent of the forests. ''In 10 to 15 years, there will be no old growth left except for isolated patches,'' he said.\nHe said that until recent years, old-growth forest had been regarded as a kind of ''biological desert'' that supported little wildlife. But new information has shown that it is an indespensible habitat for a wide range of animal and plant life, he said.\nAnother member of the Bunker Hill Task Force, Diane Albino, said she only went into the forest a few times a year for picnics or hikes.\n''But I see it every day driving by and it is just beautiful,'' she said. ''It is a another world in there, a miniature rain forest that is quiet and away from everything. I think the B.L.M. attitude is appalling. They do their planning and listen to what the citizens say about values and livability and then do what they want to do anyway.''

Cutting the Military\nA special plebiscite in November typified both aspects of Mr. Ceausescu's absolute rule. As the Soviet Union raised its military spending by 6 percent, he announced that he was cutting Rumania's armed forces, their equipment and budget by 5 percent.\nThen he ordered a plebiscite to approve his decision. Rumanians reported to their jobs on a Sunday, the only day off from their 46-hour work week, and voted yes unanimously, according to the Government's report. Children from age 14 voted in school, as Mr. Ceausescu lowered the voting age for the occasion.\nBecause they were already at their machines or desks, most were told to put in a regular workday. Of a nation of more than 22 million, with 17.7 million eligible voters, all but 228 people voted and all votes were in favor, the Government said. In the propaganda campaign before the voting, Mr. Ceausescu's image was even more in evidence than usual. His words were inscribed on many walls, and his name dominated the two hours of television a day that are allowed during the power shortage. Plans Fulfilled, Goods Short\nRumanian newspapers do not report on the shortages. A foreign reporter was told at the Ministries of Petroleum Extraction and Food Industry that the ministries had no explanation for the shortages. Both ministries are said to have fulfilled or surpassed their production plans, which provide for the needs of all Rumanians.\nA director at the Food Ministry, Ion Ruianu, denied that there were shortages. He said there might be occasional, brief shortcomings in distribution.\nAsked about the food lines, which begin before dawn and continue into dark in Bucharest and several provincial cities, Mr. Ruianu replied, ''We consider that this is only an appearance, because the statistical data show that the consumption of agricultural and food products increased every year in accordance with the needs of the populations.''\nHe said surplus products were exported only after all domestic needs were met.\nBut a senior Government economist, who spoke anonymously, said that life would continue to be difficult for at least five years and that export production would remain the top priority during that period.\nUnlike other Communist leaders, Mr. Ceausescu has made repayment of the foreign debt, a result of costly and unproductive industrial investment in his early years in power, an overriding goal. Since 1982, he has approximately halved a debt estimated at its peak at $14 billion.\nThe cost of this success has been disregard of basic consumer needs. Meat and dairy products have virtually disappeared from family tables. Asked about the fact that the same people are often seen in line mornings and evenings, Mr. Ruianu said they were hoarding.\nThis brought bitter laughs from consumers. A woman said her family bought at best a couple of pounds of bones, the most frequently available product in the butcher shops. If the family is lucky, she said, the bones were of the better of two categories, with scraps of meat on them. ''The other kind is shiny,'' she said. The average wage is less than 3,000 lei a month. At the official rate, this is $300. The realistic rate is about one-sixth of that, the rate offered by the black-market currency dealers. A Pound of Meat a Month\nIn Cluj, the main city of Transylvania, consumers reported a monthly meat ration of one pound. Gavril Groza, president of the county executive, sidestepped all questions on the availability of food.\nConsumers reported that bread, sugar, cooking oil and flour were rationed, but that the small amounts of the rations were not always available. Cheese and butter had become almost unknown, a woman reported.\nSuch former staples as Rumanian ham, canned meats and cheese are seen only in hard-currency shops for foreigners. A saleswoman said flour, sugar and oil were also occasionally available for foreign currency, which Rumanians are forbidden to have.\nA result is that throughout the cities, foreign students, mainly Arabs and Africans, buy most of the Rumanian products that Rumanians may not buy with the money they earn, then resell them to Rumanians at great profit.\nA working woman with a 9-year-old child said she could feed her family only with the help of her elderly mother, who stands in lines while her daughter is at work. Campaign for More Children\nDespite the food shortages, Rumania is stepping up its longstanding campaign to encourage women to have more children. For years, contraceptives and abortions have been unavailable and illegal. As a result, illegal abortions have caused many deaths. The Government has stepped up obligatory monthly medical checks of women at their workplaces to detect pregnancies and keep them from being interrupted. Diplomats have received reports of implicit encouragement to schoolgirls to produce children out of wedlock.\nAlthough minimal electricity is expended to heat houses and workplaces, no energy is being spared on an ever more grandiose project to devastate the center of the capital and construct a vast avenue with Government palaces and apartment buildings to mark what is officially called ''the Ceausescu Epoch, the Age of Gold.''\nThe only public grumbling heard by a visitor in 15 days came from an old woman bemoaning the vanishing of the old town, with its traditional houses, churches and synagogues. It has earned for Mr. Ceausescu the honorific of ''Hero of Agriculture,'' as one joke has it, ''for plowing up the entire center of Bucharest.''

The Israeli gunboat allowed it to proceed after being told that only crewmen were aboard, they said.\nEarlier, Cyprus asserted that on Friday night, Israel stopped another Junieh-bound ferry, the Sunny Boat, and turned it back to Larnaca after the Cypriot captain refused an Israeli demand that he hand over Palestinian passengers. 'Unacceptable' Action\n''It is entirely unacceptable, and we have already made a strong protest to the Israeli authorities,'' said a Cypriot spokesman, Petros Voskarides. ''The allegation that the ship, which was intercepted in international waters, was carrying Palestinian fighters is arbitrary, to say the least.''\nIn Israel, a military spokesman confirmed that the Sunny Boat had been intercepted but said it was allowed to continue its journey. [ Foreign Minister Shimon Peres denied that Israel was blockading Junieh, The Associated Press reported from Tel Aviv. But Mr. Peres added, ''Every time we have information about the movement of guerrillas or weapons which could pose a threat, we take preventive measures.'' ] The Israeli state radio said the captain of the gunboat first asked the Sunny Boat's captain to hand over Palestinian passengers and, when he refused, ordered the ship back to Cyprus.\nThe captain of the Sunny Boat, Dimitris Vrakas, said the captain of the Israeli gunboat had told him by radio, ''You and the other ship do not follow our instructions and you continue to bring Palestinian terrorists back to Lebanon.''\nIsrael has stated on several occasions in the past that its navy will take whatever action it sees fit to prevent guerrilla attacks and insure the country's security.\nIn Beirut today, President Amin Gemayel asked the United States Ambassador, John Kelly, for Washington's support to insure that Israel stopped interfering with the ferry service, official sources said. A Daily Shuttle\nThe Sunny Boat and the Empress run a daily 14-hour shuttle between Larnaca and Junieh, in Christian-held territory north of Beirut.\nThe route is vital for Lebanese Christians and Westerners fearful of passing through Moslem-controlled West Beirut to reach the international airport just south of the city.

It also recommends that judicial review be required of all surrogate contracts.\nThe recommendations, which are expected to form the basis of a bill to be introduced in the upcoming legislative session, represent an initial victory for proponents of surrogate motherhood.\nThe recommendations are likely to spark an emotional controversy. Several religious groups, including most recently a group of New Jersey bishops, have condemned surrogate motherhood as a sophisticated form of adultery, and many feminists have decried the renunciation of a mother's rights that the arrangement entails.\nOpponents of surrogate motherhood, which generally involves a payment to the mother, have deemed the practice baby selling and hence illegal.\nThe hazy legality of surrogate motherhood under current law has been dramatized by the Baby M. case in New Jersey. In that case, which is to go to trial tomorrow, the surrogate mother, Mary Beth Whitehead, is fighting to keep the child she conceived through artificial insemination and had agreed to relinquish to its father, William Stern.

It will be observed with special pageantry among Spanish-speaking people who hold the feast as one of the most important religious holidays.\nThe feast of the Epiphany, marking the visit of the three kings to the birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem, will be observed today at services in churches throughout the metropolitan area. It will be observed with special pageantry among Spanish-speaking people who hold the feast as one of the most important religious holidays.\nIn Spanish-speaking communities, the holiday is called the Fiesta de los Tres Reyes, the Feast of the Three Kings. It will be marked in many churches with children dressed as the three kings offering gifts to the Christ child and with festive community lunches and gift-giving to children.\nA curator of Museo del Barrio in Manhattan, Rafael Morales, said that in Spanish-speaking countries gifts are given at the feast and not at Christmas.\nOn Tuesday, beginning at 10 A.M., the museum at 1230 Fifth Avenue near 104th Street will sponsor its annual children's costume procession, complete with camels and other animals, through the streets of Spanish Harlem. Visit Re-enacted\n''January 6 is the official feast day in Spain and Latin America,'' said the pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe at 229 West 14th Street in Manhattan, the Rev. Francisco Dominguez. ''But here in the United States it is observed on the closest Sunday to the feast so that more people can go to church.''\nYesterday at the church, 15 children, dressed in costumes re-enacted the visit of the three kings in a play. Today, during the 11 A.M. mass, children will bring their offerings to children dressed as Jesus, Mary and Joseph.\nIn the Bronx, at Immaculate Conception Church, which has mostly Italian and Hispanic parishioners, the Spanish Society will hold a community party and luncheon after the 10:30 A.M. mass at which children will receive gifts. The church is at 754 East Gun Hill Road.\nThe most spectacular observance will be the two-hour procession, now in its 10th year, at Museo del Barrio. Seven hundred to 1,000 costumed children are expected to participate.

There was no additional purchase price, he said.\nAlthough Emigrant, like other savings banks, lost large amounts of money in the early 1980's because of high interest rates and limits on what it could charge for loans, the bank was profitable of late. It earned about $26 million in the first 11 months of 1986. Still, according to Mr. Halvorsen, selling the bank was difficult.\nThe sale of Emigrant follows by less than two weeks the sale of another major New York savings bank. The Williamsburgh Savings Bank was sold to the Republic National Bank of New York for about $85 million.\nIn recent years, several troubled savings banks have been sold to private investors. These have included the Bowery Savings Bank and the East River Savings Bank.\nAlthough it is unusual for a savings institution to be sold to real-estate developers, it has happened before. State and Federal banking laws are aimed at preventing conflicts of interest in these cases.\nEmigrant was founded in the 1850's to provide loans to Irish immigrants.

The vicissitudes of his involvement were so great that, were he a subject on a couch, he would be diagnosed as having a dual personality, if not triple and quadruple.\nIt was the longest fourth quarter for Russell Carter, the Jets' third-year cornerback and one-time psychology major out of Southern Methodist. The vicissitudes of his involvement were so great that, were he a subject on a couch, he would be diagnosed as having a dual personality, if not triple and quadruple.\nHe is nine credits short of a degree, and, he said, one lesson that has stayed with him from his school days in the head courses is ''never get down on yourself.''\nHe might have had reason to today, when he seemed to have aided and abetted the opposition mightily.\nThe Jets, on this cold afternoon with a wintry breeze wafting in from Lake Erie beside Cleveland Stadium, were ahead by 13-10 early in the fourth quarter, but the Browns, behind Bernie Kosar, were moving downfield with purpose.\nOn third down and 6 yards to go on the Jets' 14, Kosar threw a sideline pass to Webster Slaughter who, just as he was about to catch the ball, received a push from Carter, according to the referee.\n''I just thought it was a bad call,'' Carter would later say. Never mind. It was first down for the Browns, and only 10 yards from the goal line.\nAfter two running plays by Kevin Mack brought the Browns to the 2, Kosar tried another pass to win the game. Interception Ends Threat\nHe threw it to Slaughter, again, or thought he did. In fact, he threw it to Carter, who intercepted the ball in the end zone.\nThere was no return. Nine minutes remained and the Jets would score again to make it 20-10 in their favor. They were, well, if not home free, then certainly on the right road.\nKosar had been intercepted only 10 times in more than 500 passing attempts all season, the lowest interception ratio of any quarterback in the National Football League, and this was the first time after 133 passes in which he had not been picked off.\n''Kosar gets rid of the ball fast,'' said Carter, ''and the defensive line doesn't give pressure enough to get to him.''\nBut, Carter said, ''You can only hold a great team so long.''\nAnd then the Browns were coming back. They scored one touchdown, and it was 20-17, and then they were threatening to score again. With no timeouts left and 51 seconds to go, Kosar threw to Slaughter, who made a leaping catch at the Jets' 5. The defender was Carter. 'A Great Catch'\n''It was a great catch,'' he said. ''I was all over him. I couldn't have been closer to him.''\nOn the next play, Kosar again went to Slaughter in the end zone. The closest defender to Slaughter was that old psych major from S.M.U. The game, and the ball, hung in the balance.\n''I didn't see the ball, I was just following the receiver,'' said Carter. And suddenly he felt the ball hit his hand. ''I sideswiped the ball. I didn't have time to get two hands on the ball.''\nIt was enough to prevent the touchdown. But Carter, in the heat of the moment, fell to his knees and hung his head in frustration at not having made an interception that surely would have concluded the game. ''It was close,'' he said later. It gave the Browns one more chance, and Mark Moseley kicked a 22-yard field goal to tie the game.\nOne overtime and some change later, Moseley kicked another to finish off the Jets.\nAfterward, Carter walked off the field and was met by some old friends of his on the Browns, Rickey Bolden, Gerald McNeil and Felix Wright.\n''Rickey and I were teammates at S.M.U., and we both live in Dallas,'' said Carter. ''He's getting married in the offseason and asked if I was going to be in Dallas. I said I was.''\nWas anything other than home discussed - like the game?\n''Well, we just said, 'Nice game, nice game,' '' said Carter. ''We knew who won and lost. What else was there to say?''

''It would be a miracle if he were alive.'' The Dellisantys are from Newark. The Experts at Work\nAt the hospital, a team of more than 40 pathologists, including eight members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from Washington, have been trying to identify 95 bodies, using dental records, descriptions of jewelry and other information.\nSince the disaster, 21 victims have been identified at the center, said Dr. Luis Izquierdo Mora, the Secretary of Health of Puerto Rico. ''Most are not recognizable,'' Dr. Izquierdo Mora said. ''That's what takes time. It's impossible to say how long all this will take.''\nMr. Dellisanty and his mother flew to San Juan on New Year's Day and have been waiting for news since then. Clutching a local newspaper, Mr. Dellisanty pointed to a name on a list of victims, Frank Dellisanty. It was his father's name, but his father had died last month in New Jersey.\n''This is too much of a coincidence,'' Mr. Dellisanty said. ''We figure he was carrying some pay stubs of my father and they misidentified him.' Many Records Out of Reach\nNearby, a Red Cross worker handed forms to waiting relatives and asked for descriptions of anything the relatives could think of that would help. Many of the families could not get essential records because it was a weekend and they could not reach their dentists and doctors.\nSeveral Roman Catholic priests and Protestant ministers circulated among the families attempting to console them, offering prayers. Or they just listened to the venting of feelings, which ranged from anger and denial to acceptance.\n''One family wants to know if they can take the body directly to the funeral home once it is identified,'' a medical worker asked Dr. Efren Ramirez, a supervising doctor. Victims' Names Grow on Chart\nAfter checking his list for the name of the missing person, Dr. Ramirez said: ''Yes, but unfortunately the name is not on the list of the people we have identified. I'm sorry they have to wait a while longer.''\nThe medical team lifted fingerprints from the covered bodies while other doctors and forensic experts examined dental records. Names of victims were added to a chart on the wall as victims were identified.\nAfter the body of a woman from Queens was identified, the family was called into another room, where a psychiatrist, a nurse and a priest were on hand. The doctor talked in a hushed tone. The family members hugged each other and wept.\nMeanwhile, Sara Rodriguez of Westport, Conn., waited for news of her cousin, a lawyer and businesswoman in San Juan.\nThe body was identified at the hotel after the fire, and preparations were being made for a funeral, but the family did not know where the body was until today. ''I am more calm now that we found out where she was taken,'' Mrs. Rodriguez said. ''She was a teacher, lawyer, and friend, very humble and very loyal.''\nAt the burn center at Rio Piedras, a Catholic priest, Florentino Saenz, said that a team of Catholic priests and Protestant pastors have been available since the disaster to relatives of the victims.\n''We are here to provide a basic human support for a tragic accident,'' he said. ---- The Waiting at Home In the New York metropolitan area, families anxiously awaited word yesterday. EaA woman who identified herself as the sister of William Craine, a 21-year-old Queens resident reported missing in San Juan, answered the phone at the Craine home in Howard Beach.\nShe broke down and wept when she was asked if she had any news on the whereabouts of her brother or her grandmother, who was traveling with him. ''My father went there yesterday to see what he can find out,'' said the woman. ''but we didn't get any more information.''\nReferring to her brother, she said, ''Him and my grandmother are still missing.'' To the Island on a Cruise\nShe said they had gone to Puerto Rico on ''a cruise with an aunt and uncle and five or six cousins,'' adding that most of her relatives were on the beach when the fire broke out.\nA compilation of victims of the fire released later in the day by The Associated Press listed a William Crane, 31, of Howard Beach, among the dead. #33 on an Excursion In Connecticut, friends and relatives of seven people missing in Puerto Rico turned their attention to gathering dental records yesterday.\nThe missing Connecticut residents were from a group of 33 on a New Year's excursion to the Caribbean. It was the sixth such trip they had made in six years.\n''Seven of our friends are missing -it's a death watch,'' said John Benevento, of Woodbridge, who escaped the fire by smashing a chair through a window and jumping to a patio.\nAmong those unaccounted for, according to friends, relatives, and news reports, were Robert Melillo of Cheshire, Susan Lawrence of Shelton, Linda Borkowski of Beacon Falls, Jerry Mendell of Easton, Joseph Gully of Stratford, Alvin Cohen, 56, of Hamden, and Joel V. Katz, 50, of Trumbull.

Poage, who represented central Texas's 11th Congressional District in for 42 years until retiring in 1978, died yesterday of heart failure after emergency surgery at Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple, Tex. He was 87 years old and a resident and native of Waco.\nW. R. Poage, who represented central Texas's 11th Congressional District in for 42 years until retiring in 1978, died yesterday of heart failure after emergency surgery at Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple, Tex. He was 87 years old and a resident and native of Waco.\nRepresentative Poage, a Democrat, was first elected to Congress in 1936 after working a farm, practicing law and spending 12 years in the State Legislature in Austin. In Washington, he sat on the House Agriculture Committee for 34 years, serving as its chairman from 1967 until a new generation of Democrats in the House openly rebelled against its rigid seniority system toward the end of 1974.\nAs a junior member of the Agriculture Committee, Mr. Poage had championed the small farmer. He railed against the farm policies of the Eisenhower Administration, which he held responsible for forcing farmers off the land instead of insuring their prosperity. Forced to Make Compromises\nBut the power of rural interests in Congress was in a long, historic decline that coincided with his tenure. His own political influence, derived from incumbency and his Southern power base, waned with the farm bloc and, even as he held the chairmanship, he was forced to make compromises with urban Democrats.\nMr. Poage had looked askance at Federal food stamps and sought to restrict their use. He also was skeptical of various other proposals to give food assistance to the poor and, as late as 1968, disputed the presence of hunger in the rural South.\nTo preserve his influence, he became more open to arguments from differing farming interests and even courted urban liberals by supporting a more generous approach to food stamps so as to win passage of a farm bill he could live with in 1973.\nThe revolt that gathered force the following year was fueled by first-term Democrats elected in the wake of the Watergate scandals. Their first target became Wilbur D. Mills of the Ways and Means Committee, perhaps the most powerful chairman of them all, who resigned under fire in December.\nBy then, Mr. Poage's role as the defender of the small farmer had become overshadowed by his defense of strict sugar quotas and subsidies to corporate cotton growers.\nIn a stunning upset, in January 1975, Mr. Poage was deposed from his committee chairmanship along with two other long-term Southern strongmen: Wright Patman, a fellow Texan, from the Banking and Currency Committee, and F. Edward Hebert of Louisiana, from the Armed Services Committee. Had Surgery in 1977\nMr. Poage, who continued as deputy chairman of the Agriculture Committee, underwent an operation in 1977, then announced that he would not run for another term. At the time he was the second-ranking House member in seniority.\nAfter his return to Waco, he pursued a lifelong avocation by writing books on the history of central Texas and McLennan County and the recollections of his boyhood.\nHe worked largely out of the W. R. Poage Legislative Library Center at Baylor University, his alma mater. The center for advanced studies and research was built with private funds and formed another of his principal interests.\nA nursing supervisor at the Waco hospital said yesterday that Mr. Poage had suffered a heart attack Dec. 10 while driving in Waco. His car mounted a divider and struck a tree.\nMr. Poage was hospitalized until Dec. 20, was readmitted last Monday for intensive tests and underwent the emergency surgery Friday, the supervisor, Betty White, said. Spent His Youth on a Cow Ranch\nWilliam Robert (Bob) Poage was born Dec. 28, 1899, in Waco but spent part of his early youth on a cow ranch the family ran in western Texas. He attended Waco High School and served a year in the Navy as an apprentice seaman in 1918 before enroling at Baylor University, where he honed his oratory as a member of the debating team.\nHe graduated in 1921 and worked as an undergraduate instructor in geology while earning his law degree at the Baylor law school. He was admitted to the Texas bar in 1924 and practiced in Waco until 1935.\nMr. Poage served four years in the Texas House of Representatives, 1924-28, and in the state Senate from 1930 until his election to Congress.\nA widower, he is survived by a brother, Scott A. Poage of Waco; a nephew, Scott T. Poage, also of Waco, and a niece, April Poage Woolsey of Austin.\nA funeral service is to be held at 2:30 P.M. tomorrow at the First Presbyterian Church in Waco.\nEX CONGRESSMAN W.R. POAGE, 87

Liberty Baptist College is about to play Boston College in the Honda/Mitsubishi/ Suntory Sayonara Bowl in Tokyo. The winner will receive $10 million and the loser $5 million, just like a heavyweight fight. Don King is the promoter, of course.\nMARCH of 1997. Liberty Baptist College is about to play Boston College in the Honda/Mitsubishi/ Suntory Sayonara Bowl in Tokyo. The winner will receive $10 million and the loser $5 million, just like a heavyweight fight. Don King is the promoter, of course.\nLiberty Baptist and Boston College are the only undefeated teams in the land because Michigan has lost in the Rose Bowl for the 83d straight year and Southern Methodist, in its first year back from a long suspension, has lost in the Cotton Bowl.\nAt halftime of the Sayonara Bowl, the amiable color man, Brian Bosworth, interviews the new President of the United States. Wearing his legendary ''rose-colored'' dark glasses, President Joe Paterno pronounces: ''Let me make it perfectly clear. The winner of this game will be national champion.''\nWhat's so bad with this picture? What's wrong with the annual survival-of-the-fittest, money-talks, freebooting system of bowl games determining an unofficial champion?\nJoe Paterno would like to change the bowl system, and when Paterno talks, it is worth listening. He has just won his second championship with Penn State's 14-10 victory over Miami in the Fiesta Bowl Friday night.\nThis game was obviously for the national title because the Fiesta Bowl hustlers - looking like a platoon of award-winning real estate agents in their citrus jackets - were able to cut a deal with NBC and Penn State and Miami and put a game on prime time on Jan. 2, after all the other bowls had gone to sleep.\nThe game must have been a huge success for the television people, because a series of winter storms kept people huddled in front of the tube near midnight in the East, as the Heisman Trophy winner, Vinny Testaverde, moved his team down the field before being intercepted.\nReasonably fresh from a few hours' sleep, Paterno came to the morning-after conference yesterday and put in his annual plug for a national playoff system.\n''I can't believe that after 75 million or 85 million or whatever, that this wasn't a great showcase for college football,'' Paterno said. ''Kids trying to win it. That's what it's all about.''\nPaterno praised the idea of the top-rated and second-rated teams playing for the title, saying, ''When you're a competitor, you want to beat the other team. Poise and determination in the clutch.''\nPardon the coach if he sounds like a crusader. He thinks his teams of 1968, 1969 and 1973 were jobbed out of consideration for the national title because there was no way to prove themselves.\nIn the 1969 season, his team beat Missouri in the Orange Bowl, 10-3, to finish with an 11-0 record but was outpointed by undefeated Texas in the balloting by coaches and football writers.\nPaterno has always blamed one fan, a certain Richard M. Nixon, then employed as a public servant in Washington. Mr. Nixon had attended the Texas-Arkansas game during the regular season and had declared on national television that the winner of that game would be champ for the year.\n''I don't understand how Richard Nixon could know so much about college football in 1969 and so little about Watergate in 1973,'' Paterno told the Penn State graduates in June 1973.\nNow Paterno has won two unofficial titles, getting his second chance because Penn State and Miami both play a nonconference schedule and were available for the Fiesta Bowl's blatant tropism toward prime time.\nThe promoters here are talking up designating a different major bowl each year to decide the national title, of having an impartial panel (including, one assumes, Mr. Nixon, who is more than available for such tasks) choose the two candidates.\nPaterno, deservedly the Mr. Clean of college coaches, went even further yesterday. He said he didn't want to interfere with the bowls, and would prefer ''four teams coming out of the bowls, playing semifinals and finals, spreading it around, a couple more weeks of college football, it's exciting.''\nNo coach is more entitled to this grandiose vision than Paterno, a voice of conscience and humor and rationality for his 21 seasons. But as the wise old men used to say, whittling on the front steps of the general store back home in the picturesque hollows of central Queens, ''If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''\nWhat's wrong with a system that mixes anarchy with conference loyalties, cold hard cash with the magic wand of Presidential intercession, the ingenuity of network magnates bumping up against the polls of coaches and football writers?\nI know I've said this before, but I like the suspense every fall of seeing who will ante up the most bucks to lure scholar-athletes to some warm spot on the map. I like descending hordes of bowl officials, with their exotic accents, calling everybody ''Hoss'' and ''Buddy'' and ''Son,'' wearing those bright coats like a technicolor television test pattern.\nThis is America. Lee Iacocca told me so. Freedom of choice: You believe what you want, I believe what I want, you buy a Volkswagen, I buy a Nissan, better dead than Red.\nI'm not sure that the prospect of a sterile, official, pasteurized, homogenized National Collegiate Athletic Association championship playoff isn't some plot straight from the Kremlin. I've been to Russia - one brand of toothpaste, one brand of coffee, one political party. Is this what we want in the land of opportunity?\nNo, suh, buddy, I'm waiting till next fall to watch the Fiesta Bowl try to fend off some other new bowl on the block, its promoters wearing day-glo jackets and promising to play in prime time in Death Valley.\nThe conferences may not survive this gold rush, but isn't it time we broke them up, the way they broke up the telephone company? I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of a telephone official since, but, hey, free enterprise, it's only patriotic.\nSPORTS OF THE TIMES

Eliot Stanley, president of the 45-member Baxter Society, a statewide bibliophiles club, said, ''Any book collector has had bad dreams that could be realized in this drawing.'' But some customers who admit only a casual attachment to books are horrified by it.\n''It's a frightening figure,'' said Clark Neily, head of the city's Department of Economic Development. ''But then I'm not a book collector.'' Indeed, said David Turner, co-owner of the shop with Norma Carlson, perhaps only those who ''know the demon'' can appreciate such possessive rage, finding in it a reflection of the ''lust for books'' that plagues serious collectors.\nNo one knows the demon better, Mr. Turner said, than Bradford Hale.\nFor 23 years the 68-year-old Mr. Hale has kept a library of 3,000 books on the military and naval history of Europe locked in a warehouse in Portland. The collection is too large for his single room in a downtown boarding house, and Mr. Hill said he has been on a waiting list for public housing for two-and-a-half years.\nHe became angry at the suggestion he sell his library, valued at about $50,000, and buy himself a home.\n''You've committed heresy,'' he cried. ''The point is not a comfortable place for me to live. The point is a place for me to live where my books would be comfortable.''\nWhen asked to explain the obsession, Mr. Hale answered, ''Can you explain love?'' But Mr. Turner, busy sliding calendars into mailing envelopes, said, ''The demon.'' Memorial Signs On Delaware Road A highway sign installed last week alongside a county road in rural Sussex County, Delaware, states simply, ''D.U.I. killed 1 here.''\nBut to Bertram and Peggy Abrahart of Angola, the tombstone-shaped marker is a memorial to their 14-year-old daughter, Suzanne, who was killed near the spot by a driver under the influence of alcohol in 1976.\nSimilar signs may soon be seen all over Delaware under a program sponsored by the State Office of Highway Safety and Mothers Against Drunk Drivers.\n''We see it as an opportunity to combine a memorial and a message,'' said Marcene Gory of the state highway office.\nThe reflective signs, designed and installed by the State Division of Highways, are being offered free of charge to relatives of victims of drunken drivers. Safety officials also hope the effort will resolve another traffic problem, caused by people placing their own memorials at accident scenes.\nAn unauthorized sign erected to mark the site of a death near I-95 in Wilmington was knocked down in a matter of hours - by another drunken driver.\nThree crosses erected to mark the scene of three deaths near Dover Air Force Base have caused a major hazard as motorists either slow down or pull off the busy highway to investigate them, Ms. Gory said.\nDrunken drivers were blamed for more than 60 percent of the highway fatalities in Delaware in 1986. Sporting Problem For Boston Mayor BOSTON'S athletic teams have scored major victories this year, but one of the city's major sports fans is displeased with the way that some games are being played.\nMayor Raymond L. Flynn is distressed by what he sees as ''senseless violence'' among athletes in games. He has written letters to the managements of the city's professional teams asking them to curb violence among players and threatening, as a last recourse, to have heedless players arrested for assault.\nThe Mayor's first voiced his concern after a hockey game Nov. 19 in which brawls overshadowed the Montreal Canadiens' victory over the Boston Bruins. After that game, Mr. Flynn spoke to the parents of children who play hockey, who were upset with the example set by the professional athletes.\n''When a mayor is talking about setting a tone for his or her city on issues like staying in school or encouraging young people to avoid drugs, he can't at the same time look the other way from the occurrence of wanton violence in the athletic arena,'' said Francis J. Costello, the Mayor's press secretary. ''We don't allow violence in a movie theater, public street or public building. A sports arena is no different.''\nSamuel Gifford, vice president of the Delaware North Companies, the hockey team's parent organization, said that the Bruins management was puzzled by the Mayor's letter. ''You don't get things like this all the time,'' he said, ''We're going to seek guidance from the National Hockey League on this one.''\nMany Boston fans were skeptical of the Mayor's campaign against sports violence, and say that it is unenforceable. One longtime Bruins fan said, ''I just can't see the Boston police risking breaking a leg on the ice to interrupt a hockey game.''
833	RACE TO BUILD MALL STIRS CONCERNS IN BERSHIRE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D8133BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The pace of development in Berkshire County has been dramatically accelerated by a heated competition to build the first regional shopping mall in this predominantly rural county on the western edge of Massachusetts.\nThe pace of development in Berkshire County has been dramatically accelerated by a heated competition to build the first regional shopping mall in this predominantly rural county on the western edge of Massachusetts.\nLast autumn three national developers unveiled rival plans for malls at different sites in central Berkshire County. The situation has become a race among the developers, since it is generally acknowledged that the local population of 150,000 people is enough to support only one regional mall.\nIn mid-October the Pyramid Companies of Syracuse, N.Y., quietly obtained a local building permit for a 500,000-square-foot mall in the small town of Lanesboro. About the same time a partnership between Melvin Simon & Associates of Indianapolis and Simon Konover & Associates of West Hartford, Conn., announced plans to build a mall at a busy intersection in the larger city of Pittsfield.\nMeanwhile, the Shopco Group of New York City unveiled a proposal for another mall in the southern end of Pittsfield along Route 7. Confusion Among Residents\nThis sudden burst of activity has provoked confusion and controversy in Berkshire County, which is struggling to balance preservation of its scenic beauty and casual pace with the need to broaden the county's economic base. Many residents and officials are in favor of a mall here, but the chaotic circumstances have also dismayed many people, including mall supporters.\n''This happened so fast that everyone was immediately forced to be either for or against the mall on an emotional basis with no chance to really think about what it will mean for the community's future,'' said Mindy Guidi, a neighbor of the Lanesboro mall site, where Pyramid started preliminary construction just two weeks after officially announcing their project.\nCompounding the confusion is the parallel competition between officials in Pittsfield and Lanesboro, which would each prefer to see the mall situated within its own borders to broaden the local tax base. This has caused friction between the two governments and prompted official drives within each community to accelerate the approval process for the malls. Tourism Creates Affluence\nThe development race comes at a time when Berkshire County's economy has become increasingly divided. The county's economic mainstays have steadily declined as local manufacturing plants have cut back operations or disappeared altogether.\nAt the same time, Berkshire County's cultural activities, including the Tanglewood summer music program, its skiing and its scenery have given it an appeal to tourists and affluent seasonal vacationers that has mushroomed, spurring a boom in real estate, construction, retailing and other service industries. This is also changing the county's landscape, as new developments spread out over the countryside.\nThis change has placed middle-class residents in a difficult predicament. Employment trends are shifting to lower-paying service jobs, while the cost of living is rising as real estate and other local markets become increasingly oriented to affluent outside buyers.\nThis has spurred countywide efforts to encourage new growth here, like a mall. While that basic goal is widely shared, opinions on the most appropriate strategies vary widely. Call for Control\nMany people warn that unless the county makes an assertive and coordinated effort to control growth now, it will quickly succumb to the severe problems like congestion and pollution that often accompany runaway development. Critics are dismayed by the mall situation, which they see as an ominous indication of a lack of ability and willingness to make this effort.\n''The communities involved in this race don't seem to want to step back and look at its implications,'' said George S. Wislocki, director of the Berkshire Natural Resources Council, an environmental advocacy organization. ''Instead, they're willing to give away the store to win the competition for the mall. That attitude is not going to be healthy for the county in the long run.''\nBut the mall competition is perceived more optimistically by others who see it as a reflection of vitality and progress. Proponents also defend the support of local officials toward the mall developers and contend that reasonable environmental considerations will not be disregarded.\n''Right now, the county can't afford to take an adversarial role with these project,'' contends James W. Wallace, president and chief executive officer of the Central Berkshire Chamber of Commerce. ''It would send out a strong signal that the county is anti-growth. Instead we should be grateful that these developers are willing to make an investment of that magnitude here, and support them.''\nDespite the rapid pace of events, it will probably be some time before the outcome of the race is determined. The fate of each mall proposal will depend on many different factors, including the decisions of the department stores that the developers are trying to lure as major tenants and the results of the state and local environmental review processes.
834	ON VERGE OF A CLEANUP, BOSTON TAKES CLOSE LOOK AT HARBOR, SLUDGE AND ALL	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D8133BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: This metropolitan area of three million people is on the threshold of a protracted and costly effort to return its polluted harbor to a healthy state, something no one now living has ever seen.\nThis metropolitan area of three million people is on the threshold of a protracted and costly effort to return its polluted harbor to a healthy state, something no one now living has ever seen.\nTo show the public what this means, the New England Aquarium is mounting an unusual exhibit of Boston Harbor's past, present and what many hope will be its cleaner future.\nAt the center of the exhibit will be a tank diplaying the dismal state of the harbor, which is among the most polluted major harbors in the country. The condition of the harbor is so bad that a Federal court has ordered a cleanup effort that will stretch at least until the end of the century and cost about $2 billion.\nThe exhibit, designed to educate the aquarium's one million visitors each year, will include ''obnoxious blue-green algal mats,'' according to Leslie S. Kaufman, a research scientist who is the aquarium's Curator of Education. The mats, which are bacterial and not a true algae, flourish in the harbor ''because it's the only thing that can prosper in that environment,'' he said. Sores and Diseased Livers\nThere will probably also be some pseudopleuronectes americanus, known variously as winter flounder, blackback flounder and gray sole, a popular game fish that thrives on the organic matter found in sewage, although the larger, older specimens typically have cancerous sores on the body and fins and a diseased liver.\nThe predilections of the flounder are easy to see, according to Dr. Kaufman. He has been out in the harbor at low tide in the summer to take water samples near a crack in an outflow pipe, where raw sewage from a wide crescent surrounding Boston forms a geyser.\n''You can find it by looking for the fishing boats,'' he said.\nA second tank will show smelt, salmon, striped bass, river herring and other species believed to have been present in better times. Some species were driven off by pollution, some by loss of spawning grounds and some by both, he said.\nThe aquarium already has a small display dedicated to local waters. A tank representing the Charles River Basin includes a liberal sprinkling of beer cans and a rusting shopping cart, which leads officials of the aquarium to note that while some of the human contributions to the harbor and nearby waters are esthetically unappealing, they are not chemically dangerous. Knowledge of Sewage\nAt the entrance to the new exhibit, scheduled to open in March, visitors will confront a computerized survey in which they will be asked questions like ''Do you know where it goes when you flush the toilet?'' For about two million people, the correct answer is Boston Harbor, often without stopping at a treatment plant.\nOther questions include: ''Would you swim in the harbor? Would you fish in the harbor?'' Sport fishing, in fact, is popular in the harbor, and the harbor has many beaches, although health officials sometimes close them.\nA map nearby will trace the scores of sewage pipes emptying in the harbor, the bathing beaches and the fishing spots.\nThe treatment is a trifle blunt for the 17-year-old aquarium, which is dominated by more conventional exhibits like a giant pool of frolicking penguins, tanks filled with the exotic denizens of Pacific and Caribbean coral reefs, and dolphin and sea lion shows. The thought of a harbor exhibit at the aquarium, said Steven S. Lenox, the curator of exhibits, probably conjures up visions of the Boston Tea Party, clipper ships, and historic wharf architecture.\nBut Massachusetts has established itself as particularly adept at turning its back on the harbor that for years was the reason for its growth. Through the 1960's and 1970's Boston and neighboring communities largely ignored the mandates from Washington to clean up the harbor, and the region is being dragged into compliance now only because of a suit successfully brought by the City of Quincy, which shares the harbor, and by environmentalist groups.\nThe work will include a major new sewage treatment facility, and the sludge it produces will be dumped far from the harbor, although where is not clear now. Progress to Be Monitored\nThe aquarium, joined by the Massachusetts Audubon Society, Northeastern University and several environmental groups, is also planning a harbor monitoring project, to chart the improvements brought by new sewage treatment facilities, and to convince the public that the effort that will result in sharply higher water and sewer rates is producing results.\n''With a concerted effort, we can clean it up over 15 to 25 years,'' Dr. Kaufman said. ''That's short enough for people to see some progress.''\nMonthly tests of the water will begin in the spring, and results indicating the health of plant and animal life in the water and the effectiveness of sewage treatment will be issued.\nWhile environmentalists have high hopes for the water quality in the first decade of the next century, some parts of the harbor will not be cleaned, notably the sediments, some of which are now legally classified as hazardous wastes.\n''A lot of this stuff can never be cleaned up,'' Dr. Kaufman said. ''Once it's in place, we're better off locking the door and walking away quietly.''\nThe aquarium is also working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop a computerized model of the mixing action of tides in the harbor. The model will allow aquarium visitors to place sewage pipes in different places in the harbor.\n''People from one neighborhood will put it in another neighborhood,'' he said. ''The kick is, no matter where you put it, it stays where you put it. It goes back and forth and back and forth.'' The logic of the existing sewage system was that the tides would flush out the harbor, he said, but the actual effect is more a mixing than a flushing.
835	WASHINGTON TALK: Q&A: William Bradford Reynolds; Perception and Reality on Civil Rights	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D8133BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: In the aftermath of the racial attack in the Howard Beach section of Queens and because of what many civil rights leaders view as a growing pattern of racially motivated violence around the country, the Department of Justice has found itself accused of failing to enforce the civil rights laws.\nIn the aftermath of the racial attack in the Howard Beach section of Queens and because of what many civil rights leaders view as a growing pattern of racially motivated violence around the country, the Department of Justice has found itself accused of failing to enforce the civil rights laws.\nAt the center of such attacks is William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the civil rights division, a Reagan appointee whose promotion to Associate Attorney General was rejected by the Senate because of complaints about his record on civil rights enforcement.\nFollowing are excerpts from an interview with Mr. Reynolds in his office here this week:\nQ. Some critics have said that under this Justice Department, civil rights enforcement has virtually come to a standstill in housing and employment discrimination, as well as other areas. How do you respond to such criticism?\nA. Those critics clearly haven't looked at the record. The civil rights enforcement activity in the last year has been greater and more vigorous than it has ever been in the history of the civil rights division. And that's whether you measure it in terms of cases brought, investigations initiated, the kind of relief we are obtaining or numbers of people who are beneficiaries of that relief. The critics shy away from any kind of confrontation with the record or looking at the record, and in very general, broad-based rhetoric, level a charge that has absolutely no basis at all.\nQ. When you talk about the record, could you be a little more specific?\nA. We have more criminal prosecutions than ever before, and our success rate is up in the 80 percent level, which is the highest it has ever been. In the Voting Rights Acts enforcement area, we are obtaining more relief that is to the advantage of minorities in this country and their ability to exercise the franchise than you have had at any time in the history of the division. In the employment area, the kinds of cases we are bringing and kind of remedy we are getting, exceeds quite significantly anything that has been gotten by the division anytime in the past. The same is true with housing; we're actually getting to the bottom of housing discrimination.\nQ. What is the difference in Ku Klux Klan activity now, compared with six or seven years ago? A. We've had major victories in criminal prosecutions against the Klan. We have significantly interfered with, defeated and brought to an end a large measure of Klan activity. That's not to say that we've eliminated the Klan yet in all places where it exists, but it is fair to say we've broken the back of the Klan in terms of any major nucleus of activity.\nQ. But there is a perception that the division is not actively enforcing civil rights laws. Why is that?\nA. The perception's there because the political rhetoric controls the attitudes that you have. The man on the street knows what we are doing only to the extent that you get any honest, faithful reporting by the media as to the record of this Administration. It has not been that way. The major media outlets in this country have given an overabundance of attention and prominence to critics who rail in rather broad-based and general ways about the fact that there's a cutback in civil rights enforcement and nobody's doing anything.\nQ. Some civil rights leaders say the Administration has to bear some blame for the incidents in Howard Beach, at the University of Massachusetts and other racially motivated incidents in recent months. How do you respond to that?\nA. It is the case that people are always ready to cast blame elsewhere and say that it's somebody else's fault. The reality is that this Administration, in its policies as well as its practices, has had a pro-civil rights enforcement agenda from the beginning. The civil rights program of this Administration is one that has done more to break down the kinds of Howard Beach resistance that we saw in that particular locality and other places in this country than it has to foster that kind of outrageous behavior.\nQ. If you have segregated housing, doesn't it follow that you will also have a segregated school system and often a segregated workplace?\nA. If you have a community that discriminates in housing, it will be the case that it is also a community that discriminates in other areas. I think that the root of the problem is that there are people of a mind to discriminate. And where we find that, we have to go after them on all fronts, which is what this Administration has been doing.\nQ. Do you think you've personally been unjustly maligned?\nA. This is not an easy job because the issues are controversial, emotional, and people feel very deeply about them. Whenever you are in that kind of a hot seat, a lot that is going to be written about you is driven by where people stand on different sides of the issues. I do think it is unfortunate that as a result of that, a lot of the characterization of me has been sort of as a nasty, insensitive, mean kind of an individual who does not care about these issues or think very deeply about them. That is about as far off the mark as one can get.\nQ. Is there ever a temptation to lash back?\nA. No. I've never had that. It would probably be totally counterproductive, but it's not in my nature to react that way. I'm not sure what I'd say if I tried to lash back.\nQ. You say that you don't lash back or like to engage in personal attacks, but didn't you personally attack Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the Supreme Court?\nA. I did not make a personal attack on Justice Brennan. I think the headlines that accused me of that misrepresented and misstated my speech. My speech responded to Justice Brennan's public speeches, which laid out a philosophy that I took issue with. At no time did I attack him personally or suggest there was any lack of respect for the Justice or for the institution. Justice Brennan and I have discussed since, in a very cordial and friendly conversation, and he said he did not regard it as a personal attack and felt it was the kind of debate that appropriately should be carried on.\nQ. Some Congressional leaders have accused Attorney General Edwin Meese of promoting you to the position of Associate Attorney General, although the Senate rejected your nomination to that post. They cite, for example, your involvement in investigating the Iran arms deal. Are you acting as an Associate? A. I am one of a number of assistant Attorney Generals, and I do the bidding of the Attorney General. There is nothing at all inappropriate for him to turn to me, or to anybody else in this department to assist on a crash program that needs to be staffed, at the highest levels of the department, in order to achieve something that the President has asked be achieved in an impossible time schedule. I don't think there was anything that occurred during my confirmation hearings that would remove me as a possible candidate for the Attorney General to turn to. LENA WILLIAMS

Tauro, who has presided over the suit from the beginning, said in October that the situation had improved enough for the courts to disengage from the case. As a condition, he required Gov. Michael S. Dukakis to set up an office to supervise compliance with the court-ordered plan to improve the facilities and treatment given at five of seven state schools for the mentally retarded.\nWhile the court will still oversee the plan, the state reassumed administration of the schools Tuesday when the Governor set up the Office of Quality Assurance to supervise new construction and renovation, and changes in staffing, programs and administrative policies. The state may also review its 10-year moratorium on admissions to the schools. '21st-Century System of Care'\nAt a ceremony Tuesday at the Walter E. Fernald State School here, Judge Tauro said the court process had taken patients at the facilities from the ''snake pit environment'' that existed at Fernald and the other schools named in the suit - Belchertown, Wrentham and Dever state schools and Monson Developmental Center - ''to a 21st-century system of care.''\nBeginning in 1972, families of residents filed a series of civil suits charging that the poor physical environment and treatment violated the residents' rights to humane care in state institutions.\nPhilip J. Corrigan, 68 years old, who has had two children at Fernald for 30 years, was an initiator of the suit. He recalled that his severely retarded son John, 38, ''lived locked up in a ward environment in an extremely severe disciplinary mode.''\n''Given his short attention span,'' Mr. Corrigan said, ''there was no effort made to train him. He vegetated and we watched him regress on a weekly basis.'' Clandestine Visit to School\nWhen Judge Tauro received the case in 1972, he visited Belchertown State School unannounced.\n''Outside, rolling lawns made it look like a prep school,'' he said in an interview Wednesday. ''But inside, I saw a little girl drinking from a feces-filled commode; bare rooms with no partitions between beds. People were lying on the floor half naked in their own excrement and urine. They had no closets, no doors on toilets.''\n''In another school, I saw 23 blind retarded in one room with one person to supervise, clean, dress and feed them,'' he added. ''There was no elevator in case of fire, and windows didn't work. Young people's bodies were filled with welts from bugs and there was no acoustical relief from constant moaning and screaming.''\nThe judge said the state had tolerated these conditions because ''the retarded didn't have any political clout.''\n''No matter how good government is, it runs on a crisis basis,'' he said. ''Problems of the retarded were put on the back burner. The lawsuit made it a front-burner problem.''\nThe state agreed that the conditions were unconstitutional. Each school was inspected and residents were evaluated to determine the treatment and facilities needed. In 1977 the judge issued the first in a series of orders to bring the schools up to Federal standards.\nThe court-ordered plan focused on improving living conditions, hiring a better-trained staff and placing appropriate residents in more independent, but still supervised, homes in nearby communities. $185 Million for Construction Since 1974, $185 million has been spent on 108 new buildings and on renovations, said a spokesman for the Department of Mental Retardation, Krista L. Stanton. Staffing has been increased to 10,904 in 1986 from 6,377 in 1974, while the number of residents has decreased to 3,463 from 6,276, with about 2,800 going into community homes. The operating budget for the schools has risen to $238 million from $53 million, and for the community homes, to $123 million from $6 million.\nTen years ago the Fernald school had 1,211 residents and 1,400 staff members. ''Physical restraints and psychotropic drugs were used, clients had to borrow underwear and often stayed in buildings all day,'' recalled Joan Greenstein, an administrator. Now Fernald has 874 residents and 2,483 staff members. ''The environment is clean, clients have their own possessions, there are 1 to 4 in bedrooms,'' Ms. Greenstein said.\nMr. Corrigan said: ''In the course of the suit, I managed to have John transferred to a 3,000-acre farm run by Fernald. We can see tremendous physical and mental improvement. Now he gardens and works with horses. Also as a result of Fernald being forced to provide treatment and programming, my daughter, Patricia, 42, who is mildly retarded, is competitively employed at a Federal office near the school. We hope in the future a community residence will be made available to her.''\nBut the Judge, Governor Dukakis, parents and advocates agree that much remains to be done.\nMarc F. Lalley, chairman of the Massachusetts Advisory Council for Mental Health and Mental Retardation, said: ''Many individuals in the community or in state hospitals for the mentally ill could benefit from diagnostic and short-term treatment at these schools but admissions have been closed for 10 years. Also, the staff-client ratios should be higher because the clients remaining are now the neediest.''\nMr. Corrigan said: ''Our concern is that the move toward deinstitutionalization does not destroy facilities for those who cannot be placed in the community. Also, the court was our security blanket. If there's backsliding we hope we can get its attention.''

As majority leader, Mr. Dole occupied one of the most desirable offices in the Capitol. But, come Tuesday, when the 100th Congress convenes and he steps down to the minority, he will, in effect, be handed a renegotiated lease.\n''What we're talking about is prime real estate,'' said Joe Stewart, incoming Senate secretary for the Demcratic majority, who is involved in the delicate task of assigning office space to proud and powerful United States Senators. Mr. Dole has a five-room, 3,740-square-foot office suite on the coveted second floor of the west front of the Capitol, but the incoming majority leader, Robert C. Byrd, says Mr. Dole will have to give up 1,100 feet of it. Mr. Byrd, who makes do with 2,600 square feet, is cutting Mr. Dole back to roughly the same amount, and neither Mr. Dole nor his staff is happy about it.\nThe rifts may seem minor, but some Senate staff members say the underlying conflict is much deeper and grows out of a strong conviction on the part of Senate Democrats that Senator Dole as majority leader made almost all decisions on a partisan basis. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, Democrats say they are restoring institutional parity but Republicans feel they are being punished.\nWASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING
838	WITNESS, IN FIRST PUBLIC STATEMENT, ASSAILS INQUIRY INTO QUEENS ATTACK	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D7133BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A black witness who was beaten by whites in the Howard Beach attack said yesterday that the police had disputed and discounted portions of his story from the start, had treated him more like a criminal than a victim and had conducted a ''masquerade investigation.''\nA black witness who was beaten by whites in the Howard Beach attack said yesterday that the police had disputed and discounted portions of his story from the start, had treated him more like a criminal than a victim and had conducted a ''masquerade investigation.''\n''I tried to tell the story and nobody listened to it,'' the witness, Cedric Sandiford, declared at a news conference in Harlem in his first public statement on the case. ''They only wanted to hear part of it and they tried to discredit the other part of it.''\nMr. Sandiford's lawyers have said repeatedly that he told the police he saw a car strike and kill his companion. The police have said Mr. Sandiford told them he did not see the crash.\nMr. Sandiford, who has refused to cooperate with prosecutors, gave no new details on circumstances surrounding the death of his stepson, Michael Griffith, who was struck and killed on the Shore Parkway as he fled a beating by white youths in Howard Beach, Queens, early Dec. 20.\nBut he said the police who picked him up on the highway where Mr. Griffith was killed had refused to listen to his account of the attack, had not offered him medical attention for injuries sustained in the beating and had questioned him about a shooting in Queens.\nAt the scene of the crash, he said, he stood by and was ignored for three and a half hours, then was taken to the 106th Precinct station house and searched. After telling his story to investigators, he said, a police supervisor told him, ''It didn't happen that way.'' Shooting Inquiry Acknowledged\nAlice T. McGillion, the Deputy Police Commissioner in charge of public information, denied Mr. Sandiford's allegations. She said investigators had not disputed or discounted his story and the police had treated him ''like a victim and a very important witness.''\nShe said that Mr. Sandiford was asked ''numerous times'' if he wanted medical attention and ''he refused it numerous times.'' The police nevertheless called an ambulance and Mr. Sandiford agreed to go to Jamaica Hospital for treatment only after the ambulance crew asked him to sign a waiver releasing them from responsibility.\nMs. McGillion acknowledged that the officers who picked Mr. Sandiford up on the parkway ''asked him if he knew anything'' about a shooting that had just occurred nearby, but she added: ''He was never treated as a suspect'' in that case, which turned out to be a shooting in a drug dispute.\nFlanked by his lawyers and other blacks at the crowded news conference at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, Mr. Sandiford said he was ''disappointed'' with Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward, Governor Cuomo and others for attempting to ''discredit my lawyer.''\nMr. Sandiford said it was his decision, not that of his principal lawyer, Alton H. Maddox Jr., to refuse to cooperate with the police and Queens District Attorney John J. Santucci in the prosecution of three white youths charged with reckless endangerment in the case. Murder and other serious charges against them were dropped last Monday after Mr. Sandiford refused to testify at a preliminary hearing.\nMr. Sandiford, a 36-year-old Brooklyn resident who spoke forcefully with the Caribbean lilt of his native Guyana, echoed Mr. Maddox's call for a special prosecutor to supersede Mr. Santucci.\n''Until Governor Cuomo assigns someone to investigate this case,'' he declared, ''I won't cooperate with no one. That's all I have to say.''\nWhen reporters attempted to ask him whether he saw Mr. Griffith struck by the car, his lawyers intervened and said they would not permit him to answer questions about key aspects of the case because doing so might compromise any independent inquiry. Getting the 'System to Work'\nMr. Sandiford spoke for less than 10 minutes with reporters in a cramped meeting room on the third floor of the church, at 132 West 138th Street between Lenox and Seventh Avenues, and his lawyers, Mr. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason, and several supporters dominated the two-hour news conference.\nThe lawyers were asked whether their priority was the prosecution of the white youths or a broader effort to attack racism and organize and assist the black community.\n''The priority,'' Mr. Mason said, ''is to get the system to work.'' Later, he told a reporter: ''This is bigger than Michael Griffith. We have an agenda to make sure there are no more Michael Griffiths.''\nAsked what they would do to assure the prosecution of the case if an independent prosecutor were not appointed, Mr. Mason said, ''We're not going to tell you what we're going to do.''\nThe lawyers berated political leaders, the police, prosecutors, the courts and segments of the news media, saying that they perpetuated a racist system in which justice was denied to blacks.\n''We are engaged in a system that expects lawyers to participate in coverups, to participate in the injustice that pervades the courts in this state,'' Mr. Maddox said. If a lawyer refuses, he said, ''then that person becomes the butt or the target of a new lynch mob.''\nAs another example, the lawyers cited a 17-year-old black spectator, David Vandiver, who they said was struck in the mouth by a white player at a basketball game at the College of Staten Island last Tuesday. They said that despite the youth's complaint, the police had refused to press charges.\nThe police said officers had noted the complaint and referred him to court to press a charge because a coach, an assistant coach and another school official had told them the white player had not struck the black spectator. They said the police had discretion to refer cases to court if they involve no serious injury or criminal conduct.\nThe lawyers, criticizing coverage of the Howard Beach affair by the ''establishment media,'' said they would rely on the black media to ''report to our people'' on the Howard Beach affair and called for a black boycott of ''establishment media.''\nIn addition, the lawyers called for a black boycott of pizzerias throughout the city. It was outside the New Park Pizzeria, at Cross Bay Boulevard and 157th Avenue in Howard Beach, that the whites first attacked Mr. Griffth, Mr. Sandiford and Timothy Grimes, according to the police account.\nMr. Grimes escaped after being hit once. The other men were chased eight blocks and beaten again at 156th Avenue and 86th Street before fleeing through a hole in a fence onto the Shore Parkway, where Mr. Griffith was struck by a car driven by Dominick Blum, 24, a court officer. Mr. Blum left the scene, returned and was not charged after he told the police he thought he had hit a tire or an animal.\nAccording to the police account, Mr. Sandiford told them he saw a dark car twice in the episode, once during the chase and again on the parkway, but they quoted him as having said he did not witness the fatal crash. The police also have said their investigation showed Mr. Blum was not an accomplice of the white youths and that he had killed Mr. Griffith accidentally.\nMr. Maddox and Mr. Mason have given a sharply conflicting version, saying that Mr. Sandiford saw the crash and that Mr. Blum was a willing accomplice. They have charged repeatedly that the police and prosecutors were suppressing part of Mr. Sandiford's story in an effort to cover up for Mr. Blum and the white youths.\nMr. Maddox and Mr. Mason have not provided detailed evidence to support their allegations.\nGovernor Cuomo has asked Charles J. Hynes, a Deputy Attorney General who is the state's Special Prosecutor for the Criminal Justice System in New York City, to look into the lawyers' allegations that the police and prosecutors have mishandled the case. Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason said they would not cooperate with Mr. Hynes unless an independent prosecutor was named.
839	INVESTIGATORS SIFT HOTEL FOR CLUES IN SAN JUAN FIRE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D7133BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The police received a threat of a bomb at the Dupont Plaza Hotel two hours before the fire that took at least 95 lives here on New Year's Eve, a high police official said today. But investigators said they had found no physical evidence that there had been a bomb.\nThe police received a threat of a bomb at the Dupont Plaza Hotel two hours before the fire that took at least 95 lives here on New Year's Eve, a high police official said today. But investigators said they had found no physical evidence that there had been a bomb.\nRobert J. Creighton, the special agent in charge of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, whose office has jurisdiction over Puerto Rico, said finding evidence of a bomb could be a slow process.\n''A fire scene is extremely fragile,'' he said. ''You can't use a bulldozer. Agents have to work with sifting screens and microscopes to examine little pieces because even a tiny piece of a battery or a watch face could mean an awful lot.'' 'No Problems,' Officers Told\nJose L. Lopez, senior spokesman for the commonwealth's Police Department, said the threat that a bomb had been planted on the premises of the 22-story hotel was made in a telephone call to a police station near the hotel at 1:41 P.M. Wednesday. The caller identified himself as ''Santiago,'' Mr. Lopez said.\nIn 15 minutes, he said, two officers were dispatched to the Dupont Plaza, where they were told by members of the hotel staff that ''there were no problems, everything was normal.'' The officers, Mr. Lopez said, ''went back to the station and made a report.'' About an hour and a half later, at 3:30 P.M., the fire broke out.\nMr. Lopez said he had not read that report but indicated that the officers might well have decided the warning was an unfounded threat. Hotel 'Looking Into It'\nA spokesman for the hotel, Rissig Licha, said he did not know if the hotel's staff members spoke with the police about the bomb threat on Wednesday or if they checked with management before sending the police officers away. ''We're looking into it,'' he said. If the staff members had spoken with the officers, he added, ''they should have notified the management.''\nAs forensic teams worked today to identify those killed in the blaze and searchers once more hunted for victims in the hotel, the body count remained at 95. Danny Velez, a spokesman for Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, said, ''We hope there are no more.''\nIt was erroneously reported on Friday that one of the victims was Margaret Ahrens, a soprano who is a prominent performer of contemporary music in New York. Although the list of victims includes a Margaret Ahrens of Oceanside, L.I., she is not the musician and composer.\nReports conflicted today on how many of the people injured in the blaze remained hospitalized. The Secretary of State's office released a list of 21 people still hospitalized, while the Secretary of Health's office said 34 remained in hospitals, some of them in serious condition. A few of the injured are suffering burns, and the rest are being treated for smoke inhalation and trauma.\nTeams from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal firearms bureau and the Justice Department held a two-and-a-half-hour meeting this morning on coordinating their operations.\nMr. Creighton of the firearms bureau said the investigation was focusing on ''several points of interest'' on the first floor of the hotel and below the casino. Investigators, he said, ''try to read the fire, the blast effects, looking for burn patterns and shearing effects on metal that could indicate an explosion.'' Looking for 'Starting Point'\n''They will look for the seat of any explosion, the starting point,'' he said.\nTwo Federal investigators who declined to be identified, as well as a local fire official, Juan R. Garcia, said it seemed doubtful at this point that a bomb had caused the fire. The explosions witnesses and survivors heard Wednesday afternoon, investigators suggested, could have been windows breaking under the pressure created by the fire.\n''We still believe it was arson,'' one investigator said, ''but the thinking now is, it looks almost like a prank that got out of hand.''\nHector Rivera Cruz, Puerto Rico's Secretary of Justice, declined today to say whether bomb fragments had been found. He also said no clear evidence of arson had been found, while saying that arson was the most likely cause of the blaze.\nMr. Rivera Cruz said ''more than 150 witnesses'' had been questioned and that evidence was being removed from the charred building. No arrests have been made, according to the Police Superintendent, Carlos Lopez Feliciano. Another Warning Is Reported\nIn addition to the police disclosure of the bomb threat, a report of a separate warning was published on the front page of The San Juan Star this morning. The newspaper quoted ''a reliable source'' in the island government as saying three men had told the Special Investigations Bureau of the commonwealth's Justice Department about a warning they had received. The men, who were not identified in the article, said a union official had told them Wednesday to ''get out'' of the hotel casino ''right now because things are going to happen any minute now,'' the newspaper reported.\nThe article said the union official added: ''We are either going to close this hotel down or some people are going to get killed.'' The article said the warning came ''about 10 or 15 minutes'' before the fire.\nMr. Rivera Cruz declined today to comment on the report.\nA meeting of about 125 members of Local 901 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents the hotel employees, concluded just before the fire broke out. Local and Federal investigators have speculated that a labor-management dispute at the Dupont Plaza may have played a part in the disaster.\nAsked today about The Star's report, Jose E. Cadiz, the president of the teamsters' local, said the union leadership knew nothing about plans to bomb or set fire to the hotel or about any prior warnings. In heated contract negotiations, he said, ''People do things, say things, make threats on their own.'' 'Always Negotiating'\nNegotiations with the management on a new contract, he said, had actually been going well. Although members had voted Dec. 22 in favor of a strike, he said, ''we were convinced we were not going to have a strike - the vote was more of a bargaining chip.''\nMr. Cadiz said that in the six years he had headed the 5,200-member union there had been only one strike, and no violence. The union has 150 contracts, he said, and is ''always negotiating.''\nArmy pathologists and other forensic specialists are performing autopsies and trying to identify the dead through fingerprints or by comparing teeth with dental records, or from jewelry and traces of clothing.\nHarry Gaynor, president of the National Burn Victims Foundation in Orange, N.J., said in an interview here today that positive identification was extremely difficult after fires as severe as the one at the Dupont Plaza. Praise for Searchers\nPeople who have been removing bodies from the fire rubble, he said, are victims themselves, psychologically, and are being overlooked. ''Even if they think they are macho guys who can handle this, experience shows that's not so,'' he said. ''They may suffer from depression nightmares. They may start to drink and smoke. They should be provided with counseling.''\nMr. Gaynor criticized the hotel's management for not installing a sprinkler system throughout the building. ''No one has ever lost their life in a sprinkled building,'' he said. ''It's a vital safety feature that was lacking. There's a message here.'' Hotel spokesmen have acknowledged that sprinklers were in place in only three isolated locations, adding that local regulations did not require more of the devices.
840	PROTESTERS EXPRESS FRUSTRATION AND MISTRUST	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D6133BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: They had seen it all before, the protesters said - white assailants, black victims and justice continually deferred.\nThey had seen it all before, the protesters said - white assailants, black victims and justice continually deferred.\nThere was William Turks, they said, a black man who was chased and killed by a group of whites in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn. Then Eleanor Bumpurs and Michael Stewart, even an honors student, Edmund Perry - all killed, they said, in racially motivated attacks involving the police.\nNow, the protesters said yesterday, the spectre of racism has been raised in another death, and they had gathered at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem to rally against the racial hatred they said had left Michael Griffith dead in Howard Beach, Queens.\n''Civil rights hasn't improved anything for blacks,'' said Raenice Goode, a black woman who is a member of the Eleanor Bumpurs Committee. ''This kind of thing happens all the time.''\nThe attack and death of Mr. Griffith, many blacks say, has renewed deep-seated frustrations and anger among blacks at law-enforcement officials, the government, news organizations and whites in general.\nIn a small, third-floor room adjacent to the church, the lawyers for the two surviving victims of the Howard Beach attack held a news conference and called for a movement for black empowerment, including boycotts of pizza parlors and ''insensitive'' news organizations.\n''In the future, we will reward our friends and punish our enemies,'' said one of the lawyers, Alton H. Maddox Jr. Next door, blacks from communities throughout the city spoke of mass meetings, youth demonstrations and picketing.\nAfter the two-hour rally ended, about 50 high school and college students marched to Gracie Mansion to denounce Mayor Koch and other city officials. Some chanted, ''Howard Beach is America.'' Others carried signs, some of which read, ''Justice will be done'' and ''Stop Racist Attitudes or Else.''\n''Do not venture into unfamiliar neighborhoods or hostile territories,'' Lisa Williamson, head of the National African Youth Student Alliance, told the crowd. Not in small numbers, she added. ''Be realistic. Carry a stick, stone, or a weapon.''\nMany at the rally complained of the way law-enforcement officials have handled the Howard Beach assault and other cases. Although the circumstances and legal results differed markedly, many said they saw the Turks, Bumpurs, Stewart and Perry deaths in the same light as the Howard Beach attack. All too often, they said, the legal system fails to provide justice when blacks are victims.\nSix transit police officers were acquitted of any wrongdoing in the case of Mr. Stewart, who died after being taken into custody on charges of painting graffiti in a subway station. Mr. Perry was shot by a police officer who said Mr. Perry had tried to mug him. No charges were brought against the officer.\nThe officer who shot Mrs. Bumpurs in a confrontation over an eviction goes on trial Jan. 12 on manslaughter charges. Three youths were convicted in the beating death of Mr. Turks.\n''You can look at life in the inner city as a game of monopoly,'' said Michael Maechem, who attended the rally. ''Whenever blacks start winning, they change the rules. The 106th Precinct is the stun-gun precinct. They already have no credibility.'' Two officers from the 106th were convicted in 1986 of using a stun gun on black prisoners, and charges against three other officers are pending.

And of the 225 plays in this Super Bowl XXI playoff, the Jets later talked mostly of only one - a roughing-the-passer penalty against Mark Gastineau that revived the Browns with less than 4 minutes remaining.\n''It wasn't roughing,'' Gastineau would say. ''I was just following through.''\nAt the time the Jets were in command, 20-10, and the Browns were backed up on their own 18-yard line. In a second-and-24, Bernie Kosar threw a pass. Incomplete. But just as the ball skidded off the ground upfield, Referee Ben Dreith's yellow handkerchief was floating to the ground near where Kosar had been leveled, slammed in the back by the Jets' 265-pound defensive end.\n''It was definitely roughing the passer,'' Kosar said later. ''I thought I'd been broken in two.''\n''He's a referee,'' said Marty Lyons, the Jets' other defensive end, ''who's known to take care of the quarterback.''\n''I couldn't stop,'' Gastineau added. ''I've done that a lot of times without it being called.''\nJoe Walton, the Jets' coach, would say only, ''It was a very key play, Mark was just trying to do the best he could do.'' But the Jets' defensive coordinator, Bud Carson, did not excuse Gastineau's mistake.\n''I felt it was so dumb,'' Carson said. ''It was really dumb, but in fairness to Mark, he's had very little conditioning lately.''\nGastineau was wearing a brace on his damaged left knee that kept him out of the last five games of the regular season. Carson seemed to be saying that if Gastineau had been playing on a stable knee, he might have been able to stop instead of smashing into the Browns' passer. But the defensive coordinator also put the penalty in perspective.\n''We had a lot of situations in which we've been aggressive, but not smart aggressive,'' Carson said. ''We've never quite found out how to play smart aggressive.''\nInstead of being confronted with a third-and-24 at their own 18, the Browns suddenly had a new life, a first down at their 33. From there, Kosar, who would complete 33 of 64 passes for 489 yards, positioned Kevin Mack's 1-yard touchdown that lifted the Browns to 20-17. In the final seconds Kosar's 37-yard pass preceded Mark Moseley's tying 22-yard field goal with 7 seconds remaining. And after having missed a 23-yard chip shot early in the overtime, Moseley's 27-yard field goal in overtime ended the strangest season in the Jets' history.\nIn a sense, yesterday's loss mirrored the Jets' season. Just as they hurried to a 10-1 start in their schedule, they were ahead, 20-10, and just as they finished in an 0-5 slump, they finished weakly in the sunny chill of Municipal Stadium.\nFor all the Jets' complaints about the Gastineau penalty, after that penalty their offense with Ken O'Brien at quarterback couldn't generate any yardage and their defense couldn't stop Kosar's offense. O'Brien, benched a week ago when Ryan inspired the Jets to their 35-10 wild-card victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, had returned in the second quarter with the Jets trailing, 10-7. Pat Ryan limped off with a damaged groin muscle that he had pulled in the warm-up.\n''It's frustrating, coming away with nothing,'' O'Brien said. ''That's the whole thing, you come away with nothing. Who cares how long you play.''\nO'Brien completed 11 of 19 passes for 134 yards after Ryan had hit 6 of 11 for 103 yards. But in the overtime, O'Brien appeared to be as helpless as he had been in the Jets' 0-5 finish. In three series in the overtime, he generated only 19 net yards as the Jets punted from their 41, 38 and 14.\nKosar, meanwhile, was strafing the Jets' defense for the Jets' sixth loss in their last seven games.\nIn shattering Otto Graham's club playoff record of 297 passing yards, set in the 1950 championship victory over the Los Angeles Rams, the poised 23-year-old quarterback had only one bad moment, an interception in the end zone by Russell Carter, the Jets' right cornerback, early in the fourth quarter.\n''That's Bernie Kosar,'' said Marty Schottenheimer, the Browns' coach. ''He's a championship player.'' Two years ago Kosar passed the University of Miami to the final No. 1 ranking in college football. And next Sunday he has an opportunity to pass the Browns to the American Conference title against the winner of today's divisional playoff at Denver between the Broncos and the New England Patriots.\nBut on their winning drive in overtime, the Browns fooled the Jets by calling seven running plays against a defense designed to stop Kosar's passes.\n''They called a lot of trap plays,'' Marty Lyons said. ''When you've got all those defensive backs in there, you don't have that strength in the middle that you need to stop the run. It was excellent play calling on their part. Our defensive game plan was to put a lot of pressure on Kosar, to shut down their running and to control the line of scrimmage. We played good for 56 minutes, but we forgot the last 4 minutes.''\nAnd when the third longest game in pro football history ended, Lyons sat on the dirt field for several seconds.\n''I couldn't believe we had lost,'' he would say later. ''We had worked so hard all year, we had worked so hard all week, we had worked so hard all day.''\nBut when Mark Gastineau's penalty gave the Browns new life, they won a game that the Jets might have won and should have won.\nSPORTS OF THE TIMES

843	AROUND THE GARDEN	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED6133BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: This Week:\nThis Week:\nOn cold nights, move tender house plants away from windowsills. . . . Cut back long canes of roses so they do not whip in high winds. . . . Do not overfeed house plants at this time of year as many of them are resting or what is called semi-dormant. Protection\nAlthough it is January, there is still time to use anti-transpirants on the foliage of evergreens, particularly rhododendrons, hollies and evergreen azaleas. Even special conifers with their needled foliage benefit from these sprays. The sprays are invisible coatings to prevent sunburn and desiccation when winds howl and the sun bakes. Just be sure the air temperture is warm - above 40 degrees - so the leaves will dry off before nightfall and the spray equipment will not clog. Clean Them Out\nNew catalogues from seed houses and nurseries are filling up mail boxes. The old ones must be tossed to make room. But be judicious about throwing out the old for the new. Some catalogues are generous with cultural pointers and garden planning; others are resplendent with pictures and serve as good reference material when particular plants bloom. They help to recall, ''What was that we ordered?''\nAlso remember some catalogues will not arrive by mail if the company has not received an order in the last year or two. Mailing and publishing has become expensive and many companies are cutting their lists if potential customers do not respond. Hard to Find\nSome garden tools and accessories are hard to find. Even though gardeners are diligent about pouring through source catalogues, some products don't seem to exist. Or do they? A few special mail order catalogues offer these obscure items. If particular products are needed, these may be worth adding to the source library.\nFor those who own home greenhouses, proper tools and supplies are a must. Gro-Tek, South Berwick, Maine 03908 (catalogue $1.) offers many greenhouse and garden supplies. This is the place to find a 50-foot watering hose ($9.50) or trickle irrigation kits ($14.95). The catalogue also lists labels, sunshades, greenhouses glazing, fans, thermostats and quantity shipments of plastic pots and flats.\nWalt F. Nicke's ''Garden Talk'' catalogue (19 Columbia Turnpike, Hudson, N.Y. 12534, 50 cents) includes long-sought tools and accessories, many of them imports from European manufacturers. The extraordinary plant supports of galvanized wire made by Scottish War Blinded are available in several sizes with sets of three legs ranging in heights from 18-inches to 3 feet. Solo sprayers from England with slide-type double action are under $25. From Denmark are stainless steel hand tools; a set of three is $7.95.\nThe Necessary Trading Company, New Castle, Va. 24127 publishes its ''newsalogue'' twice a year. Their search is ''to find better tools and techniques for managing Earth's precious resources'' . . . and offering ''products for non-toxic lifestyles.'' The company lists hard-to-find items such as diatomaceous earth for insect control (one pound $3.75) and Bonide Sulfur Fungicide, a wettable sulfur product at $4 a pound.\nMellinger's, 2310 West South Range Road, North Lima, Ohio 44452 offers just about everything in its catalogue. Its index starts with abelia and finishes with a zone map. In between the 104 pages are listings for plants, fertilizers, pruning and grafting tools, insecticides, trellises, weed controls and seeds. This is a veritable supply house for the home gardener as well as small-scale nurseryman. QuestionsAnswers BLACK LEAVES Many leaves on our gardenia have turned black, but the plant is full of flower buds. What shall we do? Mrs. W.W., Manhattan.\nControl the mealybugs. The black leaves are a secondary problem called black sooty mold which forms on the ''honeydew'' exuded by mealybugs. The insects should be controlled first before the fungus problem can be cleared up. Look on backs of leaves and in leaf axils for these insects which appear as white cottony masses. If badly infested, the plant can be turned upside down and hosed off in the kitchen sink using fingers to rub off the insects. (Hold the soil ball secure with one hand.) After cleaning the gardenia, spray the plant every three to four days with a household insecticide labeled for mealybug control. The plant should bloom normally. For mild infestations, wipe off insects individually with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol. The blackened leaves should also be wiped clean with a damp paper towel. Mealybug is a form of scale which feeds on the sugar rich sap of many plants. Its population builds up as the insect is rarely seen unless leaves are turned over or leaf axils are checked. Sooty molds can also develop from the sap feeding of other house plant insects including scale, white fly and aphids. IMPATIENS\nThis year we want to grow our own impatiens from seed. When should we begin indoors to be sure of having blooming-size plants to set out in the garden in early May? G.L.L., Morristown, N.J.\nPlan on three months. Impatiens seed is slow to germinate and the plants should have at least 10 weeks to grow indoors to be sturdy enough to plant outside. Another important step, never cover impatiens seed as it needs light to germinate. It will not ''come up'' for about two weeks. Keep the seed pots or pans warm. The pot or pan can be slipped into a plastic bag to keep moisture uniform. Transplant the seedlings to individual pots when the second pair of true leaves appears. IVY ON TREES\nIvy is growing on the trunks of my oak and maple trees, which I find quite attractive. Is this harmful? Should it be removed? C.E.H., Demarest, N.J.\nNo. Ivy growing up tree trunks can be decorative. It clings by tendrils which permit the climber to hold fast. Watch over the vine, however.

844	Moseley Glad He Got the Message	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DF103BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Six weeks ago Mark Moseley, a laid-off professional kicker, was leaving a television show in New York when a clerk handed him a message from Art Modell, the owner of the Cleveland Browns.\nSix weeks ago Mark Moseley, a laid-off professional kicker, was leaving a television show in New York when a clerk handed him a message from Art Modell, the owner of the Cleveland Browns.\n''Right, sure,'' Moseley said to himself and pocketed the slip of paper, sure it was a crank call. Moseley had been cut by the Washington Redskins six weeks before and the 38-year-old veteran was beginning to think that his career really was over.\nBut back at his hotel Moseley had second thoughts and he picked up the phone. A good thing for the Browns, who that day had lost their regular kicker. This afternoon, during an emotional roller-coaster of an American Conference playoff game, Moseley kicked the winning field goal 2 minutes 2 seconds into the second overtime to end the third longest game in professional football history.\n''Marty came up to me and simply said, 'Go kick it, and let's go home,' '' Moseley said, referring to Marty Schottenheimer, the Browns' coach. Holder Almost Misses Call\nEven then something nearly went wrong. Moseley's holder, Jeff Gossett, the punter, did not hear the hurried call of 'Kick, Kick' and barely made it on to the field to hold.\nEarly in the first 15-minute overtime, it looked as if Moseley might have squandered the game when he missed a 23-yarder.\n''I don't know what happened,'' he said. ''It was soft there. As I hit the ball, I was falling away from it. I nearly missed the ball completely. I knew right away it was bad. You have to be strong enough to accept the failures and get ready for the next chance.''\nThe groans by the Browns fans in the crowd of 78,106, starved for a playoff victory since 1969, confirmed his worst fears.\nBut the defense kept stopping the Jets. ''I've never experienced or seen a comeback like that,'' said Schottenheimer. ''Just before we said our prayer in the locker room afterwards, I told the players to listen. You could still hear the people cheering for us.'' Jets Tougher Than Expected\n''The Jets were tougher than we expected,'' said Ozzie Newsome, the tight end. ''Much tougher. But Bernie took us down. He got that look in his eye. And we all knew we could do it.''\nKosar said he watched his alma mater, the University of Miami, lose Friday night in the Fiesta Bowl with Vinny Testaverde, who is two weeks older than Kosar, being intercepted five times.\nThe 23-year-old Kosar's 1.9 percent regular season interception rate (10 interceptions on 531 attempts) was the lowest in the league. But today the Jets picked off two passes, both in the fourth quarter. ''I didn't lose my confidence,'' Kosar said, ''Of course, the thought crossed my mind, but I didn't want to end that way.''\nNewsome said the offense sensed Kosar's poise. With less than four minutes remaining in regular time, the Browns were down 10 points when Kosar marched them for a touchdown and a field goal. ''Four minutes seemed like a long time,'' Kosar said.\n''It sure did look like an uphill battle,'' said defensive back Frank Minnifield, ''Like everyone else in the stadium, I started getting that sinking feeling. But once we got into overtime there was no doubt in my mind we'd win.'' Browns 3 for 3 in Overtime\nThis was the third Browns overtime game and third overtime victory this year. ''I've been on some good teams,'' Moseley said. ''And this is a good team. It has character. After two interceptions, a lot of young quarterbacks would have started talking to themselves on the sidelines. You'll see that kid around here for a very long time.''\nMoseley himself might not be around next year if Matt Bahr returns from injury. Asked about his miss in overtime, his third miss of the day, Moseley said:\n''I'd sure hate for that to have been my last shot. That would have been a heavy burden to carry around. I just went over to the sideline and said a little prayer and asked for another chance. This team is so close-knit. And we got it.'' Kosar answered reporters' questions, grabbed a quick shower and left, clutching, not a game ball, but a 1986 Ohio license plate from his car. The plate had expired, but time had not. ''I don't want to get in any trouble,'' said the winning quarterback.
845	EXOTIC TEXTILES	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DE103BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Over the last 14 years, Pierre Apraxine has acquired his collection of more than a score of exotic textiles - from an ancient Egyptian applique of a baboon-god to a 1910 peacock-patterned sarong from Java. Now these weavings are being exhibited together for the first time in ''Textiles from the Collection of Pierre Apraxine,'' on view through Jan.\nOver the last 14 years, Pierre Apraxine has acquired his collection of more than a score of exotic textiles - from an ancient Egyptian applique of a baboon-god to a 1910 peacock-patterned sarong from Java. Now these weavings are being exhibited together for the first time in ''Textiles from the Collection of Pierre Apraxine,'' on view through Jan. 16 at the Martin and Ullman Artweave Textile Gallery, 310 Riverside Drive, at 103d Street. After the show closes, Mr. Apraxine plans to sell his collection.\nThe exhibition may be small but its range is uncommonly wide. The 22 selections include works from Asia, the Middle East, Europe and South America that are as varied in their cultural expression as in the techniques of weaving, dying and stitchery employed and the forms represented. Dramatizing the splendid high-ceilinged Art Deco spaces of this gallery are wall hangings, bed coverings, curtains, shawls, robes, sarongs, jackets, a hat and an arresting example of a thermal undergarment.\nMr. Apraxine, art curator of the Gilman Paper Company, explained last weekend that what he had initially experienced as a collecting adventure had run its course. The ''life cycle'' of accumulating these weavings is probably now over for him, he said. At the outset, he recalled, each textile was a discovery that told him something about the history of weaving and something about his own responses to this art form. He said he was attracted to the first weaving that he purchased - a 19th-century Uzbekistan hanging - while working as an assistant curator in contenporary painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art.\n''I saw in this textile a random disposition of color,'' Mr. Apraxine said. ''The harmony that resulted reminded me of what Sol LeWitt was doing at the time, when he was using five colors and random lines.'' The Central Asian ikat weaving, a silk warp on white cotton, boldly patterned with gourds of different shapes and sizes in purple, red and blue, is an unusually bold and simple application in weaving of the traditional printed paisley motifs.\nWith his second purchase, Mr. Apraxine said, the references changed from art to life. The Uzbekistan work he chose, a silk embroidered hanging covered with tiny blossoms, is as wildly colorful as a field of flowers in summer. ''Basically my origins are Russian - way back we came from Mongolia,'' he said. ''That flower-covered textile rang a bell; I felt it belonged to me.''\nAfter that, the references were sometimes personal and sometimes intellectual. ''My eye is trained in form by contemporary art, and so it is applying that understanding that gives the collection a kind of unity,'' he said. Mr. Apraxine's textiles frequently combine complex figural patterns with rich textures. One of the more intricate uses of patterns is a Sino-Tibetan tanka, woven between the 15th and 17th centuries, a silk embroidered work with brocade borders framing stitched images of rams, aquatic monsters, dancing goddesses and a Buddha. The iconography of this work is Tibetan but the craftmanship is Chinese - a rare combination.\nThe most important work in the show - a Ming 17th-century Chinese silk tapestry depicting wild birds, deer, exotic flowers and trees -glows with irridescence from the peacock feathers used in its weaving.\nMr. Apraxine's partiality to textiles that were made to be worn outnumber the rest of the pieces and include several stunning kimonos, as well as robes, shawls, jackets and tunics. Among these garments are some of the most exquisitely delicate textiles in the show - gossamer works embellished with bold images that result in magical contrasts. Gold brocade leaves grace the arms and back of a gauze-fine Japanese 18th-century Noh costume. The five pieces in a set of pre-Columbian ritual weavings - a hat, mantle, turban, band and loin cloth worn by a Chimu lord of the 14th or 15th century - are white-on-white cotton works patterned with pelicans and large dots.\nTextures dominate on some works, including a pre-Columbian hat dating to possibly 600 A.D. that combines a crocheted wool cap and micro-braids of human hair. Another offbeat selection is an 18th-century Chinese thermal jacket, fashioned from bamboo tubes and cotton cord, that was conceived to be worn as insulation between layers of garments.\nAmong the simplest works are two Egyptian pieces. On one, a robustly woven Coptic linen tunic of the sixth century, squares of shadowy dancing figures in deep blue and gold, the color of wheat, are surprisingly refined in detailing. On the other, a painted linen fragment almost seven inches square, stitched by a master needleworker in the Ptolomaic period between 323 and 30 B.C., is dominated by an aristocratic-looking appliqued baboon depicting the god Hapy, probably part of a coffin decoration.\nMr. Apraxine was born in Estonia and educated in Belgium, where he served as an adviser in the 1960's for Baron Leon Lambert's collection of modern and primitive art. After Mr. Apraxine came to New York in 1970, he was an assistant curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art for several years, and in 1975 became the curator at Gilman of its photography collection. ''Home was nowhere and I lived like a nomad - everything I owned could go into a suitcase,'' he recalled. That explains part of the attraction of weavings. ''These textiles were portable gardens,'' he said.\nOnce he became more deeply involved in collecting, however, he realized that there was more to handling textiles than folding them or rolling them up so that they can be transported easily. To display and store fabrics poses problems, he said, noting that the ideal environment for most textiles is dust-free, dry and away from natural light.\nGail Martin, one of the gallery's three partners, said that the collection is being sold as a unit for an undisclosed price that is ''well into six figures'' She pointed out that virtually all of the collection was purchased by Mr. Apraxine at the gallery or with the advice of herself and her partners, Ocsi Ullmann and Vladimir Haustov.\nOther selections offered at this 15-year-old gallery range from about $3,000 to $100,000, and include archeological and ethnic works that have come from most of the same periods and places as can be seen in Mr. Apraxine's collection.\nANTIQUES
846	JETS ELIMINATED BY BROWNS IN OVERTIME	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE103BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The season finally ran out on the Jets today, but it took the third-longest game in pro football history and a magnificent Browns comeback to close it.\nThe season finally ran out on the Jets today, but it took the third-longest game in pro football history and a magnificent Browns comeback to close it.\nAt the end, it came down to Mark Moseley, the erratic, 38-year-old kicker closing out his 15th season. After missing a 23-yard boot earlier in sudden-death play, he kicked the winner, a 27-yarder toward Lake Erie.\nThat shot gave the Browns a 23-20 victory after 17 minutes 2 seconds of overtime and sent them into the American Conference championship game here next Sunday. The Browns (13-4) will play the winner of the divisional playoff game between the Broncos and the New England Patriots Sunday in Denver.\nThe Jets held a 20-10 lead with a little more than four minutes remaining in regulation despite an injury to Pat Ryan, their starting quarterback. O'Brien Replaces Ryan\nRyan, who replaced Ken O'Brien as the starter in the wild-card playoff victory over the Kansas City Chiefs last week, reinjured a groin pull he had suffered during today's warm-ups. So O'Brien relieved him in the second quarter, with the Jets trailing by 10-7.\nThough the Jets opened a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter, neither quarterback was able to generate much offense. The Jets managed only 2 third-down conversions in 18 attempts, and 9 sacks by the Browns equaled a playoff record. O'Brien had been at the helm in the Jets' five straight season-ending losses, when their record plummeted to 10-6.\nYet, the Jet defense, despite giving up a playoff record of 558 net yards, kept the Browns from catching up until the final minutes of the fourth quarter. That's when Bernie Kosar, with only one timeout remaining, led a pair of scoring drives. One went for a touchdown (helped by a key roughing-the-passer call against Mark Gastineau), and the other ended with Moseley's tying field goal with only 7 seconds remaining. Records for Kosar\nOn his longest day, Kosar equaled a playoff record with 33 pass completions and set post-season records for passing with 64 attempts and 489 yards.\nIt was Cleveland's first playoff victory since 1969, and the first playoff victory for a Central Division champion after one-game elmininations the previous three years. This Browns team, though, knows how to hang in.\nTo Coach Marty Schottenheimer of the Browns, it was ''the opportunity to experience one of the finest games in the history of this sport.''\nBut it was something less to Coach Joe Walton of the Jets, who said, ''It's a very empty feeling.''\nOvertime in the playoffs does not end after a 15-minute quarter, as it does in the regular season when tie games are possible. So after 15 scoreless minutes today, the teams went into a second overtime, which ended after 2:02 on Moseley's kick. The only longer games were in the 1971 playoffs when the Dolphins defeated the Chiefs 22:40 into overtime and a 1962 American Football League playoff game in which the Dallas Texans beat the Oilers 17:54 into overtime.\nMoseley prevented this one from going any longer, even though he had missed three of his first five field-goal attempts today.\n''It's phenomenal the opportunity I've had to win games over the years,'' said Moseley, who earlier this season was cut by the Redskins in his 12th year with the team.\nDespite the constant din produced by 78,106 fans at Cleveland Stadium, this was often a dull game.\nAnd the Jets were seemingly in control with only 4:14 left while holding a commanding 10-point edge thanks to a 25-yard Freeman McNeil run. The score had been positioned by Jerry Holmes's interception. That was the second straight Browns drive that had ended with an interception. Earlier in the fourth quarter, Russell Carter became the first player to intercept Kosar after 133 straight passes. Kosar had not been intercepted the final three games of the regular season.\nWith McNeil's score, the Browns seemed finished. Kosar had a first and 20 after a penalty and was sacked by Marty Lyons. With second and 24, Kosar threw an incomplete pass, but Gastineau was called for a late hit. It kept alive the drive, on which Kosar completed 6 of 9 passes.\n''I've hit quarterbacks later than that and wasn't called,'' Gastineau said later.\nBut Kevin Mack completed that drive with a 1-yard touchdown run and with 1:57 remaining the Browns trailed by 3.\nBut McNeil was unable to run at peak performance at this point. On the previous drive he was poked in the eye, and this time the Jets held the ball for less than a minute. One of Dave Jennings's playoff-record 14 punts allowed the Browns to start from their 33.\nA penalty to Carl Howard, the Jets' cornerback, and a 37-yard completion to Webster Slaughter brought the Browns to the Jets' 15, from where Moseley sent the game into overtime with a 22-yard field goal with only seven seconds showing on the clock.\nIn the overtime, three Jet drives failed and O'Brien was sacked twice. Over all, he was dumped six times and Ryan three times.\nThe Jets won the toss, received the kick and were forced to punt. But on the Browns' first possession, they got to the Jets' 5-yard line. On first down, Schottenheimer didn't hesitate: He called on Moseley. But the kick was wide to the right.\nThe Browns started the winning drive on their 31. After the first 15-minute overtime period had expired, the teams changed sides, and the Browns started to run the ball with Mack. A Tired Defense\nBud Carson, the Jets' defensive coordinator, said his pass-rushers were simply too tired at that point and that he had to use lighter defensive backs to protect against Kosar's passes. So when Kosar handed Mack the ball, he was often running against smaller players.\nThe Browns ground it out, including runs of 4 yards by Mack, 8 yards by Mack, then Herman Fontenot for 7, Mack for 15, then 4, then 7 more. At the Jets' 9, on second down, Schottenheimer again called for Moseley. This one was true.\nThe end came 4 hours 5 minutes after the opening kickoff. The Jets' highlight had occurred hours earlier, when Ryan handed off to McNeil, who ran a few steps to the right, then lateraled back to Ryan, who found Wesley Walker in the end zone. That 42-yard score put the Jets on top, 7-0, but it did not diminish the Browns' enthusiasm.\nThey immediately produced a 98-yard march that ended with Fontenot snaring a 37-yard touchdown pass from Kosar.\nMoseley and Pat Leahy traded second-quarter field goals, but Leahy kicked a 37-yarder to put the Jets ahead by 13-10 in the third quarter. But when McNeil put the Jets ahead by 20-10 in the fourth period, very few people deserted the cavernous, old stadium. MCnEIL HELD IN CHECK\nMcNeil averaged only 2.8 yards a carry despite his 25-yard touchdown run, as 25 carries gained 71 yards. . . . Ryan was able to hold for Leahy on field-goal attempts even though he was unable to pass. Neither Ryan nor O'Brien threw an interception, and the Jets did not turn over the ball. . . . The Jets' secondary, meanwhile, was hampered by some new pass routes the Browns employed. Kosar's favorite receiver was the veteran tight end Ozzie Newsome, who caught 6 passes for 114 yards. Ten Cleveland receivers caught passes.

848	MONTANA USES MAGICAL TOUCH TO INSPIRE 49ERS TO NEW HIEGHTS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DB103BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: WHAT do you suppose his next trick might be, escaping from a straitjacket inside a locked truck falling to the floor of San Francisco Bay? Walking across the bay?\nWHAT do you suppose his next trick might be, escaping from a straitjacket inside a locked truck falling to the floor of San Francisco Bay? Walking across the bay?\nOr maybe it will be something more mundane, like leading the San Francisco 49ers to a victory over the Giants today in their National Conference divisional playoff game.\nWith everything else he has done, that would be routine. This is no ordinary Joe, don't forget. This is football's Man of the Year, medical division. Or maybe that should be miracle division. How many other players have returned to play seven weeks after back surgery? If the answer is as many as two, then ask yourself: How many defied his surgeon's warning that he would be ''crazy'' to resume his career, returned anyway and led his team to a division title with five victories in the last seven games?\nOnly one guy did that, of course: Joe Montana.\nThe miracle thing is tough to prove. Maybe it's even a little presumptuous. Still, it's almost spooky what happened this season in the eight games he has played - one before the operation and the last seven - as opposed to the eight in which his backups, Jeff Kemp and Mike Moroski, started. Besides winning more often with Montana, the 49ers scored more points, made more first downs, completed passes at a higher percentage, fumbled less, controlled the ball longer, allowed fewer points and intercepted more passes.\nEven Ray Wersching kicked his field-goal attempts more accurately in games Montana played. Not only that, opposing kickers were less accurate. Spooky. ''I know what you mean,'' said Keith Fahnhorst, the right tackle. You could almost hear the ''Twilight Zone'' theme song. ''Certain players make other players play at a higher level just by their presence. But I can't explain it better than that.''\n''He has an aura about him,'' said Mike Holmgren, the 49ers' quarterbacks coach. ''He seems to be one of those larger-than-life guys. When I go home, my little girls don't say, 'Hi, Daddy, how are you?' The first thing they want to know is, 'How's Joe?' My wife wants to know, too.''\nJust for the record, Montana's not buying it. The mere suggestion that he's any different from his 44 teammates makes him shake his head and laugh. ''Not me,'' he said the other day. ''We just started to play well toward the end of the year; I don't know what it was.''\nHe would sooner have you believe he's a regular Joe, no one special, just one of the guys, and off the field maybe he is. Shy and retiring, he seldom seeks the spotlight that inevitably finds him. Not that he's rude under its glare. To the contrary. He's polite, respectful, engaging, sometimes funny, but always self-effacing and modest.\nAnd now, perhaps a little more so. The operation shook him. ''I was scared to death,'' he said. He had good reason to be afraid. A team of doctors cut open his lower back to repair a herniated disk, after which there was speculation he might never play again. Even after his intensive rehabilitation, the chief surgeon who cleared him to return to the team, Dr. Arthur White of San Francisco, nonetheless offered his personal opinion that anyone who had the operation Montana had would be ''crazy'' to play football again.\nUndaunted, Montana returned in the 10th week of the season and completed 13 of 19 passes, 3 of them for touchdowns, in a 43-17 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. More important, he finished the game in one piece and with no pain.\nHe went on the lead the 49ers to the N.F.C. Western Division title with a masterly performance in the final game of the season, a 24-14 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in which he did a little surgery of his own, carving up the Rams with 23 completions for 238 yards and two touchdowns.\nHis line for 8 games: 307 passes, 191 completed (62.2 percent) for 2,236 yards, 8 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. Double everything, and it would have been his career high for attempts, completions, yards and interceptions. Not touchdowns.\nLooking back, Montana does not give himself a rave review for the season. ''When I came back,'' he said, ''it felt like I had sat out a year. Sometimes I thought I played well. Sometimes I didn't. I was disappointed that I wasn't quite as sharp as I had been. I missed a few easy throws; some were too easy. And I misread a few plays.''\nIt's that kind of assessment that endears Montana to many of those around him. Holmgren, who joined Bill Walsh's staff only this year, noted that Montana is ''one of the hardest-working guys'' he had ever seen. To those who know him longer, that's old news.\nIn the six seasons Montana has been the fulltime starter, he has helped the 49ers win more than 70 percent of their games, and that includes victories in two of the last five Super Bowls.\nBut it's more than Super Bowl victories, more than a great touchdown pass to Dwight Clark in the final moments of a conference championship game, more than the daring rollouts and all those completions that contribute to the sense of wonder some perceive in him. It's also the confidence he exudes, his quiet leadership.\n''He just knows how to handle himself,'' said Fahnhorst. ''He comes up with a play when you need it. You know you're always in a game with Joe Montana.''\nWersching touched on it the other day. In an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle, he said: ''It's what Joe creates when he's on the field, when he's on your side. It's that he has a charisma about him. He doesn't say anything. He lets his leadership role on the field express everything. With that, everybody else relaxes.''\nIncluding the kicker, apparently. In games Montana played, Wersching was good on 14 of 17 field-goal attempts. In the other 8, he was good on 11 of 18.\nWell, not all the 49ers are sold on the mystical approach. Even Fahnhorst recognized the dangers of abundant reliance on Montana. ''It's not like everbody waits around for him to do it,'' Fahnhorst said. ''That doesn't happen.''\nAnd it shouldn't, according to Russ Francis, the tight end.\n''It would be a mistake,'' he said, ''to try to manufacture a Joe Montana, a floating apparition over football, so that when anybody needs things to go right he would come to life and the magic would happen.''\nIn fact, he added, there is no magic involved at all: ''He can pick a defense apart by finding the third receiver in sequence. That's just knowing how to read the defense. It's not magic, and it's very tangible.'' Last year the Giants beat the 49ers, 17-3, in the N.F.C. wild-card game. Montana was beat up going in, with a sore shoulder, sore ribs, ''a little bit of everything,'' he said.\nThis time, he faces the Giants intact. No aches. No pains. And having endured 10 sacks and numerous hits over the last seven weeks of the season, he is only reminded of his back surgery when someone asks about it. ''I feel pretty good,'' he says softly. Maybe good enough to make the Giants disappear.
849	REDSKINS DETHRONE BEARS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DB103BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The Chicago Bears' season of success and turmoil came to a stunning end today, as the defending National Football League champions were beaten by the Washington Redskins in the divisional round of the playoffs.\nThe Chicago Bears' season of success and turmoil came to a stunning end today, as the defending National Football League champions were beaten by the Washington Redskins in the divisional round of the playoffs.\nThe 27-13 loss, shocking in light of the Bears' 14-2 regular season but not in light of their succession of quarterbacks, assures that for the seventh year in a row no team will win consecutive Super Bowls.\nAs victors, the Redskins, who were 12-4 in the regular season and 19-7 winners over the Los Angeles Rams in the National Conference wild-card game last Sunday, will play the winner of Sunday's game between the Giants or the San Francisco 49ers - in either case, on the home field of the winner.\n''I guess maybe my dreams didn't come true this year,'' Mike Ditka, the Bears' coach, said after reiterating some of the difficulties the Bears had today. They included two interceptions and two fumbles and a less than Bear-like defense.\n''It's a big disappointment to us,'' Ditka added. ''We've been plagued by turnovers all year. Today, we had some critical ones at the wrong time.''\nThe Redskins' victory was marked by the brilliant play of Jay Schroeder, who twice turned Bears blitzes into touchdowns; the solid second-half running of George Rogers, and the relentless play of the Washington defense, especially against the run.\nSchroeder, who completed 15 of 32 passes for 184 yards, was able to neutralize the Bears' famed pass rush with shorter drops, rollouts, quicker releases and, on the two touchdown passes, by finding the receiver - in both cases Art Monk - in single coverage.\nA 28-yard scoring pass to Monk in the first quarter gave the Redskins a 7-0 lead. A 23-yarder to him in the third quarter put them into the lead for good, 14-13.\nThe Redskins' other scores came on a 1-yard plunge by Rogers - just the fifth rushing touchdown the Bears yielded all season - and two field goals by Jess Atkinson, the former Giant who joined the Redskins before the last game of the regular season. Pass Defenses Thwarted\n''Going in, we felt the big thing was the pass blocking,'' said Schroeder, who was sacked just once. ''I knew if we could get single coverage, they couldn't cover us.''\nThe protection was all the more impressive in that two starting offensive linemen, Russ Grimm, a guard, and Joe Jacoby, a tackle, played with bothersome injuries from the Rams game. Grimm had a severely bruised rib cage; Jacoby a broken right hand.\nThe Redskins' defense, which played erratically over the season, had one of its best games, not only causing the turnovers but also befuddling Flutie with a good mix of man-to-man and zone coverage.\n''We had a great opportunity to go out there and do something, and I felt comfortable,'' said Flutie, who joined the Bears in midseason. ''The fact that I hadn't been here long had no effect on what happened. Things just weren't clicking.'' Payton Is Shut Down\nFlutie's moment of triumph was a 50-yard pass to Willie Gault that tied the score, 7-7, in the second period. By the end, he had completed just 11 of 31 passes for 134 yards.\nYet it was hardly just Flutie who caused the downfall of the champions. Walter Payton, the Bears' outstanding running back, was held to 38 yards on 14 carries.\nHe also lost the ball on a third-quarter fumble at the Washington 17-yard line, when the Bears were trailing, 14-13. The Redskins then drove 83 yards for their third touchdown.\nIf one play symbolized the frustrations of a season of change at quarterback (Jim McMahon, Mike Tomczak, Steve Fuller and Flutie) and periodic bickering between the players and Ditka, it was Payton's fumble. The Defense Was Solid\nTo that point, the Bears had done a reasonably solid job with their defense, despite the two touchdowns they had allowed. But give Schroeder credit for that. On the first, he watched Gary Fencik, the free safety, burst through the middle, leaving Monk only to beat Mike Richard. On the second, he caught Dave Duerson, the strong safety, and Wilber Marshall, the outside linebacker, leaving Monk again to beat only Richardson.\nBut on the next kickoff, Dennis Gentry ran the ball back 48 yards, giving the Bears a first down at the Washington 42. Neal Anderson ran for 11 yards. Calvin Thomas cut through the left side for 13 more. On the next play, Flutie handed off to Payton, who hit the left side.

The remaining 11 were Guineans, among them a nun and a military officer described as director general of cooperation.\nThe Government sent an air force transport plane to bring home the bodies of the Spanish victims today while the Ambassador to Equatorial Guinea traveled to the scene of the accident.\nThe death toll had originally been put at 18 by the Spanish Foreign Ministry and was revised to 15 this morning.\nThe accident occurred shortly after the twin-engine Aviocar took off from the mainland town of Bata on a routine flight to the Guinean capital of Malabo, 190 miles to the north on the island of Bioco, the Foreign Ministry said.\nThe plane failed to gain height and plunged into the sea.\nThe Foreign Ministry said the victims included the Mother Superior and deputy secretary of the Calasancia order, who had been visiting the order's missions over Christmas.\nThe others included three nuns and a priest of the Salesian order; the priest's sister, who had also been visiting over Christmas; a doctor, and the three crew members.

It asserted that a Libyan helicopter had been shot down at Fada.\nNeither communique reported on casualties.\nThe Libyan press agency denied that Libyan forces had staged air attacks and that a helicopter had been lost.\nChad reported Friday that it had retaken control of Zouar and Fada, but its officials said today that Zouar was not held definitively by either side.\nZouar was reportedly taken by the Libyans six days ago from Chadian rebels who were once their allies. It is a key point on the main track north to Libya.\nFada, about 175 miles southeast of the major outpost of Faya-Largeau, had been held by the Libyans for three years until Chadian Government forces reported capturing it Friday.\nThe Libyan Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi says it has no forces in Chad, but France and the United States say several thousand Libyan troops are in northern Chad.

But in most cities and towns along the Atlantic Seaboard, officials expressed relief that gray Atlantic waters had receded after lapping at the edge of neighborhoods.\nThe storm blanketed inland areas with up to two feet of snow.\n''We were fortunate that the worst didn't come true,'' said a spokesman for the National Weather Service in Boston, Charles Foley, who followed the storm that pummeled the South on New Year's Day as it blew north along the coasts of Maine and Nova Scotia yesterday. Winds of up to 70 miles an hour gusted out to sea, Mr. Foley said, and fought off rising tides that could have destroyed many more homes.\nThe storm dumped up to two feet of snow on most towns in central Massachusetts yesterday, the National Weather Service said, and sent tides up to five feet higher than normal at noon.\nA powerful northeaster that buffeted the East Coast and an unusual configuration of the Sun, Moon and Earth that pulled tides to exceptional heights together caused serious flooding, and forced evacuations in the southern and mid-Atlantic states earlier in the week. $16 Million Damage Toll By yesterday morning, however, power failures and flooded roadways that dotted eastern Massachusetts were under control, officials said. Despite some continuing flooding, they said, most of the 350 residents who had been evacuated from coastline towns south of Boston had returned home.\nThe storm caused $16 million in damage in the Carolinas and Virginia on New Year's Day and swept into the Northeast Friday. In the New York Metropolitan region, the storm swamped major roads, washed away a home in the Hamptons and flooded the ground floors of Fire Island houses.\nOn the West Coast, meanwhile, a Pacific Ocean storm pummeled the coasts of Oregon and Northern California with high winds and waves. In Oregon, gusts of more than 80 miles per hour hit Cape Blanco and 15- to 20-foot waves came ashore at Depoe Bay. Winter snow warnings went into effect in mountainous regions of northern California and Oregon, where up to 18 inches of snow were predicted.\nSnow continued to fall in New England and northern New York State well into the day, keeping many rural roads closed. In the town of Marcellus, N.Y., outside of Syracuse, the State Police said a Trailways bus carrying a group of skiers from Philadelphia overturned on a slippery road and was struck by two other vehicles early yesterday, killing a woman passenger and injuring the other 46 bus passengers. None of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening, the police said.\nSnow-covered roads were also blamed for two deaths in Vermont, one in New Jersey, one in Connecticut and another in Massachusetts.\nBut as the sun poked through clouds in the New York Metropolitan region in the early afternoon, the police on Long Island and New Jersey said that despite seas that made many beaches disappear, there were few reports of serious damage to property. Little Damage in Atlantic City\n''There has really been very little damage,'' said a police official in Atlantic City, the gambling resort on an island where roads were closed Friday.\nIn Maine, the storm dumped 10 to 24 inches of snow across the state, one of the heaviest snowfalls in a decade. Portland recorded a tide of 13.1 feet Friday, the third-highest since 1913.\nIn Massachusetts, the coastal town of Marshfield suffered the worst damage from the storm, officials said, when the tides breached a protective sea wall Friday and severely eroded some beaches. At the height of the storm, at noon Friday, the National Guard brought boats to rescue the 50 to 60 people clinging to the roofs of their flooded houses, said an officer of the State Civil Defense Agency, Jerry Meister.\nThroughout yesterday, police officers, civil defense officials and National Guardsmen monitored the winds and rising waters around Marshfield while people in town feverishly worked at rebuilding the damaged sea wall in time for the 2 P.M. high tide.\nNonetheless, the atmosphere in town was at times less one of an emergency than of a rare weekend spectacle.\n''Our main problems were the curiosity seekers who were watching the storm from the shore with the water pouring over their cars.'' said a Marshfield police spokesman, Barbara Skrycki, who said the town had no reports of fires, downed trees or medical problems. Some of the hundreds of people had refused to evacuate their homes and had watched the waters rise around their houses.\n''I'm from the old school, I don't get excited,'' said Dick Farley, 42 years old, who remained at home throughout the storm. ''As a matter of fact, my mother is on the front porch right now feeding the ducks.''\nAnd in the coastal town of Rye, N.H., while most people were digging out from more than a foot of snow, Bob Pletschke and Jim Soroka, two avid surfers from Conway, N.H., decided to take advantage of the unusual high tides by putting on their wetsuits and hitting the beach.\nThey joined a handful of other surfers who paddled 200 yards off shore to ride what turned out to be only modest waves. ''In the White mountains where I live, everybody is skiing today,'' Mr. Pletschke said. ''I like it better this way. It's not so crowded.''

If the Clippers, now 4-26, continue losing at their current pace, they will threaten the Philadelphia 76ers' 9-73 finish during the 1972-73 season, the worst in league history.\n''It was basically an easy victory for us,'' said Mike Gminski, the Nets' center, who turned in a 17-point, 10-rebound performance. ''We need games like that.''\nThe Nets piled up a 20-2 lead in the opening four and a half minutes of the game. While Gminski was scoring 7 points and Buck Williams 5 of his 15, the Clippers' only score in their first nine attempts was a turnaround jumper 1 minute 29 seconds into the game by Benoit Benjamin, their 7-foot second-year center.\n''They were not getting back on defense,'' said Gminski. ''When a team falls behind by 10 points or so so early like they did tonight, teams tend to panic. They began to take wild shots and when they miss and we controlled the boards, the lead just began to snowball.''\nThe victory, the Nets' easiest of the season, made their record 9-21.\nIn losing their 11th straight game to a team with a sub-.500 record, the Clippers never recuperated from that disastrous start. The Nets led by 32-20 at the quarter and 59-42 at halftime.\nThe Clippers, who own the worst shooting percentage in the league (.455), shot 35 percent in the game.\nMeanwhile, the Nets, led by Tony Brown's 22 points, shot 52 percent from the field and outrebounded the Clippers, 69-38.\nDon Chaney, the Clippers' coach, calling the performance ''the worst of the season,'' said he saw little help and few victories in the future. ''It's going to be difficult for us to win 10 games,'' said Chaney.\nAlthough the Clippers started the season without Norm Nixon, the playmaker who suffered a torn tendon in his left knee in an offseason softball game in Central Park, they were once 3-3. But their problems began to mount in the ninth game of the season against the Dallas Mavericks when Marques Johnson, their leading scorer, was lost for the season when he suffered a serious back injury in a collision with Benjamin.\nMike Woodson, the former Knick who had a 2-for-15 shooting night, called it ''a frustrating night that put an end to a frustrating day.''\n''It took us almost 10 hours to get here from Indianapolis,'' said Woodson, alluding to mechanical problems on the team's flight.\nPRO BASKETBALL

The times when their lack of talent and inability to mesh as a team usually resulted in embarrassing, lopsided defeats were almost forgotten.\nThroughout their recent resurgence, it became difficult to recall just how atrocious the Knicks once were. The times when their lack of talent and inability to mesh as a team usually resulted in embarrassing, lopsided defeats were almost forgotten.\nTonight, however, the Knicks provided a grim reminder of those times. ''It seemed like we went back to our old selves,'' said Gerald Wilkins.\nAnd it wasn't a pleasant return. The Knicks' 114-92 thrashing tonight at the hands of the young, surging Hawks was not their worst defeat of the season. But it was among the most surprising because it came at a time when they were playing their best basketball of the season. That, and the resulting four-game winning streak, ended with a careless and unenthusiastic exhibition.\nThe Knicks committed a season-high 26 turnovers, played ineffectively at both ends of the court and trailed by as many as 30 points en route to their 22d defeat in 31 games. The Knicks road record fell to 2-15. The Hawks raised their record to 22-7, best in the Eastern Conference.\nIt was an evening when there was little to praise. Patrick Ewing opened the contest with 12 first-period points, but finished with only 16, and Wilkins provided the sellout crowd of 16,522 fans with the only excitement by the opposition with 20 points.\nBut Bill Cartwright (1 for 6 from the floor, 9 points and a season-high 7 turnovers), Gerald Henderson (4 for 11), Pat Cummings (5 fouls in 5 minutes) all suffered what were among their worst performances of the season.\nConversely, pratically any player the Hawks' coach, Mike Fratello, summoned onto the court contributed to the rout. All 12 Atlanta players scored, and eight managed double-figures. Dominique Wilkins led the Hawks scorers with 21 points, 15 in the first period.\n''I don't think there was anything we could have done,'' said Bob Hill, the Knicks coach. ''It was just one of those nights.''\nIt was indeed a night when the challenge was lost soon after it had begun. The Hawks, with weapons as varied and potent as any team, opened the assault with Wilkins. Last year's scoring champion started with a soft-jumper from the baseline. Then he drew a foul on a drive, and followed with a 3-pointer that touched nothing but net.\nBy the end of the first period, Wilkins had 15 points and the Hawks led by 37-26.\n''Dominique really ignites their team,'' said Trent Tucker. ''You can see that when he does something explosive on the offensive end, the whole team gets a lift.''\nEight different Hawks scored in the second period, and from everywhere on the floor. Little-known and little-used players such as Antoine Carr (8 points) and John Battle (10 points) took advantage of the widening scoring gap to pad their statistics, while starters such as Randy Wittman (15 points), Glenn Rivers (10 points) and Wayne Rollins (10 points 16 rebounds) managed their share.\n''Every guy that came off the bench was scoring points and we just couldn't get going,'' said Gerald Wilkins. ''They were running down our throats.''\nThe most discouraging news is that the Knicks face the Hawks again on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden. ''I told them to keep their chins up,'' Hill said of his post-game talk. ''We'll make some adjustments and see what happens.'' PRO BASKETBALL

Instead, they chug impassively along, squeeze the competition's forays off toward the boards and vary their methods of attack.\nIn the course of beating the Islanders, 5-4, tonight at Nassau Coliseum, they alternately used velocity, with seven hard shots in the first, and frequency, outshooting their hosts by 15-7 in the second, and ambush, scoring their fourth goal 25 seconds into the final period.\nThen, after third-period goals from Mike Bossy and Brent Sutter in the space of a giddy 35 seconds made the score 4-4, the Bruins spoiled the comeback with a power-play goal from Tom McCarthy at 13:42.\n''We really wanted to win this one rather than blow it,'' said Denis Potvin, who was called for the interference penalty that preceded McCarthy's goal. ''I totally killed our momentum when I got that penalty.''\nOn a night the Islanders had dedicated to breaking out of a slump that had them 0-3-1 in the four games before tonight's, they played their way into their longest drought without a victory since January 1984.\n''We played just well enough to lose this,'' said Coach Terry Simpson.\nIn the first period, the Islanders, who had chided themselves for sluggish starts in their last six games, struck quickly. After only 26 seconds, Bryan Trottier's wrist shot bounced sideways off Doug Keans's pads, and Trottier poked his rebound inside the right post.\nThe Bruins blasted their way to a 1-1 tie on their third shot, courtesy of Ray Bourque's power-play slapshot at 8:54.\nBossy, whose sore back has curtailed his production, snapped a shot by Keans at 1:24 of the second period. But with the Bruins applying some clever strategy on the power play two minutes later, Charlie Simmer sneaked in behind Kelly Hrudey and put Rick Middleton's pass into the open net at 3:40. The 2-2 tie was broken when Makela, under pressure in his zone, misplayed the puck by sending it onto the stick of Steve Kasper, who scored from deep in the slot at 11:38.\nThe Islanders' two-goal comeback in the third period was flashy but unavailing, as it took the Bruins just over a minute to reassert themselves. Searching for inspired players, the Islanders' general manager, Bill Torrey, and Simpson have lately traveled to watch their minor-league affiliate in Springfield, but they haven't found the caliber of help they need there.\nHOCKEY
864	FROESE STEALS SHOW IN RANGER VICTORY	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DE113BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Just 1 minute 33 seconds into the game, Bobby Carpenter made his first appearance as a Ranger. He skated into the faceoff circle with Peter Stastny and he won the faceoff. Phil Esposito's newest, biggest star was officially in place.\nJust 1 minute 33 seconds into the game, Bobby Carpenter made his first appearance as a Ranger. He skated into the faceoff circle with Peter Stastny and he won the faceoff. Phil Esposito's newest, biggest star was officially in place.\nThat done, another of the new-name Rangers, Bob Froese, stole all the drama. He gave, in short, the most memorable goaltending performance for the Rangers this season.\nFroese stopped 39 shots and when he was not sliding to his knees to stop a puck, he was taking it in the chin -literally. In the third period, a shot caught him square, he rested for a moment, and then continued slipping and sliding and the Rangers finished off their 5-2 victory over the Quebec Nordiques.\n''I can't get over how well he positions himself,'' said Ed Giacomin, a Ranger assistant coach. ''It's clear he's been well taught, and its unbelievable considering he doesn't know his defensemen yet.'' Two Goals for Jensen\nChris Jensen scored twice and Don Maloney assisted on all five goals to help bring the Rangers their third straight victory - a first this season - and their fifth in six games.\nThrough a long day of travel and practice, it was all Esposito could do to stop smiling. A few rows behind him on the chartered prop plane that brought the team here this morning Carpenter sat next to Froese. Two weeks ago, neither player was with the team, so they clearly represented the changed face of the Rangers.\nIn less than six months as general manager, Esposito has made several trades that have supplied dividends, he has changed coaches and when he has had a few moments, he has substituted as coach while Tom Webster recovers from ear surgery. When he was asked today what other changes he had contemplated, he said he had thought about coming back to play himself. He is a kidder, but when he said this he was only half-jolking.\n''I thought that maybe I could just go out for faceoffs,'' he said.\nSome would say that it was only a matter of time before it would come to this, that Esposito, 45 years old and six years past his retirement, would try to keep extending his reach. But Esposito has ruminated over this strange thought not because he has lost possession of his ability to think right, nor because he is the ultimate ham. It is merely another sign that there is nothing too far-fetched for Esposito to consider.\nTonight, the early attention was on Carpenter, who skated alongside Mark Osborne and Pierre Larouche most of the night. He played in workmanlike fashion, but he had not played since Nov. 22, so he skated in short shifts.\n''I played it smart,'' Carpenter said. ''I've got a long way to go before I'll feel completely comfortable.''\nSo the focus shifted to Froese, who was all show business and surprise -diving, kicking, stubbornly holding off the Nordiques in one of the most brilliant displays in the net that any Ranger goalie has had this season.\nWhen the Rangers acquired Froese from Philadelphia, it might have been with the notion that they could use him as fodder for a future trade. But after his first four games for the Rangers with a 3-1 record, that notion has been dismissed.\nFroese made 14 above-average to improbable saves in the first two periods. He was particularly tough on Brent Ashton, stopping three point-blank shots. And with 7:51 left in the second he made the most memorable of all, a sliding save on a shot from Peter Stastny.\nIn all, he faced 32 shots in the first and second periods while the Rangers had just 14. Still, he had a 3-1 lead after two periods because the Rangers' few shots were usually blistering and they baffled the Nordiques' goalie, Mario Gosselin.\n''The amazing thing is I'm not getting tired,'' Froese said. ''Phil has put adrenalin in everyone and it's really helping me.''\nAnd the players who charged up the offense, such as Jensen and Maloney, gave credence to Esposito's theory that he had players to take the place of Mike Ridley and Kelly Miller, whom he traded away for Carpenter.\nJensen scored the first goal of the night at 9:17 of the first. Jeff Brown tied it for Quebec at 15:48. In the second period, Larouche scored after 39 seconds and Jensen with a long, high slap shot, scored with 1:35 left in the period. Ron Greschner's goal at 5:07 of the third gave the Rangers a three-goal lead.\nHOCKEY

''We found one for them.'' The night before, the Lions used an ever-changing series of defensive coverages and ball-jarring tackling to distract, frustrate and overcome the previously top-ranked University of Miami and Vinny Testaverde in the Fiesta Bowl. The scoreboard said 14-10. The glaring statistics wondered how.\nPenn State was outgained, 445 yards to 162, a margin of nearly 3 to 1. Miami held the ball 7 minutes 26 seconds longer and ran 93 offensive plays to Penn State's 59.\nBut more subtle figures reflected some of the methods the resourceful Lions employed to steal a game and earn the No. 1 ranking today in both news-agency polls. ''The things that win big games are not what you do on first and second down,'' Paterno said, ''and they're not necessarily what you do in your own territory.''\nJohn Bruno, the Lion senior, punted nine times for an average of 43.4 yards. Even more significant was the fact that Bruno's work forced Miami to begin inside its 25-yard line six times and never farther than the Hurricane 37. The Lion kickoff coverage restricted Miami to its 25, 15 and 20.\nMiami converted on 6 of 22 third-down plays, a 27.3 percent rate that was 12.6 below its level throughout the 11 Hurricane victories. When added to seven turnovers, nine penalties and at least six dropped passes, the picture becomes clearer. Testaverde, intercepted nine times all season, was picked off five times Friday night.\n''This is the greatest game in Penn State history,'' said Trey Bauer, the seldom understated linebacker who was part of 12 tackles.\n''It ranks up there with one or two,'' said John Shaffer, the maligned Lion quarterback who completed just 5 of 16 passes for 53 yards - 232 fewer than Testaverde - but ran for a 4-yard touchdown and made several correct decisions at crucial times.\n''We beat them the only way we could beat them,'' Paterno said. ''We beat them in certain situations. We spent hours and hours on playing those situations.''\nThe problems created by Miami's poor field position were compounded by a defensive scheme developed since late last November. The plan of Jerry Sandusky, the linebacker coach, depended on a consistent three-man rush against a reshaped and healing offensive line; a steady three-man deep zone that defied Miami to throw long and quickly converged to punish the Hurricanes for shorter receptions; a variety of blitzes to make Testaverde think; plus the frequent and surprising insertion of Keith Karpinski, Shane Conlan's replacement, as an extra linebacker.\nWhat could give Linebacker U. a chance? What else? More linebackers. The six-week wait that appeared to have eroded the intricate Miami passing game gave the Lions time to create and think. Conlan, who played most of the night with a reinjured left knee that made him walk stiff-legged this morning, was freed for an occasional rush. He sometimes played as a middle linebacker, and other times as a strong safety. His two interceptions doubled his career total. Ray Isom, the 5-foot-9-inch safety whose fierce, fumble-making jolt of Mike Irvin set the pace on Miami's second possession, said there had been 24 coverages.\nPenn State's success caused the politics surrounding the nation's obsession with No. 1 to be reduced to one play: Pete Giftopoulos's interception at the Penn State 1-yard line to end Miami's frantic 71-yard drive with nine seconds to go. Two days of Penn State practices had been spent on last-minute situations, giving the experienced Lions the presence of mind to make the switches that confounded Miami and took a championship out of the pollsters' hands.\nPenn State was No. 1 and Miami No. 2 in both The Associated Press poll of sportswriters and broadcasters and the United Press International poll of coaches. The New York Times computer ranking assigned Oklahoma (11-1) the No. 1 position despite the Penn State victory. The .028 difference in the two teams was based primarily on Oklahoma's average margin of victory of 35.8 points, as opposed to Penn State's 17.5.\nPaterno said he had never seen Sandusky as emotional as his assistant of 18 seasons became Friday night.\n''It was disbelief, really, that we did it,'' Sandusky remembered. ''This was just so special because of the people that were involved. Three years ago, they floundered and flopped, and it was the same people that did it all last night. To have a feeling for what it takes, and seeing people believe in that and have the courage and strength to do it, and then have it work, it means so much.'' COLLEGE FOOTBALL

Scientists said it would take them back 600 million years in geologic time and could help in oil exploration, mineral and rare earth discoveries, the burial of hazardous waste, understanding of earthquakes and the monitoring of nuclear tests.\nThe proposal is one of four under scientific evaluation, says the sponsor of the conference, a nonprofit corporation in Washington called Deep Observation and Sampling of the Earth's Continental Crust Inc. - or Dosecc, as it calls itself.

870	DECEMBER NOT COLD ENOUGH? BE PATIENT, AN EXPERT ADVISES	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDB113BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THOSE who swear that winters were colder and blustier and Christmases whiter when they were young are usually not right, according to meteorologists and climatologits in New Jersey.\nTHOSE who swear that winters were colder and blustier and Christmases whiter when they were young are usually not right, according to meteorologists and climatologits in New Jersey.\n''These observations are anecdotal and based on mistaken recollections,'' said Mark D. Shulman, the head of meteorology and physical oceanography at Rutgers University's Cook College. ''People who remember snow up to their chins when they were kids forget that they were only two or three feet tall at the time.''\nNevertheless, the experts say, it is true that New Jersey, even though small, has varied weather, attributable to differences in latitude, topography and environment, urban or rural.\nAs a study by the National Weather Service showed several years ago, New Jersey, like the rest of the northern hemisphere, has been warming up ever so slightly in recent decades. However, Dr. Shulman and others said the temperature rise was minuscule - a fraction of a degree celsius over three decades.\nStill, the state probably is just as cold this month as when grandma was a girl.\nKeith R. Arneson, a meteorologist at Rutgers, said in a recent interview last week that the average December temperature in the central part of the state had been running slightly above the annual average of 34 degrees, as well as being slightly warmer to the north and colder to the south.\nPeople who now live in a different part of the state than they did when they were children, or those who live in cities where heavy industry has increased over the decades, could be more accurate about getting less snow.\nEugene Hathaway, a weather specialist for the National Weather Service at Newark International Airport, explained that warm industrial stack emissions, as well as concrete and pavement, tended to raise temperatures in cities such as Newark and Jersey City.\nUpon reaching the low atmosphere, Mr. Hathaway said, the snow turns to sleet or rain. Sometimes, he said, chemical pollution hanging over the cities can break up entire cloud masses so that snow may fall in the far western part of Essex County and not in Newark or adjacent Belleville.\nMr. Hathaway and Dr. Shulman noted separately that there were significant differences in temperature and snowfall in the southern and northern parts of the state because of simple contrasts in latitude and topography.\nIn Sussex County, for example, higher altitude can account for temperatures 10 degrees colder than, say, in New Brunswick.\nSussex and the entire northwestern part of the state receive an average of 45 inches of snow each year. The central part receives 25 to 30 inches, and Cape May and Cumberland Counties get 15 inches.\nSome of the confusion about the wide variations in temperature and precipitation can be laid to weather forecasts and individual reports, Dr. Shulman said.\nAlthough there can be great variations from even one town to another, he said, some of the differences arise from inaccuracy. The only two official weather stations in the state, he noted, are in Newark and Atlantic City (the Weather Service in Philadelphia forecasts for those parts of southern New Jersey not covered by Atlantic City).\nLocal temperature and precipitation readings taken outside these official weather stations often can be amiss, Dr. Shulman said.\nFor example, he said, some inaccuracies come from the Weather Channel, a regional cable-television station that relies on local cable companies to take the average temperatures that are reported as ''local temperatures.''\n''The Weather Channel,'' Dr. Shulman said, ''invested millions of dollars in instruments for these local stations, and it probably was a big mistake. They are very inaccurate because quality control is impossible.''\nMr. Hathaway said that the National Weather Service and the Weather Channel relied on laymen or ''contract observers,'' who run ''cooperative'' weather stations.\nTo get accurate readings, he said, thermometers and rain gauges at these unofficial stations are supposed to be placed 100 feet from the nearest building or obstruction, six feet from the ground over a nonpaved grass surface and facing north.\nIn one instance, Mr. Hathaway said, the Weather Service discovered that a contract observer in the north had placed his instruments 12 inches from the outside of a building, 18 inches from an indoor exhaust port that was emitting warm air and facing south.\n''We sometimes find that there are substantial differences in temperature, or in rain or snow, between two observers who live a few blocks from each other,'' he said.\nAs for white Christmases, Mr. Hathaway said there had been less than an inch to 2.9 inches of snow on Christmas Day in 1950, 1951, 1962, 1966 and 1976. The largest snowfall during the holidays, he said, occurred on Dec. 26, 27 and 28 in 1947, when there was a total of 25.6 inches.\nAnd those who believe December was not cold enough, Dr. Shulman says, should be patient; January, with an average temperature of 30 degrees, is the coldest month in New Jersey.

Close the poor schools and bus the students to the good schools.\nWhy wait 5 or 10 years to save the children when instant salvation is available a few miles down the road by bus?\nNewark students could go to Columbia High School in Maplewood and to Millburn High, Plainfield students could attend Westfield, New Brunswick students would go to Highland Park and Edison, and Asbury Park students would attend Deal, etc., etc.\nIf Trenton does not accept this obvious solution, and if Westfield, Millburn and Edison are less than enthusiastic about accepting inner-city students, perhaps the problems in urban schools are more complex than Trenton realizes, and changing administrators will have less effect on education in the cities than on the porcine educational bureaucracy in Trenton.\nWho will fill these vacant, lucrative administrative positions created by the inquisition? Not bright young students with degrees in technical disciplines, in business and in the liberal arts.\nThey recognize teaching as a pseudo profession. They are intelligent enough to stay out of it. They go where they can be creative, innovative, appreciated and compensated.\nSuccessful, tenured administrators secure in a serene and tranquil suburban environment who are waiting to retire, or to advance into positions soon to be vacated by an aging staff, are content with their ''bird in the hand.''\nBy default, we are left with the dropouts from industry, ''the alternate methods'' who have decided to try teaching for a year or two to see what it's like.\nThey will listen to Trenton and do as they are told . . . and if everything is not perfect in this best of all possible educational worlds, they will return to their first love, industry, and the poor schools will still be with us.\nIf, after five years, the poor schools remain poor, the fault cannot be attributed to the ordained supervisors. The failure will result from the inability of the annointed to rid the system of the tenured heretics.\nIn this case, we must cancel tenure, purge education of the heretics, replace them with the faithful and appoint a commissioner for life with absolute power to save the children, and the problems in New Jersey education will be solved forever and ever.

Its 27,268 remaining residents must now leave the United Nations-supervised camp, which appeared in the film ''The Killing Fields.'' For most of those still at Khao I Dang, hope of resettlement in the West was dashed. Reclassified as ''displaced persons'' to be eventually returned to Cambodia, they will be sent to camps run by resistance groups.\nThailand had been trying to close Khao I Dang for months but delayed while waiting in vain for the West to take more of the refugees from its Vietnam-dominated neighbors. Most of those remaining lack family connections abroad and suitable work skills or are suspected of ties to the Khmer Rouge, which ruled Cambodia in a reign of terror in the late 1970's. The State Department said it was concerned about the closing.\nPrasong Soonsiri, secretary general to the Thai Prime Minister, said 120,620 Cambodians, Laotians and Vietnamese who had been counted as refugees remained in Thailand, including tens of thousands of children born in the camps. More than 500,000 have been resettled abroad and 44,000 sent home, he said, ''voluntarily.''

The Archbishop of New York had been invited to Israel by Shimon Peres, who was then Prime Minister, but after a telephone call from a Vatican representative, he canceled plans to meet top Israeli leaders in their Jerusalem offices.\nThe Cardinal said he had ''made a mistake'' and ''failed to be sufficiently thorough in my preparations.''

Although that was not the explicit aim behind last week's unsuccessful talks on the return of $500 million in Iranian assets held in the United States, the hostages seemed to be on everyone's mind.\nThe Iranians have said that if Washington returns its money, the amount they overpaid in a 1981 deal to retire some bank loans plus interest, they might be inclined to use their leverage with militants in Lebanon. Although the United States is ''not willing to negotiate with that as our objective,'' Abraham D. Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser, said, it ''will be grateful'' for the return of the five Americans now held hostage.\nBoth countries said that progress was made in the talks at The Hague last week. But the Iranians accused the United States of not dealing in ''good faith'' after American representatives postponed the next session. Late in the week, the Iranian Prime Minister, Mir Hussein Moussavi, reportedly denied any link between the money and the hostages.\nThe Administration recognizes that the money belongs to Iran. But, some critics argue, with the furor over the Iran arms sale still simmering, it is in no rush to hand it over, lest the impression be given that it is giving in to Teheran.\nTHE WORLD

Moores, assistant to the regional director of the Department of Transportation, said inspectors had found that several of the hangers that carry the weight of the deck beams had deteriorated and ''could have created a failure in the deck system that possibly could have had a domino effect.'' He said he could not speculate on what could happen, but one possibility is that a heavily loaded truck could fall through the deck into the water.\nThe bridge was built in 1904 and is 330 feet long. A few years ago, the state posted the bridge with a 20-ton limit because ''over time, steel deteriorates'' and cannot carry either the load it was designed for or the heavier loads of today's traffic, Mr. Moores said.\nThe department discovered the flaws when the engineers made a special inspection of all posted bridges in anticipation of heavy loads of sand and salt they would carry during the winter.\nA bid was awarded in December to Felix Industries of Lincolndale to build a new two-lane span next to Woods Bridge by the end of this year. Traffic would then be switched to the new span, Woods Bridge would be demolished and another two-lane span would be built in its place. The new bridge had been planned partly because of the move of Pepsico and International Business Machines to Somers.\nPepsico is scheduled to open in the spring, with about 1,500 employees and 1,200 cars added to traffic each day, and I.B.M. is scheduled to open late next year.\nMr. Moores said the engineers were still deciding last week whether to reinforce the hangers with cables or structural steel. The work will be done by state employees and should be completed within a couple of weeks, he said.\nSupervisor D. Wayne Van Tassell of Somers said that because Somers is bounded on the east by reservoirs, the detours all involve bridges. Travelers between Somers and Katonah will now have to go north to the Route 138 bridge or south to Pines Bridge over on Route 100. Both are modern four-lane bridges capable of carrying additional traffic, Mr. Moores said.\nMr. Van Tassel said traffic ''was not too bad'' after the bridge closed because it was light over the Christmas holiday. If the bridge is repaired as planned, it will be back in service well before the new influx of traffic.\nWESTCHESTER JOURNALL

Experts surmised that importers had been racing against the Dec. 1 effective date for a new Customs Service fee.\nStill, while saying the numbers were not as bad as they looked, many economists were taken aback. Stuart A. Schweitzer, a vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said the data ''raise questions about whether the trade accounts have turned around, as seemed to be the case by earlier figures.''\nAnalysts also attributed some acceleration in imports to nervousness about calls for trade restrictions -which, in turn, are rising with the deficit. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the new Majority Leader, urged trade legislation ''that will restore jobs and halt the erosion of our industrial base.''\nPartly in response to such pressures, the Administration announced that it was ending duty-free access on more than $3 billion in imports from developing nations including Taiwan and South Korea.\nIn addition, the White House promised a 200 percent tariff on many European goods if the European Community does not offset American farmers' loss of Spain as a major grain market. Also last week, under pressure from the Administration, Canada agreed to impose a 15 percent export tax on lumber.\nIf bad news on the trade deficit was largely discounted, so was the apparent good news in the index of leading economic indicators for November. The rise was 1.2 percent, the biggest since April. It was widely believed, however, that demand was spurred by changes in the tax law and that the November increase did not signal significant growth.\nTHE NATION

Losses were $245 million for the first nine months of 1986 and may have topped $300 million for the year.\nPeople's fast takeoff and bumpy landing coincided with Federal deregulation of airlines. Beginning as a small operation in an old terminal at Newark International Airport, People's grew fast - too fast, conceded Donald C. Burr, the line's founder and chairman. By 1985, it had gone deeply into debt and owed $60.5 million in annual interest - far more than operating income. Established airlines matched People's low fares, luring away passengers as well as personnel who worked for low pay and a share of profits that dwindled and disappeared. .\nThe buyer, Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Houston-based Texas Air, now heads the country's largest airline holding company. His company bought Eastern Airlines and part of Frontier earlier last year and also owns Continental and New York Air.\nSecurities analysts disagreed as to how these and other airline mergers would affect fares and service. Some said discount fares would be fewer and that some sizable cities might soon be served by only a single airline. Other analysts believe the remaining large airlines will square off, using lower-paid employees and efficient new planes and equipment to put pressure on prices.\nTHE NATION

Weingarten, the County Democratic Party chairman, said last week. ''Because Westchester recommends, does not mean the Governor will accept.'' Asked about grumblings among the county's Democratic leaders that Governor Cuomo has ignored their recommendations in the past, Mr. Weingarten replied: ''For the most part, he has listened. The Governor's agenda is just different from mine.''\nAcknowledging that the Governor ''thinks the recommendations of party chairmen are suspect,'' Mr. Weingarten said: ''We do judge people in a different context as the professional lawyers that we are. I think we have as much competence as judges, but Governor Cuomo chooses to listen more to the Office of Court Administration than he does to us.'' The office is the administrative and management agency for the state's courts. Although Mr. Weingarten conceded that the office does not have any official role in selecting nominees for judicial appointment, he said the Governor depends on the chief officers of that agency for advice.\nMr. Weingarten described merit selection as ''hogwash and the height of absurdity'' and said, ''You can't select a judge by an exam.'' If the two people recommended by the county's Democrats are found qualified by the Governor's judicial-screening committee, however, Mr. Weingarten said he was confident that the Governor would appoint them to the posts. A decision from the Governor is expected in about a month.\nWESTCHESTER JOURNAL

He astonished the membership by warning them that the country was facing maximum danger, a war from the Far East.'' Mr. Cherne was mocked for his forecast, Mr. Flanagan said, ''by almost every respected publication in the country -until Dec. 7, 1941.''\nAnd Mr. Cherne has been right on target with his forecasts ever since, according to Mr. Flanagan.

The Governor said, ''We can aim higher.''\nThere were some signs last week that Mr. Cuomo might have decided to aim a bit higher himself. In an interview the day before he was sworn in, he said he would soon begin a series of trips around the country, a disclosure taken by some as a signal that Mr. Cuomo was on the verge of seeking the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination.\nIn the meantime, however, there remained some bread-and-butter issues, such as a matter of milk, to be dealt with at home. A day after the pomp and cannonades that began the Governor's second term, aides announced the resignation of the state Agriculture Commissioner, Joseph Gerace. The aides said he was told that it would be a far better thing for him to go than to stay.\nThe Cuomo administration had been at odds with Mr. Gerace since the Commissioner's decision in December not to allow more milk distributors to operate throughout New York City. The Governor, aiming for lower milk prices through increased competition, had sought to expand the number of dairies with citywide licenses, which are currently held by only five dairies, all in New York State.\nMr. Gerace's ruling not to grant a New Jersey dairy a citywide license brought cries of outrage from consumer groups. Daniel Oliver, the Federal Trade Commission chairman, criticized him for favoring ''an anti-consumer monopoly.'' THE REGION

887	WORKS BY SIBELIUS THAT AREN'T IN THE STANDARD REPERTORY	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF1E3BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Critics have an inherent distrust of geniuses who take afternoons off, and the artist who produces a high quantity of dross along with the occasional masterpiece is automatically suspect. Sibelius produced a vast quantity of less than notable piano music, most of it charitably ignored while his famous symphonies perpetuate his fame.\nCritics have an inherent distrust of geniuses who take afternoons off, and the artist who produces a high quantity of dross along with the occasional masterpiece is automatically suspect. Sibelius produced a vast quantity of less than notable piano music, most of it charitably ignored while his famous symphonies perpetuate his fame. Verdi is forgiven the sporadic excess of his early works because we hear in them the genesis of the late masterpieces. And presto! Verdi's career becomes an object lesson in the education of a composer - a comfortable pattern, easy to chart and to justify.\nRichard Strauss was once cited as a genius who ''burned out,'' who began brilliantly with the early tone poems and operas, and then repeated himself endlessly, with diminishing effect, for the rest of his career. Another comfortable pattern - the dissolution of a talent - and critics have found it easy to rely upon.\nBut the truth, as usual, was more complex. As we came to know the radiant last works of Strauss, with their serenity and nostalgia, we charted the Strauss career rather differently. It was now said that the composer hit a slump and then, miraculously, recovered: ''What cleared his gaze?'' begins George Marek's summary of the late years in his popular biography. Today, many listeners have discovered that the middle works of Strauss have a fascination all their own. They are less even than the early and late works, perhaps, but still occasionally hit home.\nSo what to make of Sibelius? Here is a man who produced masterpieces and kitsch, cheek by jowl, for some 30 years, and then stopped composing altogether. Along with the tone poems and symphonies - at least four of the latter of which would make most lists of 20th-century masterworks - exist a vast quantity of songs, chamber music, piano compositions, and so on. The familiar String Quartet ''Voces Intimae'' has entered the repertory, as have a few of the songs. But most of Sibelius's nonorchestral music is a mystery to the general public.\nIs this fair? Well, yes and no. The piano music - more than 100 compositions, almost all of them less than five minutes in duration - is, for the most part, shockingly bad. And not the sort of ''so-bad-it's-great'' that brings us pleasure in an Edward G. Wood film or in a Florence Foster Jenkins record. These pieces are not only bad, but uninteresting: conventional, late romantic intermezzo pieces without character or individuality, along the lines of the ''Album Leaves'' that used to fill early 20th century piano anthologies - Ethelbert Nevin without the tunes.\nStill, a few of the piano pieces have some distinction. Glenn Gould admired the three Sonatinas, which have just been recorded by Erik J. Tawastsjerna, a pianist and the son of Sibelius's biographer. To Gould, these works had the same ''spartan concision, bordering on the singy, that is found in the symphonies, but their idiom is almost neo-Classical.'' And a lovely little Romance in D-flat once attained some fame (a classic recording by Eileen Joyce is still available on Finlandia 003).\nThose who have a fancy for this unassuming mood music might investigate the two recent releases: Mr. Tawaststjerna has recorded the Sonatinas on BIS 196 and some miniatures on BIS 230, while the first recordings of these works, made by the late Cyril Szalkiewicz in the 1950's, have been reissued on two Finlandia recordings (FA 802, 804). Mr. Tawaststjerna plays well and has superior sonics, while Mr. Szalkiewicz's performances have the seal of approval directly from the composer, who heard and encouraged the young man.\nSibelius's music for violin and piano is equally unassuming, but rather more likable. It is hard to reconcile these romances and caprices with the masterly Violin Concerto, but they are beguiling in their own way - Northern ''potted palm'' music - and a recording by the violinist Yuval Yaron and the pianist Rena Stipelman on Finlandia 301 is characterized by a sweet tone and direct simplicity.\nThe Sibelius songs, of course, are quite another story. This is a major body of work, and many of them are wonderfully concise and dramatic. A few are regularly heard in concert; the reason more are not in the repertory is not due to any faults in the music but instead, most likely, to the unfamiliarity of the Finnish and Swedish languages.\nIn any event, the songs have been admirably served on disk in recent years, most notably by the superb baritone Jorma Hynninen. Two of his recitals of Sibelius songs are now available: a two-record set, issued on Finlandia in 1980 (FA 202) and an earlier one, recorded in 1975, but only now generally available in this country (Harmonia Mundi France, HMC 5142). The early record can be recommended only to those who want to experience embryonic versions of the masterful product Hynninen would later produce. His voice was already beautiful, but his interpretations do not have the incision and immediacy we find on the later record.\nThe complete songs have now been recorded for Argo, by the baritone Tom Krause, the soprano Elisabeth Soderstrom, the pianists Irwin Gage and Vladimir Ashkenazy, and the guitarist Carlos Bonell. It's largely Mr. Krause's show; Miss Soderstrom sings with power and artistry, but she only has about a dozen songs, and her voice is not what it was. Mr. Krause is as fine as this listener has ever heard him, delivering performances that are straightforward but with no lack of subtlety, befitting the combination of folkish simplicity and self-conscious artistry that we find in the songs. (Argo 411-739-1, five disks).\nWe have mentioned the one mature quartet from Sibelius's pen, the ''Voces Intimae.'' There are two early works of more than merely archival attention which have just been recorded by the Sibelius Academy Quartet (Finlandia FAD 345). The Quartet in A Minor (1889) and the Quartet in B-flat may call the works of Dvorak to mind: they are melodic, rather determinedly folksy, and have been been well served by the players. All of the recordings mentioned above are available only on standard, long-playing disks.

The conductor's atoms impede the flow, causing power to dissipate as heat. But as temperatures near absolute zero many substances become superconductors, offering no resistance.\nFor years, scientists have worked on devices that exploit this physical loophole: high-speed computers, fusion reactors, magnetically levitated trains. Superconductivity could conceivably be used to transmit power more efficiently, saving billions of dollars in lost energy.\nBut supercooling a conductor is difficult and expensive. Last week researchers announced breakthroughs that might ameliorate the task.\nA scientist at the University of Houston reported that by subjecting a chemical compound to extreme pressures, he had raised the temperature at which superconductivity occurs from 24 to 40.2 degrees Kelvin. On the Kelvin scale, 0 is absolute zero and water freezes at about 273 degrees.\nMeanwhile, scientists at A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories said they had found an alloy that under normal pressures exhibited superconductivity at a temperature not substantially lower than in the Houston experiment.\nThese developments enable scientists to use liquid hydrogen as a coolant instead of more expensive liquid helium. If the threshold can be raised much further, even cheaper liquid nitrogen could be used. Then superconductivity might begin to leave the realm of the exotic for what observers believe could be a multibillion-dollar market.\nIDEAS & TRENDS

The New England Congressional Institute, which provided research and analysis to the caucus, also has closed.\nTHE New England Congressional Caucus closed its doors last week, a victim of changing times and the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. The New England Congressional Institute, which provided research and analysis to the caucus, also has closed.\nFormed during the oil crisis of the early 70's, the caucus was comprised of the 24 Representatives from New England. Prior to Gramm-Rudman, its operating expenses for four full-time and 18 part-time employees was $75,000 to $80,000 a year, the money coming out of the budgets of each of the Representatives.\nAlthough no current figures were available, staff members said the caucus's budget has dropped steadily since the adoption of Gramm-Rudman, as members were less willing to sustain a body that cut into their legislative expense accounts.\nMoreover, lawmakers found that the need to operate the agenda-setting caucus for New England was inversely proportional to the region's economy, which has prospered a great deal more over the last several years than has the Federal budget.\nThe improved economy of the region ''in some sense put a damper on the crisis environment that really moved the members to work together,'' said Bailey Spencer, executive director of the caucus from 1981 to 1984. ''In politics, when times are good, it is more difficult to organize a kind of broad coalition to work together towards a common goal.''\nBut during the OPEC oil crisis in 1973 the New England delegation had little difficulty convening in emergency session.\n''The caucus was formed during the period when the energy crisis was front-page news,'' said Michael Sheehy, legislative director to Representative Edward P. Boland, the Massachusetts Democrat who was co-chairman of the caucus. ''It existed almost in a direct relationship to the visibility to energy problems, and as they became less visible and the Northeast economy improved, members saw less of a need for these unifying actions.''\nWith the influence of Massachusetts Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., who became Speaker of the House in 1976, the caucus spearheaded low-income energy assistance programs and repeatedly fended off proposals to impose oil-import fees.\nThe caucus also succeeded at moving through Congress legislation aimed at conservation of the coastal environment, clean water laws, tax benefits for the use of renewable energy resources and most recently, acid rain legislation.\nIn addition to the assistance of Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Boland, the caucus was aided by the leadership of Representative Silvio O. Conte, a Massachusetts Republican who was its co-chairman. Both Mr. Conte and Mr. Boland are influential members of the Committee on Appropriations, which sets financing for the Departments of the Interior and Energy.\nBut the caucus could not survive on leadership alone, and with its livelihood dependent on the generosity of a Representative's pocketbook, it and dozens of other informal regional organizations have fallen on bad times.\nOver the last two years the appropriation for legislative services, including staffing, has dropped. In addition, the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law, which was passed last December, required Congress to handle its own money more austerely.\nAlthough most of the larger Congressional caucuses will survive the current budget crunch, staff members expressed concern that the organizations, which provide expertise on complex issues, will continue to dwindle.\nMr. Sheehy described Gramm-Rudman as ''the crowning blow,'' because while it required uniform cuts of 4.3 percent in Congressional expenses, nearly all lawmakers were faced with having to institute 10 percent cuts for the remainder of fiscal 1986 to make up for the normal levels of spending they had operated under for the first six months of the year.\n''Members found that with reductions in those accounts that in some cases they had to forego paying their interns or had to let staff people go,'' he said. ''The caucus became too costly for the majority of members to afford.''\nThe New England Congressional Institute, in its heyday, was able to secure grants from the Department of Energy and private donations for up to $500,000 a year. Last year it collected $125,000, according to Howard N. Gaines, the outgoing director of the caucus.\n''It became apparent to us that the institute wasn't operating at the manpower that we hoped it would,'' Mr. Gaines said. ''With that, the institute was spending too much time on fund raising.''\nMr. Gaines said that his last recommendation to the lawmakers was that they retain the ''structure'' of the caucus for future regional battles in Congress and in anticipation of increased financing in the future.

''I can't believe that at the age of 16 I'm going to be coming in contact with people from a totally different background. The shock of it is more than anything I've ever experienced so far.''\nBut these performances may be more than an exceptionally exotic road show. Dean Adams, an English teacher who is director of theater at the 700-student private school in Windsor, said Chinese officials have told him that the production may be the first American musical performed on the mainland.\n''According to the Chinese Embassy in Washington, there has not been an American musical performed in China,'' Mr. Adams said. ''I'm not sure about whether there were any before the Cultural Revolution.''\nChinese officials are particularly interested in American musicals in general because they do not have any equivilant in their own culture, said Mr. Adams. But their interest seems ironic, since he and his wife, Kristin, who is choreographing the show, had to review some 150 musicals to find one that would meet the Chinese stipulations of ''no sex, no violence, no politics and no religion,'' he said.\n''We scoured the American musical theater to find a play that didn't have one, let along all four,'' Mr. Adams said. ''But even 'Oklahoma!' has a knife fight. Other shows are very violent, even though the violence is stylized, as in 'West Side Story.' 'Pippin,' which is my favorite, has sex, politics, violence and religion all in the same show.''\nThe idea for a China trip was born two years ago, after the Loomis Chaffee students successfully staged ''The Dining Room'' in London. Each winter, the group performs a musical, and, in alternating years, that production is taken ''on the road,'' thus far to various European cities. After the London trip, Mr. Adams began considering taking the group to Asia, ''so I thought, 'why not try to go to China,' '' he said. Upon learning from Chinese officials that a musical had never been performed there, ''that only served to encourage us, not discourage us,'' he said.\nMr. Adams decided to enlist the support of the State Department of Economic Development, and a letter outlining the proposal was presented to Chinese officials when the state's sister-city relationship was formally established with Shantung last May, said the Commissioner of Economic Development, John J. Carson.\n''We're very excited about it,'' he said of the upcoming trip, adding his hope that this will pave the way toward more cultural exchanges between the two states since Governor O'Neill and Gov. Li Chang-an of Shantung signed the agreement proclaiming the sister status in May. That agreement calls for business and trade ties as well as cultural and sports exchanges.\nUnder the agreement, a Chinese group would reciprocate the Loomis Chaffee visit later in the year or in early 1988, Mr. Adams said. He does not know what the Chinese students would perform, ''but anything they do will be fantastic,'' he said.\nThe group is to perform ''Once Upon a Mattress'' under the title ''The Princess and the Pea,'' taken from the Hans Christian Andersen story it was originally based on, so ''because the word 'mattress' sounds a bit lewd,'' Mr. Adams noted.\nThe musical was written and composed by Mary Rogers, Marshall Barier and Jay Thompson and tells the story of a prince whose mother tests possible brides by placing a pea under their mattress, reasoning that the real princess would be so ''delicate'' she would detect the pea, Mr. Adams said.\nAlthough the play was not his first choice, it bears similarities to Chinese theater, which is often based on mythology and fairy tales, he said. The play is also easy-to-understand, which should be a boon because the production is to be performed in English and no translators are to be used. A synopsis of the play is to be translated into Chinese and included in the program, he said.\nWith the acceptance of the proposal, fund raising is now under way, said Mr. Adams.\nAccording to him, the total cost of the project, including transportation, is $90,000, of which the school is paying $12,000. Parents of students who can afford it are to pay the entire tab of $2,586 a student, but the group is trying to raise $33,000 to enable a number of students who attend the school on full or partial scholarships to attend. About half of that sum has been raised. The fund-raising deadline is Jan. 15, he said.\nUnder the reciprocal agreement, the Chinese Government would pay some of the lodging costs, he added.\nTo raise the money, students are seeking contributions and selling program advertisements to corporations that have business interests in China.\nIn addition to fund raising, staging a production in China ''is certainly the most ambitious project we've undertaken, but it can be a logistical nightmare sometimes,'' said Mr. Adams. ''We're going to a place thousands of miles away, where they speak a different langugage. For example, while we know we'll arrive, we have no idea whether our scenery will, so we have to plan to do without.''\n''This is a student-to-student exchange, which is a little different than taking a Broadway production,'' he said. ''We're not expecting to do big performances in Beijing.''\nAlso, some of the students were initially a bit wary about traveling to China, so Mr. Adams is bringing in a series of lecturers to discuss the country's history and culture.\n''The students were very skeptical at first,'' he said. ''China seemed foreign, remote and scary, but now the members of the company are all very excited.''

Opening Wednesday through March 11, the show contains about 45 pieces of sculpture, paintings and prints done between the late 1920's and the present.\nWORKS BY NEVELSON A rare opportunity to see a comprehensive exhibition of the work of Louise Nevelson without going into New York, is offered in the new show at the Whitney Museum in Stamford. Opening Wednesday through March 11, the show contains about 45 pieces of sculpture, paintings and prints done between the late 1920's and the present.\nBest known for the compartmentalized sculptural walls, constructed of pieces of wood painted black, white or gold, Ms. Nevelson did not achieve prominence until 1958, when she was 58 years old. Her first major museum showing was at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1959, when she was included in an exhibition called ''Sixteen Americans.''\nMs. Nevelson was born in Kiev, Russia, in 1900 and came to this country with her family in 1905, settling in Rockland, Me. She moved to New York after her marriage to Charles Nevelson, and studied art here and abroad. Her first gallery showing was in 1933 at the Secession Gallery in Manhattan.\nThe Whitney Museum in New York began collecting her work in 1956 and in 1967 mounted her first museum retrospective. Another exhibition of her paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints was held in 1970, and in 1980, as a joint celebration of the Whitney's 50th birthday and Ms. Nevelson's 80th, the museum presented an exhibition called ''Atmospheres and Environments,'' which contained five of Ms. Nevelson's room-size installations.\nViewing hours are from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday, and gallery talks are given at 12:30 P.M. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. The Whitney is on the ground floor of the Champion International Building at Tresser Boulevard and Atlantic Street in Stamford. Admission is free. BENEFIT FOR CHILDREN\nPeter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary will be the featured performer at a benefit concert a week from today from 4 to 5:30 P.M. at the New Canaan High School. The event is one of many staged each year by an organization called Horizons, which sends about 200 inner-city children to the New Canaan Country School for a six-week summer enrichment program. Horizons pays the tuition cost of $825 a student.\nLast summer, 110 children, ranging from 4 to 14 years old, were enrolled from Stamford, 60 from Norwalk, 20 from New Canaan and 1 from Wilton. The exceptionally varied program, which also includes breakfast, lunch and snacks, offers morning studies in math, English, science, art, music and computers while afternoons are devoted to baseball, basketball, soccer and swimming. In addition, the children grow their own vegetables, receive a dental examination and participate in weekly trips to the South Street Seaport in New York City, the Bronx Zoo, the Bruce Museum in Greenwich and other points of interest in Connecticut and New York.\nPerhaps one of the best perquisites is the opportunity for making friends among children who would not otherwise have an opportunity to be together in such an atmosphere. Many of them return several times.\nGeneral admission to the concert is $10, reserved patron seating costs from $25 to $100. For reservations and more information call 972-0771, extension 231. Tickets may also be purchased at Bob's Sports Shop, 94 Park Street, Stamford. IN SEARCH OF EAGLES\nJanuary and February are considered to be the best months for observing wintering bald eagles in this region. Two adults and four young birds have been seen at Northeast Utilities's Shepaug hydroelectric site in Southbury, where an expanded viewing area has just reopened.\nEmployees of the Department of Environmental Protection and the utility company staff the viewing shelter, which is about 1,000 feet from the eagles's feeding area. The shelter has been enlarged to accommodate more people, and it also houses an exhibit about bald eagles in the state. The D.E.P. is doing a study of Connecticut's eagle population. The work, some of which is done at Shepaug, is expected to be completed in 1988.\n''We can't guarantee that you will see eagles any time you go, but the likelihood is good,'' said Rita Maroncelli-Duclos of the Environmental Department. ''They perch in the daytime looking for fish in the Housatonic River, swooping down to catch them. The action of the power facility keeps the ice broken up and the swirling water sometimes stuns the fish, making them easier to catch. That's why the birds are attracted here. Sometimes the younger ones just fly around in what seems to be play. The older eagles tend to stay on their perches.''\nStaff members find the birds with a spotting telescope, but binoculars are essential for individual birdwatchers. The shelter is open from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. Fridays through Mondays until March 15, except in very bad weather. To reach it, take South Britain Road, Exit 14 off I-84, go right off the exit, then left at the traffic light for one mile to a stop sign, then right on Fish Rock Road, which becomes River Road to the dam area, where signs point the way to the viewing site. Call 584-9830 for more information. BIRDS OF THE THAMES\nMore than 15 other species of birds that winter on the Thames River will be the focus of a Winter Waterfowl Walk conducted by the Thames Science Center, Gallows Lane, New London from 3:30 to 5 P.M. Saturday. An assistant professor of zoology at Connecticut College, Robert Askins, will give a short talk at the center before leading the group along the waterside near Smith's Cove and Mamacoke Island.\nMale goldeneyes, mergansers and canvasbacks are among the ducks expected to be sighted, along with geese and swans. Warm clothing, binoculars and a $5 fee are all that is required. Call 442-0391 to register or obtain more information. FRENCH COMIC STRIPS\nDominique Regney-Gillain is to give a talk about her father, the artist Joseph Gillain, at 3 P.M. Thursday in the Low-Heywood Thomas School, 1570 Newfield Avenue, Stamford. As is customary for lectures sponsored by the Alliance Francaise of Stamford, the talk, titled ''French Comic Strips,'' is to be in French.\nDuring a long career, until his death in 1980, Gillain created numerous comic strips that ran serially in weekly magazines in Belgium and France. Jerry Spring, an American cowboy and his sidekick, Poncho, were two of his best-known characters, inspired during several years spent in the United States. Tanguy and Laverdure are two more of his most popular characters.\nMany Gillain strips were translated into other European languages and some have continued publication, drawn by other artists. Admission to the program is $5 at the door.\nMrs. Regney-Gillain, an artist in her own right, has lived in the United States for 20 years. Her husband, Noel Regney, is a composer who wrote, among other things, the Christmas carol ''Do You Hear What I Hear?'' Early in January she is to begin teaching French to small groups of children aged 4 to 10. ''It will be a special kind of teaching, relating the language to the arts, cooking and other cultural references,'' she said. Those interested in learning more about it may call her at 798-0006. MUSICAL CELEBRATION\nA few of Richard Vogt's friends are to help him celebrate his 20th anniversary as director of music at the First Congregational Church of Old Greenwich on Saturday. Dave Brubeck is to play the piano, joined by Cynthia Clarey, mezzo-soprano; John Aler, tenor; Jake Gardner, baritone; Bob Fortunato, singer-dancer, and Scott Youngs, organist. They will all follow the direction of Mr. Vogt's baton in a concert titled ''Joyful Noise'' at 5 P.M. and again at 7:30 P.M. The public is invited. Complimentary tickets are available by calling 637-1791.

This means an athlete is four times more likely than a nonathlete to finish his or her first year of college in academic difficulty. In contrast, no athletes beyond the first year of college reported a grade-point average below 2.0.\nThese findings, along with others beyond the scope of this short letter, lead us to think that colleges are doing freshmen a disservice by encouraging these young people to put their college careers at risk when a likely reward for athletic participation is academic probation.\nWe should emphasize that this survey was conducted at an institution that places its priorities on academics.

That is not the case. A number of ''medigap'' insurance policies, combined with Medicare Parts A and B, offer essentially the same coverage Dr. Bowen is proposing, with less annual liability than Dr. Bowen's $2,000 maximum.\nFor example, the American Association of Retired Persons offers a policy nationally that, combined with Medicare, provides at least as much as Dr. Bowen proposes for less than $400 annually, including monthly premiums and the $75 Part B deductible not paid by the policy or Medicare. And it includes 365 additional hospital days beyond Medicare, subject to Medicare standards. A Medicare and Blue Cross-Blue Shield medigap package in my area of Pennsylvania costs about $500 annually. Why trade a $400 to $500 liability for $2,000?\nSome alternative suggestions:\n* Offer a Medicare program with no co-pays or deductibles. Co-pays and deductibles produce the massive confusion resulting in $3 billion yearly wasted by the elderly in excess and duplicate health-insurance premiums. Dr. Bowen's proposal does not remove the key points of con-fusion, and most would still buy supplemental insurance.\n* Replace the lost Medicare co-pay-deductible income with a monthly premium the elderly would pay in addition to the current Part B premium. Not having to pay for medigap insurance would free that money to pay the higher Medicare premium, with fuller coverage in one place and no paper work worries, as providers would handle claims directly with the Government, as occurs now with Medicare health-maintenance organizations. Obviously, physicians should also be required to accept the Medicare rate as payment in full, just as hospitals and nursing homes do.\n* Relate the additional premium to income. A person having $6,000 annual income shouldn't have to pay the same premium as one with $60,000 income. Medicare would still not be an income-eligible program but would also be based on a range of premiums, based on income. An income relationship precedent was established with the 1983 Social Security amendments taxing some of those benefits related to income.\n* If Congress will not totally eliminate Medicare co-pays-deductibles, then consider other proposals far preferable to Dr. Bowen's, such as one introduced in August by Representative Don Bonker of Washington.\nMedicare needs simplification. Its complexity is a national disgrace. Dr. Bowen's proposal minimizes some of that confusion, but not much, and offers little if anything, often less than Medicare's enrollment can get today by combining Medicare and a decent medigap policy. The biggest surprise is the reaction to the proposal by many, including you, that it will make a significant difference, rather than being seen as a mirage in the total picture of necessary Medicare reform. If this is the best we can hope for in the next Congressional session, then heaven help the elderly because worldly sources have decided not to do so. PETER D. ARCHEY Reading, Pa., Dec. 16, 1986 The writer is a consultant on aging and health systems.
904	TROUBLED FOSTER CHILDREN GET SPECIAL AID	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DD1E3BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THE most troubled of foster children - the destructive and even self-destructive -will be offered new chances for family life under a state program that is to start this month.\nTHE most troubled of foster children - the destructive and even self-destructive -will be offered new chances for family life under a state program that is to start this month.\nIt is hoped that the program, being undertaken by the staff at the Norwich office of the state's Department of Children and Youth Services, will be a model for similar programs around the state.\nThe Norwich office has received a $182,500 grant from the Federal Department of Health and Human Services to set up foster homes for particularly troubled youngsters and to provide assistance for both the foster parents and the natural families of the youngsters. The grant is one of five awarded throughout the nation, and the only one awarded to a state agency.\nIn Connecticut, there are nearly 4,000 young people (from infants to 18-year-olds) who have been placed in care outside their own homes because they were neglected or abused in some way. About 1,750 are in licensed foster homes that care for up to five children. For some, however, regular foster homes do not work out.\nThe supervisor of the Youth Services office in Norwich, Ann Quinn, said she had sought funds for specialized foster care after noticing how many ''really young children'' were being placed in special residential schools or in psychiatric hospitals after even experienced foster parents could not cope with their destructive, disturbing behavior.\nShe described a 6-year-old foster child whose own parents had frequently left him alone, and had also left him with at least one person who sexually molested him. Under Youth Services care ''he'd been in three foster homes; in one, he lasted three days,'' Miss Quinn said. In one of the homes, the boy wrecked a television set.\nShe said that troubled youngsters often not only damaged property, but also harmed animals, other people and themselves.\nGood institutions could often help such children, she said, but ''an institution is not a home.\n''Over and over,'' she said, ''we saw that we needed an alternative. Across the state, there is a need to develop something in-between a regular foster home and an institution.''\nWith the Federal grant, staff members in the Norwich office are to recruit and train foster parents who will provide a home for just one child, not several. The staff is to provide therapy for the children, their foster parents and their natural families. They intend to help foster parents find services - from doctors and dentists to school programs - that the child may need, and to help the foster parents form support groups.\nArrangements are to be set up so the foster parents can get a night or even a weekend off from their difficult jobs. Taking turns, the staff members are to be on call 24 hours a day for the foster parents.\n''We're putting together a network of services for families,'' said social worker for the Norwich program, Deborah Hallas.\nOnce the Norwich program is under way, the department plans to use state funds to establish similar programs in each of its five administrative regions. Each program is to serve 10 youngsters.\nThese programs will help ''to prevent kids from being placed in institutions, and to move kids currently in institutions back into family environments,'' said the department's deputy commissioner for administrative services, Ralph Adkins. Youngsters who are in institutions and whose behavior has stabilized, but who are not ready to go to regular foster homes or to their own homes, can be placed in special foster care, he said.\nThe Norwich staff members stressed that the goal of the program was to return youngsters to their natural parents, and that they would work with both natural and foster parents.\nMiss Quinn said people who neglect and abuse their children often had parents who did the same to them. ''We want to break that cycle,'' she said. She said the program would aid natural parents who had problems with drugs or alcohol, or were simply ''overwhelmed.''\nIn addition, the foster parents will be asked to talk with the natural parents and to encourage visits between the child and his natural parents.\nPeople who want to help troubled youngsters may be angry at those who hurt them in the first place, said the coordinator of the Norwich program, Steven Roe. But, he said, special foster parents will ''need to go out of their way to become friends of the natural parents.''\nRegular foster parents who have cared for youngsters with serious problems say the new program sounds helpful.\nTraining can help foster parents recognize signs of deprivation and abuse, said Dana Clark of Old Saybrook, who has cared for 46 children, usually about three at a time, over the past six years. Training can also help them manage troubled youngsters, she said.\n''It takes a lot of imagination to help these kids get some structure in their lives,'' she said.\nShe said help from the department in finding medical services for foster children would be especially important. Many physicians used to middle-class patients are not very helpful in treating foster children whose disrupted lives compounded their medical problems, she said, nor did such physicians welcome the complicated forms involved in billing the state for the youngsters' treatment.\nNorwich staff members said that they had sought advice from Mrs. Clark and other foster parents when developing the program and that they expect the special program to help focus attention on ways to improve foster care in general.\nMiss Quinn and her staff are now seeking people willing to tackle, and stick to, the job of giving specialized foster care. Training for the program is to start later this month. Special foster parents will receive stipends of about $600 a month, slightly more than regular foster parents.\nThe Youth Services office in Norwich serves 54 communities in eastern Connecticut, but anyone in the state interested in being a foster parent in the new program or in existing programs may call the Norwich staff at 886-2641.
905	Bowen Plan Showed Concern for Age's Terrors; The 80 Percent Myth	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1E3BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: To the Editor: As one Medicare subscriber of many who might reply to ''Fighting Catastrophe for $4.92 a Month'' (editorial, Dec. 5), I view your interpretation of how Part B of Medicare works as simplistic.\nTo the Editor: As one Medicare subscriber of many who might reply to ''Fighting Catastrophe for $4.92 a Month'' (editorial, Dec. 5), I view your interpretation of how Part B of Medicare works as simplistic.\nPhysicians in the New York area, and perhaps in all but remote regions, exercise their right, often justifiably, to charge patients more than the amounts recognized as reasonable by the Government. It is a myth that Medicare patients receive 80 percent of what they are charged or what they are entitled to, even after their deductible has been satisfied.\nTwo random examples:\n* A physician's bill of $175, approved for $72.20 by Medicare (further reduced by 1 percent by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill), was reduced to 80 percent, or $57.76. Payment was $57.18.\n* A diagnostic X-ray was billed by the hospital at $55. Medicare's approved charge was $40, 80 percent of which is $32. The reimbursement check was slightly less, $31.68 (a consistent practice).\nAny attempt to challenge or receive clarification is impossible. After hours of dialing, a caller may congratulate himself on having reached someone - only to receive recorded instructions to wait for a staff member to be free and to have proper identification numbers available. This message is repeated several minutes. Then another recording states that all interviewers are too busy, and the caller is asked to phone again, and with that the caller is clicked off.\nThe Bowen plan addresses itself to the increase of services to Medicare patients while the fee for each service is frozen. Perhaps an examination of the discrepancies between the charged fees and approved fees is more necessary. ALAN BUXTON\nHackensack, N.J., Dec. 8, 1986

Fans and officials think, however, that ''the drug problem in football is no worse than in society in general.'' This may well be true of the addictive narcotic class of drug with which we are all familiar.\nHowever, there is a type of dangerous drug with which fans are less familiar, and for which the professional and elite amateur athlete is providing the role model. This is the anabolic steroid, the so-called ''muscle building'' or ''strength building'' drug. Steroid use started at the top of the athletic pyramid: the world-class athlete, the professional athlete, the competitive body builder.\nIt is now reaching down to the lower-level athlete. We are seeing more college athletes being banned because of the detection of steroid use. Steroids continue to insidiously spread to other groups -to the high school athlete and to the recreational athlete, both male and female - in the mistaken belief that they are beneficial and harmless.\nThere is very little scientific evidence to even suggest that anabolic steroids really do, in any way, increase strength, but there is abundant, irrefutable evidence to show that steroids can and do cause permanent and serious damage to those who use them.\nThis is especially the case in the young, growing athlete and in the female athlete. Steroids may cause premature cessation of growth in the child; masculinization in the female; and sterility, liver disease and liver tumors and heart disease in all.\nThe use of steroids must be reserved for treatment of illnesses for which they are medically indicated and in proper medically prescribed dosages. Athletic use is dangerous and is affecting more and more innocent, young athletes who believe that, unlike narcotics, steroids are healthy.\nThe purpose of sport is to make healthy people healthier. This requires education, understanding and prevention. It is prevention rather than treatment of injury and illness that is the important function of sports medicine.\nMARK I.

I noticed that their team shirts named them as Lady Rams. To the best of my knowledge, the word ''ram'' is only used to refer to a masculine animal, and when I pointed this out to them they were unable to explain this obvious scientific error.\nFordham is considered to be one of the finest educational institutions in this area and it bothered me that they would choose such an uneducated name. I consulted with my father-in-law, who is a scientist and the only Fordham alumnus in my family. He indicated that he couldn't care less about this situation.\nA suggestion to correct this problem: The female version of a ram is called a ewe and the team should be known as the Fordham U. Ewes, which could be familiarly called the Fordham ''you-yous.'' Now there is a name behind which we can all rally.\nROBERT POPISH\nBlauvelt, N.Y.

The Yankee bullpen is already a force to be reckoned with, and the starters are on their way to a successful season. But a team can never have enough power hitters. The Yankees definitely do not lack in power, but with the runs that must be scored late in the season, Mr. October could have helped take them to the pennant.\nNICHOLAS T. SCHARLATT\nBronx
911	TROOPERS GET TEST OF STRESS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DC1E3BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A TASK FORCE has spent $60,000 testing Connecticut state troopers for hypertension and stress-related diseases, and is now seeking $150,000 to develop a program to solve some of the problems it discovered.\nA TASK FORCE has spent $60,000 testing Connecticut state troopers for hypertension and stress-related diseases, and is now seeking $150,000 to develop a program to solve some of the problems it discovered.\n''This is the first time in the country that an entire department has been profiled,'' said the chairman of the task force, James M. Abbondanza.\nThe study found that many officers have styles of life that can contribute to heart disease and other ailments, while more than 70 troopers were found to have illnesses in need of immediate attention.\n''We've developed some good, hard data, and now we want to follow up on it,'' Mr. Abbondanza said.\nThe follow-up, if the budget is approved, will include installing computerized health-testing and exercise equipment at each of the 17 state police barracks, Mr. Abbondanza said.\n''Psychologically, there might not be many jobs tougher than being a cop,'' said a member of the task force, Sgt. Ronald Clark, who the commanding officer of the State Police employee assistance program.\n''But we can do something about it, we can intervene, we can help,'' Sergeant Clark said. ''If we can intervene early enough, it's really life-saving.''\nThe stress management program also has the full support of the state police union, which has representatives on the task force, said the director of political action for the union, James E. Duffy.\n''A program like this is a solution to the problems a lot of police forces have faced for a number of years,'' Mr. Duffy said. The task force was established in 1984 as a result of negotiations between the union and management, which is trying to reduce the number of heart and hypertension claims by state police under state law.\nUnion officials and administrators were named to the panel, and a neutral observer, Mr. Abbondanza, was named chairman. Mr. Abbondanza, an associate professor of psychology at Niagara County Community College in New York, has worked with police departments across the country on stress-related problems for more than a dozen years.\nMr. Abbondanza said the typical case of ''burn out'' occurred an average of 11 years after an officer joined the force. Symptoms might include the use of excessive force or over-reaction to a situation by an officer with a good work record, problems with sleeping, marital discord, and physical complaints such as digestive disorders, he said.\nSuppressed stress, Mr. Abbondonza said, can lead to a variety of other problems, including diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and suicide.\nThe stress management task force supervised the study of 120 health variables among the state's 957 troopers over the last several months, and the data are being analyzed by the Control Data Corporation of Minneapolis, Mr. Abbondanza said.\nInitial results showed 71 officers in immediate danger from diabetes, heart disease and other illnesses, Mr. Abbondanza said. Those troopers were notified and referred to private physicians.\nBut the study uncovered a number of other alarming statistics, Mr. Abbondanza said, including that 170 officers, 19 percent of the sample, suffered a serious hypertension problem, and 191, or 21 percent, had high cholesterol levels.\nMany of the problems are aggravated by the way the officer live, Mr. Abbondanza said, because 30 officers, 3 percent, were heavy drinkers, 284, or 31 percent, were overweight, 137, 15 percent, were heavy smokers, and 162, or 18 percent, did not exercise enough.\n''I think these results are generally reflective of the type of health risks that police officers are encountering around the country,'' Mr. Abbondanza said.\nBut the problems go beyond styles of life, Mr. Abbondanza said. Troopers must routinely deal with problems such as child abuse, murder, drug addiction and other situations that bother them long after the workday is complete, and often lead to domestic problems.\n''They face things every day that the average person might not have to face in a lifetime,'' Mr. Abbondanza said. ''They have to develop a sort of armor to it, and as they're developing that armor, they shut themselves off from their families and their own feelings.''\nSergeant Clark said that for the last 10 years, his unit had tried to help troopers through such stressful situations. An officer is routinely dispatched when a trooper kills or injures someone, or for incidents such as when a child is killed.\n''We're not there to interfere, just to support the officer,'' Sergeant Clark said.\nThat can often be a difficult job, he said. ''What can you do with a cop who sees a kid crushed by a 50-ton trailer-truck?'' he said.\n''Everyone tells you as cop, you have to get used to those things,'' Sergeant Clark said. ''But I've never seen any human being who got used to seeing dead kids.''\nSergeant Clark's unit also encourages troopers to bring families to the training academy, a change from the traditional thinking that family and professional lives be kept separate.\nThe equipment being sought to install in state police barracks would include instruments for testing blood pressure, weight, heart rate and other vital signs, as well as exercise equipment. There would be instruction in stress-reduction techniques such as muscle relaxation through bio-feedback.\nEach officer would have a computer disk that would track progress toward weight and health goals, Mr. Abbondanza said. And in two years another series of health tests would be done to determine the program's impact.\nSergeant Clark said he would also like to see recruits educated about the dangers of stress, and how to avoid them.\n''Police officers have to be educated about stress literally from the day they come on the force,'' Sergeant Clark said. ''If they don't know how to handle it, we're going to see -we're seeing now - some very serious ramifications.''\nAnd Mr. Duffy, the police union official, said a change in the way troopers are rotated into different assignments might help relieve stress. Currently, he said, it is not uncommon for an officer to remain on the same assignment for more than a dozen years, even though state police are responsible for everything from inspection of carnival rides to fire investigations in Connecticut.\n''To leave someone out on the highways for 10 years might not lead to a heart attack,'' Mr. Duffy said, ''but it's going to cause some type of problem, whether it's ulcers or hypertension or whatever.''\n''If someone isn't given an opportunity to change, to try new experiences, there is a tremendous stress factor,'' he said.

913	CONTROLS ON SWANS PROPOSED	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DC1E3BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THE state's swan population is growing at such a rate that the birds pose a danger to other wildlife, some biologists say. But recommendations that the swans be held in check by killing their embryos is being strongly resisted by other authorities, including the state's Commissioner of Environmental\nTHE state's swan population is growing at such a rate that the birds pose a danger to other wildlife, some biologists say. But recommendations that the swans be held in check by killing their embryos is being strongly resisted by other authorities, including the state's Commissioner of Environmental Protection.\nThe graceful white birds with curving necks and wing spans of up to six feet are very aggressive in protecting their nesting areas, to the point of driving off other waterfowl, fishermen and even local property owners, wildlife experts note. The problem is made worse, they say, by a population that has grown to 1,450 along the eastern shores of Connecticut and is spreading westward.\n''They're beautiful, but they can be out of control,'' said Noble Proctor, a writer and lecturer on birds who teaches biology at Southern Connecticut State University.\nIn a recent report, Gregory Chasko, a state biologist, recommended that the birds' population be reduced by shaking swan eggs to prevent their hatching and also by killing some swans.\nBut Stanley J. Pac, Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, said he did not see a need for a control program, and added that he had received ''a tremendous outpouring of letters in opposition'' to swan-control proposals.\nMr. Chasko's recommendations are being reviewed by state officials, the Sierra Club, the Connecticut Audubon Society, the New England office of the National Audubon Society, the Connecticut Water Fowlers Association and other conservation and sportmen's groups.\nMilan G. Bull, director of field studies and ornithology at the Fairfield Regional Center of the Connecticut Audubon Society, said he expected that the society would support Mr. Chasko's proposal to shake eggs because swans were competing for food with other birds, especially black ducks. However, he said, ''we would not support outright killing of swans.''\nDr. Proctor said that he would support both shaking eggs and killing some swans.\n''Other species are suffering unjustly because of what people introduced,'' he said.\nSwans are not native to North America, but were brought from Europe to grace shoreside estates. Some escaped and are now wild, living along the Connecticut and Thames Rivers.\nThe birds ''will defend their territory against people and other waterfowl,'' Mr. Chasko said, noting that he has seen swans attacking fishermen, boaters and bathers. It is distressing to fishermen, he said, to be kept away from their favorite spots and to waterside property owners to be kept from their own backyards.\nMr. Pac acknowledged that the birds are ''quite possessive,'' but added that ''we haven't had untoward incidents.''\nIn his report, Mr. Chasko also noted that when large numbers of swans frequent a particular area, they foul the shore and water with their droppings.\nBut Priscilla Feral, New England director of Friends of Animals, a national animal protection organization, said that the swan droppings ''enrich plant life.''\nMs. Feral also noted that figures from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service show that duck and geese populations in Connecticut have increased substantially in recent years, countering Mr. Chasko's claims that the swans are so aggressive they will chase away other waterfowl, and their numbers reduce available food.\nDavid Rosgen, field coordinator for the Connecticut Breeding Bird Atlas, said that during non-nesting seasons, swans may ''get along fine'' with other species, but that ''if swans don't let other species breed, we'll lose those species.'' Swans had driven several varieties of ducks from the Niantic River, he said.\nBut swans' eating habits help keep excessive plant growth from clogging waterways and also free up plants so that other birds can reach them, Ms. Feral said.\nIn Mr. Chasko's report, ''The Impact of Mute Swans on Water Fowl and Water Fowl Habitat,'' he recommended shaking eggs in all swan nests on state property and in those on private property at the request of the owners. Shaking the eggs kills the embryos inside, but leaves the eggs intact, so the swan continues to incubate them. If the eggs were destroyed, the swan would simply lay another batch.\nMr. Chasko also recommended that swans causing problems, in areas where they are very numerous, for instance, be euthanized. He advised against legalizing the hunting of swans, even though hunting them would be ''the most cost-effective'' control technique, he wrote.\nRhode Island has had an egg shaking program for several years, and it has ''held the population in check, but we still have growth,'' said Charles Allin, a biologist with the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The state does not have a policy of killing swans, he said.\nRhode Island's swan population would be ''skyrocketing'' without egg shaking, he said, and he hoped Connecticut would adopt the practice, too.\n''Part of our problem is, the influx of swans from Connecticut is tremendous,'' Mr. Allin said.\nWilliam Mannetti, president of the New Haven-based Animal Rights Front, said he feared that a swan-control policy could lead to permitting the hunting of swans.\n''There's a lot of pressure from the hunting community to increase game species,'' he said. ''Wildlife should be held in trust for all of us.''\nHe also questioned Mr. Chasko's findings on the numbers of swans in Connecticut and their impact on the environment.\nMs. Feral said she too objected ''on moral and biological grounds to any plan to control or manage mute swans.'' People should leave swans alone, she said, and natural controls, including such predators as snapping turtles, would keep the population in check. Mr. Chasko wanted to protect ducks and geese from swans, she said, in order to provide ''target opportunities'' for hunters.\nPublic hearings would be scheduled if the state decides to to adopt a swan control program.\n''Somewhere in the future, if circumstances warrant it, it might be considered,'' Commissioner Pac said. ''But at this point, after reviewing the report, I don't see a need for it.''
914	3 HARTFORD HIGH SCHOOLS LIFT RESTRICTIONS ON FANS AT GAMES	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DB1E3BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: STAN PIORKOWSKI, the varsity basketball coach at Hartford Public High School, can still recall looking around at one home game last season and seeing fewer than than 40 people in the stands.\nSTAN PIORKOWSKI, the varsity basketball coach at Hartford Public High School, can still recall looking around at one home game last season and seeing fewer than than 40 people in the stands.\n''I think there were 37, and that included members of our jayvee [ junior varsity ] team, which had played the first game,'' Mr. Piorkowski said.\nThat was a far cry from crowds in the past, which averaged about 700 and ran as high as 1,800 for games against city rival, Weaver High. By comparison, crowds last season averaged about 115, Mr. Piorkowski said.\nAttendance also decreased sharply at home games for Weaver and the city's third public high school, Bulkeley High. In all three instances, the decline had nothing to do with the teams' records, since all three schools won more games than they lost.\nWhat led to the decrease was a ruling, put into effect shortly after the 1985-86 season began last December, that barred ''outsiders'' from attending home games at all three schools.\nThat ruling was rescinded recently by the Hartford Superintendent of Schools, Hernan LaFontaine, in response to a recommendation that the general public again be admitted to basketball games but that more stringent crowd-control measures be taken.\nThe recommendation was drawn up following a series of meetings this fall that involved Lou Bazzano, the coordinator of physical education and athletics for the three Hartford high schools; the principals of the three schools, faculty managers; representatives of the Hartford Police Department, and the schools' security administrator, Peter Roach.\nThe policy banning the general public from high school games, believed to have been the first of its kind in the state, was imposed following an incident during a game on Dec. 16, 1985, between Weaver High and Windsor High School at the Weaver field house.\nDespite the presence of police and security officers, a number of skirmishes broke out in the stands several times during the game. On two occasions, hundreds of spectators ran onto the basketball court, forcing a halt to play. After the last interruption, Eddie Davis, the Weaver principal, ordered the field house cleared of all spectators, except those from Windsor.\nMr. Davis said the disorders involved outsiders who made up a large segment of the crowd of about 800 spectators at the game. While there were no injuries, the principal said there were a number of angry confrontations that frightened some of the students in attendance.\nAfter that incident, the principals of the three schools met with other school officials, after which the ban was imposed. Although similar bans have been imposed in New York and Philadelphia, no one could recall a similar action ever having been taken in Connecticut.\nIn an effort to avoid disorders, Hartford high school officials have scheduled City Series games between the three high schools in the afternoon for several years. And as a precaution, Weaver High, the site of a number of disturbances over the years, has played all of its home games in the afternoon - with the varsity games starting at 4:30 P.M. - for about a decade.\n''We always regarded the ban as a temporary measure,'' Mr. Bazzano said. ''We never expected it to be permanent. But we have tightened controls and anyone who does not abide by our rules will be denied the privilege of attending the games, whether it's a student or an outsider.''\nAs part of an increased security operation, which took effect when the current season began in mid-December, at least two city police officers are assigned to each home game, along with regular school security officers. In addition, at Weaver High a number of parents and alumni have signed up to oversee crowd behavior while wearing identifying black armbands.\nCrowds during the opening home game at all three schools were well-behaved and attendance was up considerably from last season, when the ban was in effect. For example, about 600 spectators attended Hartford Public's opening game against South Windsor High; that crowd was roughly six times larger than the average gathering at Hartford Public's home games during the 1985-86 season.\n''What we've mainly got to watch out for are outsiders bent on causing trouble,'' Mr. Bazzano said. ''And we're going to be on our toes.''\nJoe DiChiara, the varsity basketball coach at Bulkeley, said there had been no problems at his school in the past. ''We've had some isolated fights in the stands, but you'll find that anywhere, not just at an inner-city school.''\nCrowds at Bulkeley games, which usually average about 500, averaged slightly less than 100 last season, Mr. DiChiara said, even though the team won the Central Connecticut Conference South title.\n''It was weird,'' the coach said. ''If anyone raised their voice during a game, you could hear it all over the gym. There's no doubt that the kids missed the crowds, but they still worked hard.''\nMr. Piorkowski, the coach at Hartford Public, said the much smaller crowds appeared to have had an effect on his players, even though the team finished with a 14-6 record.\n''Several players quit the team and some of the kids seemed to be uninspired,'' he said. ''But I don't know whether there was a direct correlation between what happened and the small crowds. I do know, though, that the season was one of the low ebbs of my career.''\nBoth Mr. DiChiara and Mr. Piorkowski said that student attendance at games also declined. ''A lot of kids lost their I.D. cards and wouldn't bother to get new ones, and so they stopped going to the games,'' Mr. Piorkowski said.\nTechnically, only students producing identification cards, parents of players, coaches, college scouts and sportswriters were admitted to the games last season. But at times the rules were bent. ''As a rule, anyone who appeared to be sober or said, 'I'm an alumnus' was let in at our home games,'' Mr. Piorkowski said.\nAll three coaches said that their players appeared to have been affected to some degree at playing in what at times were near-empty gymnasiums. ''It took some adjustment,'' said Dwight Tolliver, the coach at Weaver High. ''But after a while, the kids got used to playing with hardly anyone around.''\nCrowds at Weaver home games last season averaged around 200, about one-third of what the team usually draws, Mr. Tolliver said. Despite the relatively small turnouts, the Weaver cagers had an outstanding season, posting a 19-5 record and losing in the quarterfinals of the state tournament by one point to Hillhouse High of New Haven, the eventual state champion in the large-school division.\n''Ninety percent of the time the trouble we had at home games was caused by outsiders,'' Mr. Tolliver said. ''But when there were altercations between students, strangely enough, it usually involved girl students, usually in the City Series games.''\nAll three coaches said they felt that last season's ban on outsiders could prove salutary in the long run.\n''I think it's going to help at all three schools,'' Mr. DiChiara, the Bulkeley coach, said. ''We've made it clear that we're not going to take any junk and that if outsiders want to come to the games, they're going to have to behave.''
915	MAYOR UPSET AT HAVING DOG WITH A PAST	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDA1E3BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: SHERRY WILLIAMSON, the executive assistant to Stamford Mayor Thom Serrani, refers to it as ''Doggiegate,'' as do some members of the Stamford Police Department.\nSHERRY WILLIAMSON, the executive assistant to Stamford Mayor Thom Serrani, refers to it as ''Doggiegate,'' as do some members of the Stamford Police Department.\nWhile it is hardly a high-priority item, the police in Stamford, along with the Mayor's office, are trying to find out why no one told Mr. Serrani that a mixed-breed collie he adopted from the city dog pound on Dec. 23, and subsequently named Buddy, had bitten a 14-year-old girl on Dec. 2.\nThere was a long-standing animosity between the Mayor and the dog warden, Beverly Bowler. Miss Bowler conceded in an interview that she might have been remiss in not telling Mr. Serrani that he was taking home a dog that had bitten someone.\n''The Mayor has treated our office with contempt for three years, and maybe that was a factor in my not telling him,'' said Miss Bowler who officially stepped down as the dog warden last week. ''I probably should have told him that the dog had bitten the girl, but I didn't think it was important because the dog is not vicious. But I take responsibility for not doing so.''\nMiss Bowler announced her resignation a month ago, and has insisted it was unrelated to the incident.\nThe Mayor's adoption of the dog came about after the Police Department's liaison with the pound, Patrolman Daniel Vaccaro, ordered Miss Bowler and her three assistants to begin killing dogs because of overcrowded conditions.\nAfter countermanding Patrolman Vaccaro's order, Mr. Serrani announced that he planned to go to the pound to adopt a dog. The Mayor then toured the pound on Dec. 12 with his wife, Beth, and Gloria Scheuer, an official of Adopt-A-Dog, a nonprofit dog adoption service staffed by volunteers that is based in Greenwich.\nWhile at the pound, the Mayor and his wife took a fancy to the mixed-breed collie, which had been at the Magee Avenue site since biting the girl in a schoolyard in the Shippan section of town.\n''Both Mr. Serrani and his wife walked and played with the dog, which is about 4 years old, and it seemed extremely friendly,'' Mrs. Scheuer said. ''When we asked one of the dog wardens about it, she said it was a lovable, friendly dog.''\n''But no one ever told us that the dog had bitten anyone or had been placed in quarantine, as biters are supposed to be for between 14 and 16 days,'' she said. ''If they had, we would have gone on to another dog.''\nMrs. Scheuer said that when she and the Serranis visited the pound, there were about 60 dogs, about double the acceptable capacity.\n''The Stamford pound has always been very crowded,'' she said. Miss Bowler, the former dog warden, agreed. ''We've complained about conditions for years and have asked the city to expand the facilities, but they've ignored us.'' she said.\nBut Mrs. Williamson, the Mayor's aide, said that $96,460 that had been allocated to the dog warden's office in the 1983-84 capital budget had never been used. ''The money is still sitting there and available,'' she said.\nAsked why the money had not been used, Miss Bowler said it was insufficient for expansion. ''We needed a lot more, and asked for another $155,000 in 1985, so that we could double the pound, but we never got it,'' she said.\nMiss Bowler, who was the dog warden for five years, said she thought her less-than-amicable relationship with Mr. Serrani stemmed from a series of incidents involving a dog he had owned before he became mayor.\n''We got quite a few complaints from neighbors complaining about his dog, which was always running loose, and we got after him,'' Miss Bowler said. ''At the time, he was a state senator, but I didn't know him from Adam. I think maybe he hasn't forgotten about that.''\nIn response, Mrs. Williamson said, ''That's ludicrous, I'm certain that never happened.''\nDeputy Police Chief John Moriarty, whose office has jurisdiction over the pound, said Mr. Serrani had commissioned a designer to see whether the pound can be expanded.\n''Even though it's usually overcrowded, dogs usually aren't put to sleep unless they've been grievously injured or are seriously ill with no prognosis for recovery,'' he said.\nAs it was, Chief Moriarty said, the order to do away with some dogs at the pound ''turned a negative into a positive'' once the public became aware of the situation. According to Mrs. Scheuer, about 18 dogs were adopted within a few weeks after Patrolman Vaccaro issued his order.\nMayor Serrani was on vacation last week and unavailable for comment. But Mrs. Williamson, his executive aide, said he was ''disturbed that proper procedures had not been followed'' - meaning that the Mayor had not been told the dog he was adopting had bitten someone.\n''The Mayor is a dog lover and his visit to the pound turned out to be a propitious one,'' Mrs. Williamson said. ''It's a wonderful dog, friendly and housebroken, and the Mayor and Mrs. Serrani are very happy with it.''\nSo much so, the Mayor's aide said, that they took the dog on vacation with them.\nAs for Miss Bowler, she said she was moving to Schoharie, in upstate New York, to establish a house-cleaning service. ''I lost interest in the dog warden's job, and I finally just gave up,'' she said. ''Now, I want to get as far away from dogs as I can - at least for a while.''
916	WORRIED PARENTS SEEK SAFE ACTIVITIES FOR TEEN-AGERS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D91E3BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: THE fear of teen-age drug and alcohol abuse is motivating parents to help their youngsters find safer social pursuits. Activity centers for teen-agers, pledges by parents to supervise at-home parties, greater support by parents for the athletic endeavors of their children and setting aside an area in the home where young people can entertain their friends are some of the avenues being tried around the state.\nTHE fear of teen-age drug and alcohol abuse is motivating parents to help their youngsters find safer social pursuits. Activity centers for teen-agers, pledges by parents to supervise at-home parties, greater support by parents for the athletic endeavors of their children and setting aside an area in the home where young people can entertain their friends are some of the avenues being tried around the state.\nIn addition to alcohol and drug abuse, parents say they worry about their children contacting diseases such as herpes and AIDS from casual sexual encounters. They also are concerned about their children getting involved in street violence, especially in the larger cities.\nThe focus is on social alternatives, rather than discipline, since restrictions are virtually impossible to uphold in a contemporary home, parents maintain.\n''Parents don't have much power anymore,'' conceded Toby Jesurum of Stamford, who has a 17-year-old daughter, Esther. ''If they take away the use of the car, the kids will just ride in someone else's for a few weeks. If they take away pocket money, the kids can always make it up by taking jobs like baby-sitting. And if you just tyrannize your child into submission, you may end up with a serious personality problem. The child never grows up.''\nOthers maintain that tighter controls only add to the overall sense of confrontation and rebellion that traditionally exists during the teen- age years.\n''I've found that restrictions like curfews create nothing but trouble,'' said Mary Lou Cantrell, president of the Parent-Teacher Association at New Canaan High School and the mother of five children. ''They become a bone of contention. They actually encourage a child to stay out late just to use up the time.''\nTeen-agers say that potentially dangerous situations often erupt because of pent-up frustrations over lack of options, especially in smaller communities. The problem is compounded, they add, now that teen-agers are excluded by law from bars.\nEven acceptable activities, such as an evening at an skating rink, is becoming a rarity because escalating liability insurance is forcing many rinks to close.\n''We have no McDonald's in town, no pizza place, not even an arcade,'' said Tom Maglisceau, 18, a senior at New Canaan High School. ''And most of us don't have the gas or the money to go a distance.''\nSo many of his friends, he said, end up spending an evening gathered at a parking lot behind a gas station, drinking or taking drugs for lack of other entertainment.\nWeston became one of the first of the smaller towns in the area to organize a teen center. Known as Weston's Union, it was established in 1982 by a group of parents to offset their children's constant complaint about ''nothing to do.'' The experience of the organizers is now providing an important lesson for other towns.\nThe center, in a building donated by the town's Board of Education, caters to youngsters from the 9th through the 12th grade. Operating expenses are approximately $20,000 a year, most of which comes from membership fees of $15 a person per semester, $5 door charges for nonmembers, parent donations and profits from the snack bar, said the volunteer director, Diane Lederer. The center is normally open on Friday and Saturday nights.\nThe center had no problem attracting youngsters during the first year of operation, when it was considered a novelty, Mrs. Lederer said. But the regular program of dancing and movies soon began to loose its appeal, particularly as no liquor was served. To rekindle interest the executive board was expanded last year to include 30 students as well the supervising adults.\n''The students helped spread the word and brought around friends,'' she said, adding that the teen-agers are also much more in tune with what their peers want from a social center.\nThe new board has also decided to organize a special event at least once a month this winter: Plans include more live band concerts and disk jockeys, a talent show, an outdoor block party during warmer weather and an ice-cream soda night.\nNew Canaan opened a youth center based on the Weston model a year ago at the local Y.M.C.A. One of the concerns, said Edwin Maclisceau, the vice president, was that it would end up being mostly 9th and 10th graders who would use it, not the older students who had cars.\nBut the organizers have found, he said, that if they can make the atmosphere and the programs sufficiently appealing - with pool tables, conversation areas, live bands and special events, the students will keep coming back.\n''We've had a very strong showing by the older kids,'' he said. ''They are hanging in there.''\nAfter polling 4,000 youngsters in the 7th to 12th grades and finding that 86 percent were eager for the opportunity, Greenwich now plans to offer something similar within a year or two.\nGetting parents to pledge as a group not to allow unsupervised parties in their homes is another idea gaining ground. This way, teen-agers cannot play one set of parents against another by insisting that ''nobody else does that.'' The idea is known as ''Safe Homes.''\nGreens Farms Academy in Wesport has been doing this now for two years. Nan Ruben, one of the parent volunteer organizers, said they have managed to get about 150 parents of children from grades 5 to 12 to agree to sign the pledge. It is mailed to all parents of children in the school, and repeated each September.\nMr. Maclisceau of New Canaan said more parents should take a greater interest in the athletic interests of their youngsters. Often the teen-agers become discouraged and drop out too swiftly, he said, due to a temporary setback, such as not making a particular team, or lack of enthusiasm about a particular achievement by a parent. Athletics, he said, are a particularly positive leisure-time acitivity.\nIndividually, parents are adding other initiatives. For instance, Ellen and Alfred Camhi of Stamford have been encouraging their son, Glen, 17, to bring friends back to the house by making sure their large basement room is attractive to youngsters. The room has been carpeted, decorated with streamers and furnished with a Ping-Pong table, pool table and stereo. Mrs. Camhi provides snacks and soda.\n''The key is wanting those friends in the house,'' she said. ''Too many parents complain about the noise and the mess. But it's better to have them hanging out in the house than on the street.''\nNo alcohol or drugs are allowed. But this does not seem to be a deterrent, said Glen.\n''If that's what they want, they have to find it someplace else,'' he said. ''Most of us just want somewhere to meet. I know because often I get calls from kids asking to come over even when I'm not planning to invite anyone.''
917	LITCHFIELD COUNTY TACKLES ITS HOUSING WOES	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D91E3BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: LITCHFIELD COUNTY, increasing known as a place for wealthy weekend residents, is becoming more and more strained to provide housing for its low- and moderate-income residents, many of whom grew up in the county but can no longer afford to live there.\nLITCHFIELD COUNTY, increasing known as a place for wealthy weekend residents, is becoming more and more strained to provide housing for its low- and moderate-income residents, many of whom grew up in the county but can no longer afford to live there.\nThe lack of affordable housing ranges from renters who cannot find apartments for under $500 to first-time homebuyers who look in vain to find something they can afford in the region. And it includes elderly people who would like to sell their homes and move into congregate housing, and single mothers who search for apartments with reasonable rents where their children will be welcome.\nCommunity groups have banded together to tackle the problem, and a few have been successful in getting some affordable housing built. But they acknowledge that they have a long way to go in dealing with a problem that one local leader described as ''never going to go away.''\nCompounding the problem is a negative image of affordable housing. There have been protests in some areas where such projects have been proposed.\n''It's a ticklish problem,'' said William A. Wilbur, the First Selectman in Sharon, where a panel is studying how the town could build such housing. ''A lot of people are afraid when you talk about low-income housing that you are segregating a certain class of people. We don't want to build something and put a 'low-income housing' stigma on it. We want this to be a fully acceptable part of the town.''\nA recent survey ranked affordable housing second only to transportation among the needs of residents of New Milford and the nearby communities of Litchfield, Bantam, Morris and Goshen.\n''We don't have people sleeping in doorways,'' said William J. Marchand, president of the United Way of Torrington, which helped sponsor the survey. ''It's a quiet problem.''\nThe survey showed that the price of an average home in Litchfield County had climbed from $84,800 in 1984 to $106,400 in 1985. Although the survey did not include rental housing, this cost has also risen, Mr. Marchand said, as as the rental stock became scarcer. For example, in downtown Torrington, he noted, many large houses have been converted into professional offices.\nThe need for affordable housing throughout the county is called ''critical'' by Kevin Brophy, supervising attorney for Connecticut Legal Services, based in Torrington.\n''I get 40 to 60 calls a month about housing and most of that is from people having problems paying rent,'' Mr. Brophy said. The problem has drawn concern from town officials, members of the clergy, social service professionals and business people. Much of the county is rural and has long suffered from a lack of rental housing, they point out, but the situation worsened when land values began to spiral upwards, making all forms of real estate, including apartments, increasingly expensive.\nIn New Milford a newly formed group, the New Milford Affordable Housing Corporation, is seeking solutions, said Rabbi Norman Koch, its president. But since the problem affects a range of people, from those who are classified as poor to those of higher incomes who want to purchase homes, the group is looking at both the cost of rental apartments, which have risen to more than $400 a month, and the cost of single-family houses, which now sell for $200,000 to $300,000 ''with no end to the boom in sight,'' Rabbi Koch said. ''This is a long-term problem,'' he said. ''It's not the kind of thing where you could build a housing project and the problem would be solved. The problem is not going to go away.''\nOne aspect of the group's work will be in the area of public relations, to persuade other townspeople that affordable housing is a benefit to the community. When the housing corporation started looking into building a 30- to 40-unit low-income complex on a town-owned parcel of land, ''the next thing you knew, we had a neighborhood association formed to stop construction,'' Rabbi Koch said. ''Construction? We had not even decided on the project; we were just looking into whether it was feasible. But people got up in arms.'' ''Maybe I'm naive and wide-eyed, but I'm an optimist who thinks you can build nice complexes,'' he said. ''People tend to throw up images of projects and feel that low-income means slums. I, for one, do not believe that's true.''\nThe New Milford group is a varied lot, ranging from Patricia Purdy, the town's director of social services, to John Harker, the mill manager of Kimberly Clark, a manufacturer of household products that is a major area employer.\nMs. Purdy said she sees a large number of clients, many of them single women with children, who cannot afford adequate housing.\n''Many of our apartments have been converted to condominiums or, if there are apartments, the demand is so high that rentals, which used to go for $250, are now $400 to $500, and pay has not escalated to that extent,'' she said.\nAs a result, many single mothers are crowding into apartments with friends or family members. They include women who have lived in New Milford all their lives, as well as those who married here but are now divorced. Because of the housing situation, some may be forced to move from New Milford. Ms. Purdy does not believe this will benefit the community.\n''If you are going to have a good, healthy community you need to have people of all incomes and backgrounds,'' she said. ''They say America is a melting pot. I saw that when I came to New Milford 25 years ago. I saw a lot of people who were immigrants, a lot of blue-collar people and a lot of professionals. There was real mix. I think we're losing that now.''\nAmong Ms. Purdy's clients is Sherry Smart, age 20, who, with her 4-month-old daughter, lives with her mother. Both she and her mother would like their own apartments, but cannot find affordable ones.\n''I've been looking for about a year,'' Ms. Smart said. ''I've looked in newspapers, I've looked all over. I'll have to stay right where I am until I find something.''\nIn hunting for an apartment, Beverly Nickerson, 31, finds, over and over, ''either they want too much money, or they don't want kids.''\nMrs. Nickerson, who is divorced, shares living quarters with her four children, her mother and two of her sisters and their children.\n''Apartment hunting is terrible,'' she said. ''I need three bedrooms because of the kids. I started looking two years ago and I still haven't found anything. You can get rents if you want to move to Danbury but I don't want to. I've lived here all my life.''\nRobin Glode, 25, who works as a secretary in Danbury, lived in a trailer with her five children until the trailer was sold. She and her husband, Michael, ''could pay about $600 a month, but rents are about $850 and they don't want kids,'' she said.\nPeople like Mrs. Glode worry Mr. Harker, who fears that New Milford's pool of employees will shrink if workers cannot find affordable housing.\nKimberly Clark, which employs about 1,250 people, is concerned because it wants to be able to transfer employees from its Middle West plants to New Milford. But single-family houses here cost far more than they do in Wisconsin, where most of the company's employees work, so such transfers are becoming more difficult, Mr. Harker said.\nSalisbury, Sharon and Cornwall are also facing housing difficulties, officials there say. But in Salisbury, one complex is closeto construction, and town officials are looking at the possibility of another.\nThe first project got under way about two years ago, when a group of townspeople became concerned about the lack of affordable housing in their rural community. They formed the Salisbury Housing Committee Inc., which is about to undertake the construction of Sarum Village, a 16-unit apartment complex that will be open to families earning less than $23,500 annually. The town's Planning and Zoning Committee approved it last month, and the group has applied for a $702,151 low-interest loan from the Farmers Home Administration, which is expected to be approved soon, said Pauline Galbreath, a loan technician with the agency. The State Bond Commission has approved a grant of $217,526 to help with site improvements, said Richard Cofrancesco of the State Department of Housing.\nThe decision to build the housing came about because ''there was a broad consensus in town that since property values were going up so astronomically, the town would lose a certain viability if young people couldn't find housing,'' said Edward McDonald, vice president of the Planning and Zoning Committee.\n''The town had been a working community in the past, but what with the whittling away of the dairy farms and more and more weekenders coming here, the complexion of the town had changed,'' he said. ''Our feeling was we wanted to see people living here who couldn't afford to do it'' on their own.\nSarum Village will be located on about eight acres of land in the center of town. There already is a waiting list for the units, Mr. McDonald said.\nSalisbury is looking at other possibilities as well, said First Selectman Charlotte H. Reid, among them a 14-acre tract donated to the town and now part of a 36-acre park. Mrs. Reid said she would like to see housing there that could accommodate first-time home-buyers.\n''I'm concerned that young couples are being priced out of the market,'' she said.\nCornwall formed a panel several months ago to study the housing issue ''and raise all the problems, which is very easy to do,'' said First Selectman Patsy Van Doren. That group has formed a nonprofit corporation that would enable it to build housing itself.\nThe Rev. Peter Hammond, pastor at the First Church of Christ and a member of the study panel, found there were three specific problem areas in Cornwall: the high price of homes, the lack of low-income housing and the lack of housing for the elderly.\nA survey in Cornwall showed that, over the past year, the average sale price of a house was $200,000, Mr. Hammond said. Such prices are unattainable for persons with moderate means, ''even those with moderate incomes of up to $30,000, so there is a very strong demand in Cornwall for that kind of housing,'' he said.\nWhile Cornwall ''does not have a large number of people in need of low-income housing,'' he said, ''we do have some, and where there is a need for it, it is a very significant need.''\nThe problem with the elderly ''is not necessarily a function of income,'' Mr. Hammond said. ''There are many people living here who would like to sell their big old boats of houses and live in a congregate situation.''\nAt present, the group will probably focus on moderate-income housing, ''but we don't want to lose sight of the other needs,'' he said.\nIn Sharon, a new study panel has been charged with giving town officials ''a definite course of action,'' said Mr. Wilbur, the First Selectman.\nThe need for affordable housing became an issue in Sharon last fall, when some farm hands were faced with homelessness when a farm went out of business, said the Rev. Phil West, pastor at the Sharon United Methodist Church. Since then, an agreement has been worked out that will enable the workers to live on the farm until June, but the situation demonstrated the lack of affordable housing in Sharon, he said.\n''I came here from New York City in 1975 and I've watched the same kind of gentrification in Sharon that I saw in Brooklyn Heights,'' Mr. West said. ''I've seen houses owned by a widow bought and resold for two and three times the price. The effect is to see famlies who have been part of the community for years forced to move away.''\nAs in other Litchfield County communities, some of the newcomers are people who work in New York City during the week, and commute to this region to enjoy weekend homes. The housing demand from this group is partly responsible for pricing out others, Mr. West said.\n''I'm not critical of the weekenders, but they're not coming here to man the volunteer fire department,'' he said.\nAnd while Litchfield County has the reputation of being affluent, there is poverty here, Mr. West said, ''although it tends to be invisible or not highly visible. These are small houses on back roads.''\nBut recognizing a problem and taking action to solve it are two different things, Mr. Wilbur said.The town has convened boards to study the housing problem twice before, he said. Two years ago, a study board recommended easing zoning restrictions so that large homes could be made into several apartments. But because of the high cost of real estate, the new apartments ended up being very expensive, he said.
918	Excuses Go High Tech	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD91E3BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: TEACHERS have been noticing that the current generation of students is remarkably creative in devising excuses for absences, tardiness and missed work.\nTEACHERS have been noticing that the current generation of students is remarkably creative in devising excuses for absences, tardiness and missed work.\nThe increasing presence of computers in schools, for example, has given students several new reasons to cite for not finishing work. ''The computer has become the most fertile field for excuse-making,'' observes Jane Mallison, chairman of the English department at the Trinity School on Manhattan's Upper West Side. '' 'The printer broke.' 'I pushed the wrong button and erased the whole thing.' 'We had a blackout.' Those are the most common excuses now.''\nMany students still rely on that traditional favorite, the household pet. Says Edward F. Duncanson, a science teacher at Crispell Middle School in Pine Bush, N.Y., ''I just had a note from a student's mother saying the dog ate his homework.''\nOther children, however, perhaps tired of such cliches, have invented fantastic tales. LeRoy E. Hay of Manchester High School in Manchester, Conn., reports his favorite such sequence:\nA student told his teacher that he was making his way to school along a quiet suburban road when he was suddenly blinded by a flash of bright light. When the boy regained his sight he was stunned to behold a flying saucer. Some creatures got out of the glowing space machine and, in perfect English, asked him what he was doing. When the student explained that he was on his way to school, the space creatures left him unharmed, but they took his homework. ''They said they were doing a study of human education and wanted my homework as a sample,'' the student said.\nStudents from big cities have their own variation on the flying-saucer theme: A student is making his way to school when he is confronted by street toughs. In imperfect English, they ask the boy what he is doing. When the student explains that he is going to school, the muggers leave him unharmed. But - you guessed it - they take his homework.\nTeen-agers have created a cult hero out of the title character of the movie ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off.'' Ferris not only dreams up extraordinary excuses, but usually gets away with them. But how well do excuses really work? Teachers want to believe their students, but they also do not want to be thought of as pushovers. ''Most of the time it depends on the student,'' Dr. Hay says. ''If you get one from a student who never makes an excuse, then you are more likely to believe him. You can buy anything once. But there are some students you just know are making it up. You don't buy anything from them.'' BLACKBOARD NOTES
919	SOME FILMS ARE FINDING SAINTS AS COMPELLING AS SINNERS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D81F3BF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Hollywood has never had much faith in religion.\nHollywood has never had much faith in religion.\nA religious theme might be used as the pretext for a costume spectacle or a lighthearted comedy, but a truly religious story, one that examined the struggle of faith or the search for meaning in an often random, indifferent universe, was usually shunned. Sermons, Hollywood seemed to be saying, are meant for the pulpit, not the screen.\nIt comes as something of a surprise, therefore, that this season four films have been released that deal with explicitly religious themes or plots.\n''In general, it's the absence of religion in film that disturbs me,'' says the Rev. Robert Lauder, an associate professor of philosophy at St. John's University who writes about film. ''That four should appear within a month or two is very rare.''\n''Therese'' is a biographical film of an intense young French girl who becomes a Carmelite nun and eventually a saint. ''The Mission'' is the story of Jesuit missionaries who attempt to defend their jungle outpost and its Indian adherents against colonial forces and an equivocal church hierarchy seeking to shut it down. ''The Name of the Rose,'' is a detective tale of monks in a 14th-century Italian abbey trying to solve a murder. ''The Sacrifice'' is a film by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, who died last week, about a man who offers himself to God as a sacrifice to save the world from nuclear annihilation.\nIt only takes some generosity to include, among such recent films, the documentary ''Mother Teresa,'' about the work of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning nun. And at least one more religious film is in the offing. Woody Allen, many of whose films have had strong religious undercurrents, began shooting at the end of October on a serious drama. One of its motifs, he said in an interview, is ''the conflict between the scientific view of the meaning of the universe and the religious, unthinking faith view.''\nIt would probably be giving too much credit to the random forces that operate in the film industry to say Hollywood and foreign film makers have rediscovered religion. Nevertheless, several observers of the film industry believe that the confluence of so many new films about religion - a subject that has historically fallen flat at the box office - is probably tied to a resurgence in religious interest in this decade.\nMuch of this resurgence, a recent study by the nondenominational Hartford Seminary showed, is the result of baby boomers returning to churches and synagogues as they enter middle age, raise families and con-Continued on page 00 front questions about life, death and meaning that have confronted every generation.\n''I think not only in this country but elsewhere, people are looking to traditional standards of morality,'' said Annette Michelson, a professor of cinema studies at New York University and editor of the film magazine October. ''This dictates literary judgments as well as modes of behavior.''\nRoland Joffe, director of ''The Mission,'' says that there come moments in ''this strange industrial and artistic world of film'' when ''ideas are current and felt to be current,'' and we're at ''the bulge of that surf'' with religion.\n''People are asking questions about spirituality, about whether a purely material view of the world is sufficient,'' he said. ''Are we passing on an ethical structure to our kids, and if we've abandoned that, have we done them a disservice?''\nThe fact is that Hollywood and -with some notable exceptions - most foreign directors have not traditionally been drawn to religion as a major theme unless it could serve such a commercially defensible end as a vehicle for lush scenery, lavish costumes and dazzling special effects. ''If you take religion seriously, you have to step on people's toes, and if you step on people's toes, Hollywood doesn't want it,'' said Michael Gallagher, who for 10 years was a film critic for the National Catholic News Service.\nThat attitude has remained fairly constant over the decades, according to Father Lauder. ''There are isolated snatches where they have treated religion more seriously, where they do seem to be going for something deeper, but it has not changed significantly,'' he said, One director who has consistently struggled with religious themes is Mr. Allen. He has woven the subject through films as varied as ''Love and Death,'' ''Stardust Memories,'' his most recent ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' and even, he says, ''The Purple Rose of Cairo.''\nBecause Mr. Allen tends to make highly personal films, he can explore his particular interests, and the subject that is most important to him, he said, is the religious groping for faith and meaning, a theme, he says, that is far more compelling than politics and psychology. ''That to me is the only significant struggle,'' he said. ''Until you come to terms with that, everything else is putting Band-Aids on something.''\n''Everything,'' he continued, ''is based on that enormous fear and anxiety that human beings deal with, that sense of total bewilderment and total anxiety about mortality.''\nMr. Allen, who was raised in what he described as a moderately religious Jewish family, says he has no respect for conventional religions. Some of that attitude was evident in the satire of his last film, ''Hannah and Her Sisters,'' where the character played by Mr. Allen goes on a spiritual search and comes home with a slew of religious novelty items, including a gaudy holographic picture of Jesus, whose eyes shift expressions from saintly to sad.\n''But I do identify completely with individual human beings who have honest theological struggles,'' he said. ''Comedy can treat any subject and can treat religion because the suffering that one goes through in religious doubts and ambivalence is perfect meat for comedians.''\nWhat is or is not a religious film is a difficult matter to define. But Hollywood's treatment of religion seems to fall roughly into three categories. A religious theme is often used as the vehicle for a romantic or historical epic - ''The Robe,'' ''The Ten Commandments,'' ''King of Kings.'' In some of these films, action and spectacle are what the film is really about; some, such as ''Becket'' or ''A Man for All Seasons,'' contain considerable religious food for thought.\n''The Mission'' might be this year's best example of the epic religous film that wrestles with serious and contemporary theological themes. Written by Robert Bolt, who also wrote both the stage and screen versions of ''A Man for All Seasons,'' the movie considers whether oppression should be fought with weapons or with the power of goodness and love; how does one give one's life meaning and what is the appropriate role of the church in temporal affairs. Still, the film spends much of its energy on compelling and dramatic action - perilous climbs up a breathtaking waterfall and intricately choreographed scenes of fighting.\n''The nature of film is to dramatize conflict,'' Mr. Joffe said, explaining why he felt it was important to keep theological discussions as spare as possible. ''The purpose of the movie is to make people feel, and it is in that feeling that thought is opened up.''\nA second category might embrace those films where religious figures are the basis for a story, sometimes warm, sometimes somber, sometimes simply a rousing adventure. Films like ''Going My Way,'' or ''The Bells of St. Mary's'' may actually say little about religion and more about such shared American values as optimism and communal responsibility. ''Going My Way,'' where Bing Crosby plays a Roman Catholic priest, is, according to Father Lauder, a delightful picture, but not really a religious one, and Bing Crosby could as well have been a doctor. Similarly, ''The Name of the Rose'' is essentially a detective story in religious garb.\nFinally, there are films that on the surface are not religious at all, but touch on themes that are profoundly religious. ''Tender Mercies,'' ''Chariots of Fire,'' and even ''On the Waterfront'' are cited by Father Lauder and others as examples of Hollywood's religious sensibility at its best. ''Hannah and Her Sisters,'' where the character played by Mr. Allen comes, after much inner turmoil, to the conclusion that a world that can produce the Marx Brothers is one worth living in, would be last year's contender for that category.\n''Chariots of Fire'' is ostensibly about a battle for glory between two English sprinters, but according to Father Lauder, it is ''a great religious film.'' One sprinter is a Scottish minister who runs because he feels the pleasure of God in his swiftness. The other is a Jewish student at Cambridge who runs because he must show a bigoted world that he can perform as well as anyone. Both sprinters win their races, but while the minister savors the gratification of his cheering friends, the other runner, at the film's end, seems ambivalent about his triumph. The Scottish minister also refuses to race on Sunday - despite appeals by the king -because it is his sabbath. He thereby wins an inner victory.\nA fourth category - the film that genuinely grapples with religious questions - is one Hollywood seems to have avoided. One must go abroad, to the works of such directors as Fellini and, most notably, Ingmar Bergman, to find such films. Starting with ''The Seventh Seal'' in 1956, and continuing through such films as ''Through a Glass Darkly,'' and ''Cries and Whispers,'' the Swedish director has replayed one theme, according to Father Lauder.\n''Simply stated that theme is the struggle of human beings to communicate love in a world in which God is silent,'' Father Lauder has written. ''The meaning and value of that struggle are made precarious for Mr. Bergman by the presence of death.''\n''When we are in Mr. Bergman's world,'' he notes, ''the presence of God - or the presence of God's absence - is overpowering.'' Some of the critics who reviewed Mr. Tarkovksy's film, ''The Sacrifice,'' which was made in Sweden, noted the Bergmanesque qualities in its themes and its use of symbolism.\nFrantisek Daniel, dean of the School of Cinema and Television at the University of Southern California, says Hollywood does not make serious religious films because producers don't think such films are what the audience wants. ''You have to ask the producer and the audience,'' he said. ''Do they want, do they need pictures that would help to clarify these basic questions: where are we, what are we doing here, why do we live, whom do we respond to, what is human conscience all about?''\n''Hollywood deals more with the myth than with the substance of religion,'' he said. ''You have this paradox, which is connected with the medium. If there is a mass medium, then people want to see stories. If the stories were to elucidate essential questions of human existence, if they are attractive enough, you can find producers who will put money into it. But when it is disturbing, when it makes people aware of those bothering questions, then people shy off. They don't want to deal with it.'' Mr. Joffe recalls that when he first tried to interest backers in ''The Mission,'' he was told: '' 'Who's interested in three priests in the jungle?' and 'This might do for an art house, but I don't think the man in the street is interested.' ''\nDavid Brown, a partner in the producing firm of Zanuck/Brown Company, rejects this view of Hollywood, noting that in more than 30 years he has developed such films as ''A Man Called Peter'' and ''I'd Climb the Highest Mountain.'' Those films and inspirational costume epics like ''The Robe,'' were, he acknowledged, ''theatrical, but isn't religion theatrical? Take the evangelists Jimmy Swaggart and Pat Robertson. When you look at them they might as well be actors. They manipulate their audience, build them to a fever pitch. There's nothing wrong with that.'' The problem today, he said, is that few books or screenplays dealing with religion cross his desk. ''I can't make a case against religious films except they have to be entertaining just as an evangelist has to be entertaining,'' he said.\nFather Lauder, however, says that even when the challenge of doing a religious film is tried, ''they go astray because whoever is writing or directing doesn't have any insight into the nature of religion or faith or religious vocations. Sometimes the religious character comes off as pious or otherworldly or ethereal.'' The other problem, he says, is that Hollywood finds difficulty in ''dramatizing the struggle of faith.''\nIn ''Therese,'' the sober theme of Therese's deep reverence in the face of suffering is underscored by the film's dominant brown and green tints and the whispered, echoic dialogue. The passion of Therese's lifelong commitment as a nun is captured in scenes and phrases that have a keen sensual, almost sexual, quality. Still, one wonders whether the film's cloistered setting - there is scarcely an outdoor scene - and almost exclusive focus on religious passion will be accepted by a broad audience. Indeed, the movie's distributors chose to show it to a selective audience, scheduling it into the Lincoln Plaza Theater, where it sold $17,436 worth of tickets in its first week, a figure its makers say pleases them.\nIn ''The Mission,'' which grossed about $3 million in its first six weeks in a few selected cities, Mr. Joffe includes a haunting scene where an Indian boy sings a hymn in front of a visiting cardinal. The scene tries to capture the tension Mr. Joffe feels about the value of proselytizing. Some people seeing the boy, Mr. Joffe observes, will think that the singing is a distortion of the boy's native culture. ''But then could that boy sing in that way, if he didn't have a spiritual understanding?'' he says.\nThe need to find effective cinematic language to tell a religious story is part of the reason some film authorities feel movies have been timid about dealing with religion. Theater, though it also shies away from the theme, can deal better with religious themes because ''it is a verbal medium,'' says Mr. Daniel. Indeed, many religious pictures are adapted from plays, such as the recent ''Mass Appeal'' and ''Agnes of God.''\nTheater's roots were in religion, beginning with the dramas of Greece and continuing through the medieval passion and morality plays. Theatrical offerings often existed as part of a religious rite, but the movies, Mr. Daniel observes, were created as a form of popular entertainment. ''It was always magic, more than a religious experience,'' he said. What the Critics Said\nThis season four films have opened that deal with explicitly religious themes or plots. They are ''Therese,'' ''The Mission,'' ''The Sacrifice'' and ''The Name of the Rose.'' The documentary ''Mother Teresa,'' about the Nobel Prize-winning nun, was also released. Following a summary of what The New York Times critics had to say about each film.\n''Theresa'': Alain Cavalier's ''cool, unsentimental, astonishingly handsome'' story of the life of St. Therese of Lisieux, wrote Vicent Canby, ''is one of those rare films whose visual beauty is not ornamental or a substitute for something else.''\n''The Mission'': The film, which won the grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival, ''is a singularly lumpy sort of movie,'' Vincent Canby wrote. It is ''a lesser variation on the kind of stately, important movie'' exemplified by a ''A Man for All Seasons,'' with ''a load of scenes that state points without dramatizing them.''\n''The Sacrifice'': ''A stunningly beautiful film that holds your attention even while you feel slightly stunned, in a less welcome way, by what is actually going on,'' wrote Walter Goodman. The director, Andrei Tarkovsky, ''owes a lot to two veterans of the Ingmar Bergman troupe, Sven Nykvist, who did the photography, and the actor Erland Josephson, who manages at moments to achieve the sense of profundity for which the movie strives.''\n''The Name of the Rose'': The adaptation of Umberto Eco's best seller, Vincent Canby wrote, is ''lightweight and lugubrious.'' The movie is ''full of the kind of atmosphere that can be created by elaborate sets, dim lighting and misty landscapes, though it has no singular character or dominant mood.''\n''Mother Teresa'': An ''appropriately modest, plain, commonsensical film,'' wrote Vicent Canby. The film makers ''honor their subject without turning her into a sentimental icon.'' The film is mostly about Mother Teresa's life today, ''and these sections are riveting, disturbing and occasionally funny.''

But Moses Pendleton, a founder of Pilobolus who started the smaller troupe, will now bring the lesser-known Momix into the city for a short season. The group performs Sunday (Jan. 4) through Wednesday at the Kaufmann Concert Hall in the YM- YWHA, 92nd Street and Lexington Ave.\nFormed by Mr. Pendleton as a creative vehicle for himself as a soloist, Momix has had shifting personnel in the past few years. Mr. Pendleton and Alison Chase are back directing the company, and Daniel Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, Ashley Roland and Morley Steinberg, former Momixites, are also on hand. One can expect the Pilobolus-type wit to surface in the 11 works on view in two programs. As son-of-Pilobolus, Momix is less collectively oriented than its predecessor.\nThe Joyce Theater, 19th Street and Eighth Avenue, offers a replay of its successful ''Sampler Festival'' from last year when Remy Charlip opens the series on Tuesday. Eleo Pomare's company performs on Wednesday, Marta Renzi's on Thursday and Ze'eva Cohen's on Friday of this first anthology week. All are modern dancers, and the range on view is wide. Mr. Charlip, a playful experimentalist who was in Merce Cunningham's first company in the 1950's, can also be solemn. Mr. Pomare is highly dramatic and Ms. Renzi and Ms. Cohen are capable of surprising us.\nCRITICS' CHOICES

The concert will be the Carnegie Hall debut of Turk Murphy's Jazz Band, which has been a fixture in San Frandisco for more than 35 years. It will also include Jim Cullum's Jazz Band from San Antonio, two members of a Chicago-based band, the Original Salty Dogs -the cornetist Lew Green and the drummer Wayne Jones - and the first New York appearance of a French group, the Hot Antic Jazz Band.\nMr. Murphy was the trombonist in Lu Watters' Yerba Buena Jazz Band, the group that was the center of the revival of traditional jazz on the West Coast in the 1940's. He started his own group in 1948; it remains today the longest-lived product of the traditional jazz revival. For many years Mr. Murphy played in his own club in San Francisco, Earthquake McGoon's, and for the past two years has been in the New Orleans Room of the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco.\nJim Cullum's Jazz Band was formed 25 years ago by Mr. Cullum's father, who had been a saxophonist in Jack Teagarden's orchestra before he retired to run the family wholesale-grocery business. When young Jim started playing cornet while he was in high school, his father's musical enthusiasm was rekindled and he organized a band of San Antonio businessmen that eventually played regularly at its own club, The Landing. When the elder Cullum died in 1973, his son, who had joined the band when he finished college, took over the leadership.\nThe Hot Antic Jazz Band specializes in jazz of the 1920's, particularly the music of the cornetist Jabbo Smith, who, in the late 20's, rivaled Louis Armstrong in popularity. In addition to their appearance at Carnegie Hall on Saturday, the French group will give New Yorkers a foretaste of their music in two performances on Thursday evening at 9 and 11 at the Universal Jazz Coalition's Jazz Center, 380 Lafayette Street.\nCRITICS' CHOICES

An offshoot of the long-established Zabriskie Gallery at 724 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, it brought to the French capital the work of leading American photographers, while at the same time mounting shows devoted to Europeans. And it sparked the inclusion of photography in the exhibition roster of the parent gallery in New York.\nNow, in celebration of the Paris branch's 10th anniversary, the Zabriskie Gallery here is presenting ''French Photography,'' an elegant display of prints from the stock of both galleries and from the personal collection of their proprietor, Virginia Zabriskie. Meanwhile, the Paris gallery is presenting an updated version of its 1976 inaugural show, ''Ten American Contemporary Photographers.''\nAlthough in her catalogue introduction Miss Zabriskie describes herself as having been a ''debutante'' in the field 10 years ago, the rich and varied assemblage of ''French Photography'' attests to the ''eye'' she has developed for top-flight work, particularly for artists of Surrealist persuasion. There are such gems here as Man Ray's 1936 photograph of a Venus torso evocatively tied with rope; a collage by Georges Hugnet of two women whose starry-eyed repose is threatened by a locomotive roaring out of the sea, and Germaine Krull's quintessentially Parisian ''La Mome Bijou,'' c. 1932, a hard-bitten madame who seems to wear on her chest and fingers the entire contents of a jewelry store.\nIt's a stimulating exhibition, of well-known work and affecting discoveries. And it confirms that the Zabriskie move 10 years ago to partner photography with painting and sculpture was a wise one. Through Jan. 17.\nCRITICS' CHOICES

It is nearly impossible to imagine life in the state without Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Newark Symphone Hall, Y.M.C.A. camps, New Brunswick Tomorrow, Planned Parenthood and the Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange.\nNonprofit organizations perform total services in our communities. As Federal support has declined, the gap has been filled largely by nonprofit groups providing services at low or no cost, in contrast to the full costs of Government programs.\nCommunity volunteer agencies run by community residents are more responsive and more effective in meeting community needs.\nAs independent organizations, nonprofits are free to explore and innovate, and to fight inequality and injustice. They can advocate controversial causes, undertake unpopular projects and espouse minority viewpoints. They perform valuable watchdog functions, monitoring both business and government.\nNonprofits meet a deep-rooted need of people to work together, to do good. The paid and volunteer workforce of New Jersey's nonprofit agencies are motivated by organizational aims, and by personal goals as well.\nA recent study sponsored by the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company of Newark discovered that volunteering had unexpected benefits: people involved in volunteer activities are more-satisfied, more-productive employees.\nA study commissioned by the Center for Non-Profit Corporations reveals significant and surprising characteristics of the New Jersey nonprofit sector. The most compelling characteristic is diversity.\nSeventy-five percent of the nonprofit organizations in New Jersey fall into the nonreligious service category. Health, education and social services predominate. Institutional and residential care, housing, community development and recreation are also strongly represented.\nBased on 1982 data, the latest year for which figures are available, New Jersey nonprofits employed an estimated 280,000 full-time workers. This figure represented 9 percent of the state's local civilian workforce, double the 124,000 people employed in the chemical manufacturing industry and more than one and a half times the 165,000 employed in finance, insurance and real estate.\nAlso based on the same data, the average nonprofit organization in New Jersey has eight employees and benefits from the unpaid services of 13 volunteers a month. It is estimated that, on a monthly basis, 332,000 New Jerseyans volunteer their services to nonprofit agencies.\nEach month, more than 8 percent of the state's population of 7 million supports nonprofit organizations through paid or volunteer services.\nNew Jersey's nonprofit sector is well established. About 80 percent of the organizations have been in operation between 8 and 20 years, 50 percent are more than 20 years old and 20 percent are more than 60.\nNew Jersey's nonprofit sector also has a strong local orientation. Fifty-eight percent of the nonprofit organizations serve a single neighborhood, municipalilty or county, whereas only 25 percent have a statewide or broader base.\nMost of New Jersey's nonprofit organizations serve a relatively small number of clients. Thirty percent serve fewer than 100 individuals annually, 30 percent serve from 100 to 732 and 30 percent between 732 and 10,000. Only 10 percent of the agencies serve more than 10,000 people in one year.\nIn 1982, total revenues of the New Jersey nonprofit sector amounted to $6.5 billion and total assets exceeded $7.2 billion. However, this capital was highly concentrated among a small segment of the nonprofit sector; half of the nonprofit agencies has revenues under $70,000 and assets of less than $90,000.\nNew Jersey nonprofits receive most of their income form the following sources: 21.7 percent from fees for service, 17 percent from individual donations, 10.9 percent from the Federal Government, 10.8 percent from membership dues, 8 percent from the state government, 7.1 percent from corporate and philanthropic foundations and 5.6 percent from federated campaigns, such as United Way.\nFifty-five percent of all funds received by the nonprofits come from individuals - through dues, fees and contributions. New Jersey's nonprofits have an estimated 4.5 million dues-paying members.\nAll these figures, however, ignore variations in income source among different segments of the nonprofit sector. For example, human service nonprofit organizations rely more heavily on government funds than do others.\nThe New Jersey nonprofit sector is vitally important to the quality of life in the state. State policies can either contribute to or undermine the health of nonprofit organizations. Although the effects of recent overhaul of the Federal tax policy are yet to be seen, there is little question that nonprofit organizations will be affected.\nChanges in state tax policy also will have planned and unanticipated consequences for nonprofits.\nIn November, I testified before the State and Local Expenditure and Revenue Policy Commission on behalf of New Jersey's nonprofit sector. I recommended state tax policy that allows personal deduction of charitable contributions and encourages, through deductions or tax credits, corporate support of nonprofit agencies.\nI also recommended the review of all policies for inadvertent discrimination against nonprofit employees, as is the current case with tax-sheltered annuities.\nFinally, I recommended that state policy allow nonprofit agencies to seek creative means to maintain their independence.\nThe nonprofit organizations serving New Jersey reflect the character of thestate; they are small and very locally oriented. As such, they require supportive state policies to maintain their viability and vitality, and, in turn, the quality of life in New Jersey.\nNEW JERSEY OPINION

Larson, an East Hartford Democrat who will be the President pro tem of the State Senate.\n''I think it's going to be a very exciting and productive couple of years,'' said Irving J. Stolberg, a New Haven Democrat who will be back as Speaker of the House of Representatives after being on the sidelines the last two years as minority leader while the Republicans ran the legislature.\n''It's a lot easier with majorities than with minorities,'' Mr. Stolberg said.\nThe opening day of a new legislature by tradition is more for ceremony than substance. All 151 Representatives and 36 Senators will be sworn in for two-year terms. Governor O'Neill and the five other Democrats who were re-elected or elected to statewide office on Nov. 4 will take their oaths of office for four-year terms. At a joint session of the legislature, Mr. O'Neill will deliver his State of the State address, outlining his legislative goals for the new session.\nOnce the opening formalities are completed, legislators will spend the next five months grappling with a host of issues that have dominated the legislative agenda in recent years, such as:\n* How to spend the state's budget surplus, currently estimated at $142 million, and provide property tax relief to the cities and towns?\n* Should Connecticut be opened to full interstate banking instead of restricting mergers to banks within New England?\n* What changes should be made in legislation adopted last year to raise the starting salaries of public school teachers and to make liability insurance more affordable by limiting damage awards by the courts?\nDealing with these questions will be sizable Democratic majorities in both houses and an influx of new legislators. The Democratic margins will be 92 to 59 in the House and 25 to 11 in the Senate. Of the 92 Democratic Representatives, 38 are newly elected, as are 13 of the 25 Democratic Senators, although a few of the new lawmakers had prior service in the legislature.\n''You've got an energetic and creative legislature, particularly in the freshman class in both the House and the Senate,'' Mr. Stolberg said in an interview. ''I think the Governor's job, and my job and John Larson's job will be to channel a lot of that creativity into productive channels, and I think we're going to work together very well to do that.''\nMr. Larson, in a separate interview, said that he and Mr. Stolberg were in agreement on many issues, had jointly announced the Senate and House co-chairmen of the legislature's existing committees, and were forming new special committees to study statewide problems, such as housing, drug abuse and conditions in the workplace.\n''It will just be a question of coming together,'' Mr. Larson said. ''We've had a very good relationship in the past with the Governor. We look for that communication to be expanding and being better.''\nFor the first time in recent memory, Mr. Larson said, the Democrats will control both houses of the legislature and the Governor's office at a time when the state is running a surplus.\n''That presents us with an opportunity,'' Mr. Larson said, noting that Democratic leaders were seeking to set schedules that would allow the legislature to complete its work more efficiently and minimize the usual last-minute crush of legislation at adjournment, as well as an agenda that he said would demonstrate fiscal restraint.\nHe said that all 187 legislators would probably have different ideas on how to spend the state's growing surplus, but that most Democratic Senators agreed with Mr. O'Neill that the state should seek to aid the municipalities in holding down or reducing local property taxes.\nMr. Larson said he did not favor looking for major cuts in state taxes as of now.\n''We don't know when the downturn in the economy is going to take place, but we know that certainly is inevitable,'' he said. ''We want to prepare for that eventuality.''\nMr. Stolberg also said ''a major focus'' would be on local property-tax relief, although he said there was ''a possibility'' of some other tax reductions.\nWhile some legislators view Mr. Stolberg as more liberal in his views than Mr. O'Neill, Mr. Stolberg said that he and the Governor were in agreement on most issues.\n''Bill and I have worked well by necessity in the past, and increasingly with a commitment to common goals,'' Mr. Stolberg said. ''It's interesting that if you talk to him and you talk to me, you find that probably our top four or five goals for the next couple of years are the same - housing, drugs, aid to the cities and towns,'' Mr. Stolberg said. ''Whether it's coincidence, or just working together, we've become more aware of the same kind of needs.''\nIn preparing for the new session, he said, ''I'm looking forward to it. You don't know how much. And not just because we're back in the majority, but because the quality of our caucus is so superb.''

Me?\nI have trouble with my sense of taste.\nOh, I can taste all right, but my palate can't seem to distinguish the nuances other people apparently enjoy.\nTake cheese, for example. My friends' eyes glisten when they talk about the different taste sensations of Roquefort, Brie, Camembert, Stilton, Cheddar and so on. To me, cheese is cheese.\nIn the land of subtle savors, my tongue is an ignoramus. My taste buds quiver only when shocked by something pungent, like a hot dog with all the trimmings.\nI became aware of my failing a long time ago, when I was in junior high school. Every Thursday afternoon, my class would take a trip to some point of interest in New York City.\nThe trip I remember particularly was one to the Stock Exchange. I don't recall much about the Exchange, but I do remember how hungry we all were after we emerged.\nWe had little more than return subway fare, but we pooled our pennies and in a nearby cafeteria bought as many slices of bread - plain rye bread - as we could. Clustered around a cafeteria table, we smeared each slice with mustard and ketchup, which were free.\nIt was delicious, and I still drool at the memory. So you see, I do have taste buds; it's just that they're not refined.\nI go to fine French, Italian and Chinese restaurants, but, although I like fine food, I like it, I'm afraid - because of my primitive sense of taste - for all the wrong reasons.\nLike Chinese egg rolls: I like them not so much for the filling as for the crispy fried crust, which I can dab with mustard.\nAnd boiled shrimp. I like them, too, but only because I can saturate them in a sauce spiced with Tabasco. And I like boeuf bourgignon only if the bread basket is filled with slices of crusty French bread. The same thing happens at home. There was the time that we had boiled beef for dinner and I discovered there was no horseradish in the house. Boiled beef without horseradish? I jumped into the car and raced to the supermarket for a jar of the stuff, knowing that the satisfaction I anticipated was not in the beef so much as in the tang of the horseradish.\nI find that I dream of corned beef sandwiches made with rye bread. I once went into a delicatessan for a corned beef sandwich and was told the rye bread had run out and would I want corned beef on white or whole wheat?\nCorned beef on white or whole wheat?? I stalked out in indignation. In truth, if the deli had been out of corned beef, I would almost have been content with the rye bread -with a generous application of mustard on it, of course.\nTalk about your Epicurean meals. Give me a sandwich made with fresh, crunchy rye bread and I don't care what filling you use.\nYou can put in tuna or cream cheese or peanut butter, and it'll be fine with me. If you have to, just give me the rye bread alone; I'll sink my teeth into it and chew it, reveling in the strong taste of the brown brittle crust and the rough-textured doughy center spiced with caraway seeds.\nMy wife, who is a gourmet with tastes that run to Quiche Lorraine and Coquilles Saint Jacques, does not approve of my plebeian palate.\nThe other day, we went to one of those restaurants that feature salad bars. I put a wedge of lettuce and five slices of rye bread on my plate and headed back to the table to enjoy my Lucullan feast.\nMy wife muttered bitterly that, if that was all I liked, she could easily prepare a perfect dinner for me: a loaf of rye bread and a few jars of mustard, ketchup and horseradish.\nI began to laugh, but then stopped, because I was suddenly struck by the thought that the combination did sound enticing, especially if I could slip in a sour pickle.\nSEAKING PERSONALLY

Illustrated. 611 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: A Bradford Book/The MIT Press.\n$27.50 each, $45 a set.\nIF there has been a scientific revolution in the study of mind, based on ideas of symbolic computation, the counterrevolution is coming into view. ''Parallel Distributed Processing'' presents important contributions to a new theory of cognition called ''connectionism.'' This theory assumes that the mind is a very large set of very simple elementary units connected with one another in a network. Mental processes are interactions between units that are individually simple but have complex results in the overall patterns that occur in the network. The term ''parallel'' refers to the assumption that units excite and inhibit each other throughout the network simultaneously - in parallel operations rather than in a sequence of operations. The term ''distributed'' refers to the assumption that knowledge consists of the connections between pairs of units that are distributed throughout the network rather than being stored in localized structures.\nConsidered in the short term - the last 15 years or so - the ideas represented in ''Parallel Distributed Processing'' fundamentally challenge the main concepts and assumptions of modern cognitive science. In the long term, these scientific developments promise to rebalance a debate that has traditionally been at the core of theoretical discussions about the mind, a debate that has been one-sided for two decades. The research program that currently dominates the study of complex mental processes is based on the idea of symbolic computation - the idea that knowledge and mental processes involve structures of symbols and transformations of symbolic expressions.\nA few cognitive scientists began developing models based on symbolic computation about 30 years ago when the dominant theoretical framework was a version of association theory involving connections between stimuli and responses. The theoretical approach based on symbolic computation was pioneered by Noam Chomsky in linguistics and Allen Newell, Herbert Simon and Marvin Minsky in computer science and psychology, and the major achievements of cognitive science in the 1970's and 80's have largely been developments of that idea. Connectionists - including James McClelland, David Rumelhart and the other authors of ''Parallel Distributed Processing'' - are developing a new form of association theory, thus reviving a longstanding debate. The issue is whether structure of information and mental organization should be assumed in psychological theories or whether theoretical assumptions should be limited to simple mental units and connections between them.\nAssociation theorists believe that complex cognition - such as understanding and using language, reasoning with and about abstract concepts and solving intellectual problems - should be explained in terms of elementary structures and processes. Theorists on the other side of the debate have argued that association theory is too simple to account for complex knowledge and thinking, and that structures of information and mental organization must be included in the assumptions of cognitive theory. The current proponents of complex assumptions use the idea of symbolic computation, but the debate goes back at least to Locke, who articulated an association theory in response to Descartes's doctrine about innate ideas, as well as to Kant, who responded to Hume's associationism with a view that fundamental intuitions of space, time and causality are present a priori.\nBefore word processors became common, many people thought of computers as dealing entirely with numerical calculation. In fact, computation is fundamentally a process that operates on symbols, and operations on the symbolic expressions of arithmetic and algebra are a special case of symbolic computation. An important advance of the 50's was the development of programming languages for manipulating symbolic expressions such as words, sentences and general formulas of language and logic. These programming languages - especially one called LISP (for list processing language) - have been used in the development of a theory of cognition in which mental processes are understood as processes of symbolic computation.\nAn impressive set of scientific achievements has been based on symbolic computation. Two important theoretical ideas are involved. One is that patterns of generic relations, or schemata, are used to organize information in specific situations. Another is that cognitive skills are composed of rules that can be repre-sented symbolically in the form, ''if this, then that.'' By assuming that knowledge has the form of schemata and that the ''if, then'' rules obtain, researchers have devel-oped models that simulate significant characteristics of human reasoning and problem solving.\nIn ''Parallel Distributed Processing,'' Mr. Rumelhart and Mr. McClelland played leading roles - they are authors or co-authors of 14 of the 26 chapters of this work - but authorship is divided among 16 psychologists, computer science mathematicians and neuroscientists who collaborated over a period of four years. These volumes do not present all the research topics that are currently being developed using parallel distributed computation - in particular, work on computational theories of vision is not included - but the research contributions presented here form an important collection that demonstrates the potential of connectionism to address fundamental questions in the theory of cognition.\nThe idea of symbolic computation became dominant by the mid-70's because the associationist ideas of the time were inadequate to explain complex human cognition, such as language and problem-solving. That the new connectionist idea is more powerful is shown by several chapters of ''Parallel Distributed Processing'' that provide analyses in areas where symbolic computation has been strongest. Although these researchers are in the early stages of their work, they present significant progress on several important topics, including understanding of sentences, learning past tenses of verbs and learning to classify individuals in categories. In symbolic computation theory, these are topics for which knowledge of schemata and the ''if, then'' rules are assumed to play essential roles, and models include symbolic representations of the schemata and rules. Connectionist networks do not contain representations of rules or schemata as such, and the analyses in ''Parallel Distributed Processing'' show how performance that seems to reflect knowledge of those things can in fact occur because there are connections in a network.\nConnectionist models also have some important advantages over models that are formulated as symbolic computation rules and data structures. Human perception and understanding are often effective in spite of information that is incomplete or ambiguous. Flexibility and use of multiple sources of information, which characterize much human cognition, have been difficult to simulate with symbolic computation. They are easier to represent in connectionist models, in which all processes are assumed to involve multiple and interacting factors.\nOne source of inspiration for connectionist theorizing is the possibility that these models may be more directly related to the brain mechanisms that underlie cognition than are models based on symbolic computation. A network of interconnected units that excite and inhibit one another is consistent with general characteristics of the brain cortex as it is now understood. For the most part, however, the analyses presented in these volumes use a neural analogy loosely, as the biologically oriented chapters acknowledge, although there are a few significant cases in which detailed relations between connectionist models and brain science have been worked out. The need for stronger theoretical connections between cognitive science and neuroscience is a major challenge, but not a reason to reject the scientific accomplishments of work like that reported here. The need for explanatory theories in psychology is suf-ficient to justify a major continuation of scientific efforts along the lines of these contributions. CONNECTIONISTS have many challenging tasks before them in the development of their new version of associationism. Sequential processes and reasoning with symbols are important aspects of cognition that have been clarified in symbolic computation theory but are difficult to incorporate into connectionism. ''Parallel Distributed Processing'' presents promising ideas that could lead to productive new insights on many difficult issues, but most of the work lies ahead. Connectionists have much to do to catch up with the substantial progress that has been made in symbolic computation theory on problems of symbolic reasoning, the understanding of language and other important topics.\nMany fundamental problems of cognition have not been addressed adequately by using models based on symbolic computation. As we proceed with work on these issues in the theory of cognition, we will be more productive because of the revival of an associationist side of the discussion. The contributions published in ''Parallel Distributed Processing'' represent connectionism's recent development as a promising line of research, and if future work is successful the results will constitute a major scientific achievement. The effort to explain the structures of information in human cognition, rather than merely to analyze and describe them, should be a major activity of cognitive science, especially cognitive psychology. That effort has been less salient lately than it deserves to be, and the promise of its revitalization is important - in the field and for its contribution to scientific knowledge at large.

Each puts the gods, the good, the false and the true in a different place. They cannot each be correct - there are too many counterclaims - yet society after society has sailed to greatness (not simply to the doom they also doomed themselves to) following these false charts, these fictions that have been projected upon the planet. And the planet, like the great screen of a drive-in movie, accepts them all, lighted by the illusions of passion, for as long as the passions last. If so, then our lives are made of fictions, beliefs we construct and then dwell in like a beach house in Malibu. When we change our life - one of the central themes of Philip Roth's magnificent new novel, a remarkable change of direction itself - we recreate ''a counterlife that is one's own anti-myth,'' as Mr. Roth's protagonist, Nathan Zuckerman, surmises.\n''Nothing is impossible,'' declares Mordecai Lippman, the fanatical Zionist of the novel, who, like the phoenix, practically invents himself out of ashes and heat. ''All the Jew must decide is what he wants - then he can act and achieve it.'' But first of all you must become a Jew, a root Jew, not merely a branch Jew like some bank in the suburbs. In novel after novel, Mr. Roth has asked what Jews want with somewhat the same irritated bewilderment we associate with Freud's question: ''What do women want?'' In ''The Counterlife,'' the query has become more riddling, more radical and, despite the antic flipflops of the plot, more serious yet no less witty for all that: can a Jew, if he wishes - if he wants -change into a Jew? And in what direction should he go to do that? And why should the quiet course of a comfortable life be shattered by such questions, which were always there to be put, but were answered by not being asked? And is not the anti-Semitism of a Jew the refusal of a Jew to be one?\nThese are a few of the questions Philip Roth's latest novel considers, turning them round like meat on a spit. With respect to his own past as an author, there are many questions - the hedges, qualifications, objections entertained by critics - to which it gives a resounding answer. ''The Counterlife,'' it seems to me, constitutes a fulfillment of tendencies, a successful integration of themes, and the final working through of obsessions that have previously troubled if not marred his work. I hope it felt, as Mr. Roth wrote it, like a triumph, because that is certainly how it reads to me. THE style is a triumph too. It is no longer a style at war with itself, as Mr. Roth's sometimes used to be, its cleverness undercutting its own emotions, its satire thinning a subject already sliced. Its combativeness is no longer pointed at the reader, the critic, the family or some other ancient adversary. The world of ''The Counterlife'' is made of intelligent, argumentative, witty, observant words. They are words woven now, after the practice of many years, into a rich, muscular, culturally complex style that even in purely narrative moments seems to come not from the end of a pen but through the flow of the voice, thus from a mouth - the organ that Zuckerman's brother, a dentist, seductively describes, for the young assistant he is about to hire, as genital. It is surely the opening through which, to continue life, the world is received. It is also, quite as surely, the loudspeaker of the soul. And in ''The Counterlife'' a lot of those loudspeakers are on. Full blast.\nThe book comes to us wrapped in more than its dust jacket. It continues and seems to conclude a series of affairs, ambitions and other anxieties taken from the life of Nathan Zuckerman; a life whose telling began before its tolling in ''The Ghost Writer'' of 1979, and which, after two more novels, ''Zuckerman Unbound'' in 1981, then ''The Anatomy Lesson'' in 1983, was advertised as ending in 1985 with the addition of a novella, ''The Prague Orgy,'' so that the entire collection could be called ''Zuckerman Bound,'' a volume you were encouraged to buy in the belief that at last you had hold of the whole thing. So our present text is legitimately preceded, if not surrounded, by the four books that carry the Zuckerman name to this point.\nHowever, Mr. Roth would now have us believe that Nathan Zuckerman is the invention of Peter Tarnopol, the professor and novelist of ''My Life as a Man.'' Tarnopol endeavors to come to some understanding of himself by composing a series of fictions that are then topped off by the real thing, Tarnopol's autobiography (which we should no more believe is true of Tarnopol than ''My Life as a Man'' is true of Mr. Roth). And this conjunction of fact with fancy presumably allows us to estimate the alterations imagination makes to any fictionalized biography. In a Roth novel, it is not unusual for characters to cross from one text to another as though they were crossing a street. Dr. Spielvogel, the psychiatrist of ''My Life as a Man,'' is also the analytic ear listening to Portnoy's complaint.\nNathan Zuckerman is the author of a notoriously dirty book, an alleged libel of the Jews, ''Carnovsky,'' which has made him both rich and reviled, just as ''Portnoy's Complaint'' made Philip Roth well known, well off and the target of slings. So if we follow this tangle from head to tail, we shall discover that Mr. Roth has created a character, Peter Tarnopol, who has in turn invented Nathan Zuckerman, who has, for his part, written the same book Mr. Roth has (since ''Carnovsky'' equals ''Portnoy''). This ring of real and fictive authors puts us at least a touch back, if not smack back at the beginning. It is consequently not stretching the facts but admitting them to say that ''The Counterlife'' is both thematically and structurally connected to the general body of Philip Roth's work.\nNor is this all. One of Philip Roth's preoccupations as a writer has been the relation between ''his life as a man'' and ''his life as a character''; between life in the world and life in his fictions; between the fictions Mr. Roth reads and the fictions Mr. Roth writes. Both the life and the work of a writer like Kafka are as real and resounding to Philip Roth the writer as any other element of his material. When Zuckerman imagines that a young woman he has just met and immediately fancies is not the ghostly author of ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' but Frank herself (a survivor as well as a victim of the camps, who has continued to play dead to enhance the influence of her book), we are not dealing simply with the perhaps absurd obsession of a character in a fiction.\nThe Zuckerman books are full of warnings to their readers about the differences, subtle sometimes, between real life and art: ''They [ those affected by the sex-mad Carnovsky ] had mistaken impersonation for confession and were calling out to a character who lived in a book.'' Zuckerman's anguish over this error is expressed too eloquently and too often to be merely his. But now we have crossed the line to lay the attitude of a fictional figure at its author's feet.\nIf ''the artist descends within himself,'' in those words of Conrad Zuckerman approvingly quotes, ''and in that lonely region of stress and strife . . . finds the terms of his appeal,'' then Mr. Roth does not go down so deeply that he loses sight of the salient facts of his life. His personal problems, particularly successes and sufferings, continue to preoccupy him. What Conrad clearly expected the artist to do was to descend beyond those particularities to a place where pride and anxiety and stamina and weakness could find new terms for their expression - locate the general, not the local, source of their appeal. DESPITE the author's disclaimers, the many parallels between the Zuckerman saga and the Philip Roth story invite the confusion. Part of ''The Anatomy Lesson,'' for instance, is a vengeful reply to a particularly stinging critical piece on Mr. Roth by Irving Howe. The identity of Mr. Howe is hidden like a lamppost in the living room. Another section is concerned to rebut the feminists. A reader ignorant of Portnoy's habits, unfamiliar with the critical climate, a reader for whom the author's name is merely that - short, an off rhyme with wrath - would be blessed by such ignorance, and possibly able to see the book, because this new work, like each of the others, is not only wrapped in Zuckerman and Tarnopol, it is also wrapped in Roth.\nIf you are a black writer, professional blacks (that is, people whose business is being black and little else) will require blackness of you, although each critic may favor a different shade; and if you are a woman, the feminists will make analogous demands, and hunt through every page looking for the incriminating pronoun and other signs you have succumbed to something macho; and if you are a Jewish writer it will be the same, though the quarreling groups will perhaps be more numerous and have been at it longer. Philip Roth has been praised by this group and damned by that, and charged and vindicated and hailed and cursed by readers whose real interests were as far from literature as fanaticism will always take you - to the opposite pole. It is a pole Mr. Roth stirs them up with.\nSo the Zuckerman chronicles continue. Nothing is changed. Every old quarrel has a home in this text. There are references, naturally, to previous books. We are still teased by details taken from the author's life and we are encouraged to search for more, while at the same time the fundamental connection is denied. Sexual expression, phallic power, oral fixation: each is present. Family oppression and familial duties: these too. But above all, there is the presence of the question of what it means to be a Jew. Nevertheless, everything has changed after all. These themes no longer possess our author. He has become their master.\nThe book begins with the brother's death. Henry, the dentist, has heart trouble. The medicine he is taking for it makes him impotent. Unable to sport with his hygienist any longer, Henry grows desperate and undergoes a bypass operation that will remove him from his medicine, restore his manhood and incidentally repair his heart. His wife chooses to believe it is for her he has run this risk. But soon Mr. Roth will skillfully split the narrative. Henry will unaccountably recover from his death at the hands of the text, and with his revived heart will hasten abruptly away to Israel to take up righteousness and seek the faith. There he will carry a pistol and develop a different, more martial, manhood. It is not heaven he has gone to but Judea. It is not the West Bank he has gone to, but War.\nWe learn that Nathan Zuckerman, Henry's nemesis, has refused to speak at his brother's funeral. For reasons, of course. Well, wait. Henry will get his opportunity to refuse to speak at Nathan's. These are counterlives but suspiciously parallel tales: woman against woman, marriage against marriage, both or neither brother surviving the knife, as the novel continues its surprises. For Nathan's story could be said to commence with his death, too, at a later date in the text, though from similar causes and resembling motives. Nathan has the same punning problem - a troubled heart -with its emasculating consequences, which means he cannot marry the sweet young object of his present affections and beget the child he finally thinks he wants. So he too will seek a remedy beneath the surgeon's knife and receive his quietus for it.\nFirst, Tale One must wag. (But both may belong to the same dog.) We follow Nathan as he follows Henry to Israel. There he receives doses of rhetoric from every mouth sufficient to cure complacency by killing it. Hope is killed as well. The European Jew speaks, the radical right-wing Jew speaks (he also speaks for the Arabs so as to have some worthy opposition). The anti-Semitic Jew speaks, the peaceful Jew speaks, the Furies have their innings. Like sound trucks in the street, through Nathan they holler wonderfully at one another. The arguments concern Jews, are about Jewishness, about power, and are wholly political. The political and the moral are artfully confused. So this is not a novel about ideas only, but about beliefs - those beliefs that, like bombs, we daily drop on one another. The speakers' rhetoric is their rifle. And the characters establish their character by means of their speech, through the defense, the advocacy, the oppressiveness of their opinions.\nThis speech does not turn back upon itself as Stanley Elkin's often does, nor are its rhythms so obviously Yiddish as Bernard Malamud's sometimes were, nor is it quite as continuously civilized as Saul Bellow's. It has an insistently forward push toward the next thought, the next feeling, a future desire; it does not normally dawdle in description, or stop for meditative poesy, or paralyze its movement with refinements and indecisions. In this it is urban, male (no matter the sex of the speaker), quick, artful yet blunt, overbearing, mean, street smart but worldly wise. In each case, it seems superb for its purposes and complete.\nEvery belief is buttressed, not with reasons, but with the crimes of opponents. The gentiles have done thus and so; the Arabs, also, have done thus and so; therefore we, the Jews, should do thus, and thus, and thus and so. Action follows action like an avalanche of rock. Of course resentment stretches as far as one can see sand. And every Jew, except for the secular, corrupt, pluralistic and skeptically minded Nathan, believes it essential that every Jew believe the same as every other Jew, achieve the solidarity of the Wailing Wall. The speeches which give air to these opinions are intensely interesting, passionately convincing and perfectly phrased. Although each view is by its fevered nature a partial one, such is Mr. Roth's skill that the accumulation of these partials makes for an impressive whole. UNARGUED lives may also be worth living, but you won't find them in this book. The two brothers continue to counter each other, appear to oppose each other, as the geography of the novel does, locating some of its scenes in America, others in England's green and pleasant land as well as in the deserts of Judea. Nathan's new love lives in London, and this permits Mr. Roth to parallel the book's vivid earlier scenes at the Wailing Wall with Christmas caroling in a cathedral. He lays the complacent, stupid, almost serene anti-Semitism Nathan confronts in Gloucestershire alongside the louder, less secure dislike for the goyim he finds in Israel. And finds in his brother. And finds in himself, for he is, of course, his brother - at least by now. He has accepted his brother -American middle-class dentist one moment, Israeli militant another - in order to continue to live. Live what? A fictive life?\nEach often painful encounter with these examples of Jewish love and Jewish hate has cleansed Nathan Zuckerman, who has sought the solution to his nature through book after book, of one more trapping of his type, until he finally sees himself as ''a Jew without Jews, without Judaism, without Zionism, without Jewishness, without a temple or an army or even a pistol, a Jew clearly without a home, just the object itself, like a glass or an apple.'' Except for the phallic scar, the venereal voodoo he desires to have performed upon his son - a futile mark of difference, it would seem to me, since circumcision is now more fashionable among the gentiles than pierced ears. A LITTLE past its middle, in a brilliant postmodern maneuver, the book becomes posthumous, and begins reading itself both front and rear, before and after, like a swing. With Nathan dead of Henry's heart, Henry seizes and censors the manuscript of his brother's latest book. It is a draft of ''The Counterlife.'' Our surprise at these developments, and a number of others, is honestly accounted for by the structure of the book and brilliantly brought off each time. I think the novel's daring shape will continue to possess its fascination for us upon a second look, a third reread, just the way the turns in Haydn's ''Surprise'' symphony still delight us.\nWhen a woman becomes a character, not a lover or a wife; when this character expresses her desire to leave the work the way she might a husband; when goy and galuth quarrel over, of all things, circumcision; when we remember, as good readers ought, what St. Paul said it took to make a Christian: a faith in Jesus as the Saviour that (not to hold back the knife) was the equivalent in spirit to the circumcision of the heart; and when a man (a character) who is already dead when we read the words that render his forthcoming life is heatedly arguing with his wife about one more operation, insisting that the paper tale we've been passing through in their company is ''as close to life as you, and I, and our child can ever hope to come''; and when we know, or think we know, that Zuckerman, now only ashes, wrote his own maybe-marriage with its male offspring and the boy's disputed penis into being the way he wrote his own funeral eulogy; when we realize that Zuckerman himself is Tarnopol's creation, and that Tarnopol lives only in another book by Mr. Roth, and that Mr. Roth, too, in the guise of Portnoy, Zuckerman and others, is in this same work as well, thrashing around; then we may be willing to agree that all of them have changed their nature right in front of us, passing, as it were, behind the page like a cloud; but such is the rightness of the form, the richness of the theme and the eloquence in the execution of this splendid novel that we can assent to the conventions, to the fiction, to the disclaimers and the harmless piles of paper it after all comes to, and still feel the words, still be moved and still care.\nDon't Try to Get to the Bottom of Things The following excerpt is from a recent interview with Philip Roth by Asher Z. Milbauer and Donald G. Watson, which appears in ''Reading Philip Roth,'' a collection of essays they have edited to be published later this year by St. Martin's Press.\nWe realize that you are reluctant to appear to be explicating a book prior to its publication. However, without ''explaining'' it away, can you comment generally on the unusual form for ''The Counterlife,'' which is certainly unlike anything you've done before?\nNormally there is a contract between the author and the reader that only gets torn up at the end of the book. In this book the contract gets torn up at the end of each chapter: a character who is dead and buried is suddenly alive, a character who is assumed to be alive is in fact dead, and so on. This is not the ordinary Aristotelian narrative that readers are accustomed to reading or that I am accustomed to writing. It isn't that it lacks a beginning, middle and ending; there are too many beginnings, middles and endings. It is a book where you never get to the bottom of things - rather than concluding with all the questions answered, at the end everything is suddenly open to question. Because one's original reading is always being challenged and the book progressively undermines its own fictional assumptions, the reader is constantly cannibalizing his own reactions.\nIn many ways it's everything that people don't want in a novel. Primarily what they want is a story in which they can be made to believe; otherwise they don't want to be bothered. They agree, in accordance with the standard author-reader contract, to believe in the story they are being told - and then, in ''The Counterlife,'' they are being told a contradictory story. ''I'm interested in what's going on,'' says the reader, ''only now, suddenly, there are two things going on, three things going on. Which is real and which is false? Which are you asking me to believe in? Why do you bother me like this!''\nWhich is real and which is false? All are equally real or equally false. Which are you asking me to believe in? All/none. Why do you bother me like this? In part because there really is nothing unusual about somebody changing his story. People constantly change their story - one runs into that every day. ''But last time you told me . . .'' ''Well, that was last time -this is this time. What happened was . . .'' There is nothing ''modernist,'' ''postmodernist,'' or the least bit avant-garde about the technique. We are all writing fictitious versions of our lives all the time, contradictory but mutually entangling stories that, however subtly or grossly falsified, constitute our hold on reality and are the closest thing we have to the truth.\nWhy do I bother you like this? Because life doesn't necessarily have a course, a simple sequence, a predictable pattern. The bothersome form is intended to dramatize that very obvious fact. The narratives are all awry but they have a unity; it is expressed in the title - the idea of a counterlife, counterlives, counterliving. Life, like the novelist, has a powerful transforming urge.

Illustrated. 299 pp. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. Cloth, $29.95. Paper, $17.95. SLOW BURN A Photodocument of Centralia, Pennsylvania. Text and photographs by Renee Jacobs. 152 pp. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. Paper, $24.95.\n''YOU are surrounded by all the tremendous forces of nature, straining against your effort to extract this coal. So you are in a continual struggle. Nature is out to protect its resources and you are there, wrestling the bowels out of the thing. So you are in constant danger in a coal mine.''\nMany urban Americans may view the coal fields of Appalachia as lethal and remote. The risks of mining coal underground are well enough known. But what went unsaid in the eloquent testimony above, given by a miner to a Congressional committee a generation ago - and what these angry books demonstrate anew that Government still finds ways to overlook - is that the perils of the subterranean battle for coal between man and nature extend upward to the surface.\nThe United States Bureau of Mines reported in 1979 (and has said little on the subject since) that more than 2 million people in 19 states - 80 percent of them in Pennsylvania - were suffering damage to health and property from some 250 uncontrolled fires in abandoned underground coal mines and surface culm (coal waste) banks, a number of which have been burning for years. ''Particularly during the first half of this century,'' the bureau said then, coal mining was ''accomplished without today's technological, social and environmental insight.'' But as ''Unseen Danger'' and ''Slow Burn'' show, the bureau's self-satisfied inference that things were getting better in the second half of the century was premature public relations.\nIn these books, David DeKok, a reporter with The News-Item in Shamokin, Pa., and Renee Jacobs, a freelance photographer, provide postmortems on the slow death of the little Pennsylvania town of Centralia, 125 miles northwest of Philadelphia. This village of 1,000 souls in the depressed, largely mined-out hard-coal region known to miners as ''the anthracite'' was smoked and choked for 24 years by a runaway inferno in the abandoned mine tunnels beneath it. The fire's origin is still officially a mystery, although Mr. Dekok points out that it may have been ignited when the town set fire to a landfill. By now, all but about 40 of Centralia's 500-odd houses have been razed. More than 900 people have been relocated at Government expense in a program that cost far more than the efforts, now aborted, to fight the fire in the 1970's. Relocation money was wrung from Washington only through the prolonged agony of grassroots political activism. And other Pennsylvania towns may be next. Throughout the region, Mr. DeKok writes in ''Unseen Danger,'' ''the potential for new mine fires is as great as ever.''\nIn the 1960's, when Centralia's houses began filling with lethal fumes, the Interior Department supplied monitors that detected them. The underground mine fire spread. Some residents were knocked unconscious by the noxious gases that rose to the surface. Windows had to be kept open during the winter, and snow melted on the steaming ground. In kitchens and bathrooms, water ran hot from the cold faucets. Roads were made impassable by smog. A filling station's gasoline tanks were pumped dry to keep them from exploding. And in 1981 the ground gave way beneath a 12-year-old boy, who was swallowed into the mine pit. As he dangled from a handhold on a tree root, his red cap was spotted through the fumes and steam. He was yanked back from hell. Centralia was not.\nUsing unpublished documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Mr. DeKok accuses officials of passing the buck and of cynical indifference to the people of Centralia. Former Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt is quoted as saying in 1981, the 19th year of the Centralia mine fire, ''There is not a threat to health and safety. [ The fire ] goes down deep; the deeper it burns, the less risk there is to safety. Eventually it will burn out.'' But there are enough bureaucratic villains here to fill a Dickens novel. Mr. DeKok describes Richard L. Thornburgh, the former Republican Governor of Pennsylvania, as being evasive about the Centralia fire. The Governor's predecessors, William Scranton and Milton Shapp, share the blame, the author says, along with a large cast of lesser state and Federal officials - particularly Mr. Scranton's Secretary of Mines and Mineral Industries, a professor of mining engineering named H. Beecher Charmbury. IN ''Slow Burn,'' the gallery of stark Works Progress Administration-style photographs by Renee Jacobs portrays with poignancy a Welsh, Irish and Slavic Roman Catholic community as it once was, poised in stubborn bewilderment. Describing the hundreds of deep bore holes, drilled during the years of futile efforts to track the course of the fire, Margaret O. Kirk, a freelance writer, in a brief introduction to the book, writes that the test holes - dug in schoolyards and churchyards, in sidewalks and intersections, and topped at ground level with man-high smokestacks for the steam exhaust - seemed stuck in the ground ''like freshly lit cigarettes.''\nWhat ''Unseen Danger'' and ''Slow Burn'' have to tell us is that smoking coal mines are dangerous to your health.

By Paul Auster. 179 pp. Los Angeles: Sun & Moon Press. $13.95.\nTHE LOCKED ROOM ''The New York Trilogy,'' Volume 3. By Paul Auster. 179 pp. Los Angeles: Sun & Moon Press. $13.95.\nTHE quirky richness of Paul Auster's ''Locked Room'' took me by surprise. This is the final volume in his ''New York Trilogy,'' and the first two, ''City of Glass'' and ''Ghosts,'' left a sour, medicinal taste, as if I had swallowed something terribly good for me but not very toothsome. Widely lauded as postmodern and postexistentialist and post a few other things, these two slender novels turn the detective genre into something tonier: the gumshoes in their chilly pages keep meeting doppelgangers and spitting out references to ''Don Quixote'' and Hawthorne and Thoreau. And the more they stalk their eccentric quarry, the more they seem actually to be stalking the Big Questions - the implications of authorship, the enigmas of epistemology, the veils and masks of language.\nFor mystery fans whose pleasure in the genre consists in putting together puzzle pieces, Mr. Auster's glassy little jigsaws can be seductive. His plots - decorated with death threats and ''dark-eyed'' women and all the other private-eye flotsam - draw one in like those of any other page-turner. But once the door bangs shut, the clue-sniffing reader finds himself on a swift elevator to a loftier plane. Soon he is deposited, still sniffing, on the heady heights of meta-fiction, where ''Who done it?'' has been transformed into ''Who's asking?'' and ''What does who done it mean, anyway?'' Mr. Auster has hit upon something. By changing the nature of the clues from the physical to the metaphysical, he harnesses the inquiring spirit any reader brings to a mystery, redirecting it from the grubby search for a wrongdoer to the more rarefied search for self.\nAll of which is, well, awfully good for you. But my pleasure in the detective genre - and, I suspect, for many other readers as well - is not so much in putting the pieces together as in living a while with the shamus who's doing it - trying to outguess him, yes, but also boozing with him and being dazzled by his intellectual derring-do and watching him tumble for the wrong dame. The trouble with ''City of Glass'' and ''Ghosts'' is the absence of a flatfoot worth hoofing around decrepit New York with; in addition, one longs for characters more robust and more resourceful, less wan, less cipherlike. Mr. Auster is boyishly smitten with solitude. A poet, critic and translator - whose best-known previous book is, in fact, ''The Invention of Solitude'' - he has filled the trilogy's first two volumes with the depictions of lost-soul wanderings and stir-crazy journal-keeping and the disintegration of identity - stuff that makes us think our putative detective may presently strip off his disguise to reveal a neurasthenic grad student cooped up with his final thesis too long.\nBut ''The Locked Room,'' which works best if you have read the other two books first, is a brilliant leap forward, a beguiling entertainment that accomplishes nearly everything the first two books set out to do and provides a diverting main character as well. It is the only first-person narrative in the series, and this helps enormously. Mr. Auster's philosophical asides now sound heartfelt instead of stentorian and his descents into semiological Angst feel genuinely anguished and near. The nameless narrator, whom we are meant to identify with Mr. Auster himself, is not a detective but a biographer; which is much the same thing: a chaser of facts, details, clues. The man he is researching is his recently vanished friend, Fanshawe, a golden boy who calls to mind the golden Fanshawe of Hawthorne's first novel. Hawthorne plainly viewed his solitary hero as some noble and untarnished aspect of himself, and so does our narrator, who is frequently mistaken for his old pal. But this Fanshawe's early life has been borrowed wholesale from Mr. Auster's own, so the narrator and the object of his pursuit both represent the author. In short, we are watching the writer hunt down his own identity.\nMissing and presumed dead, Fanshawe has left our narrator with some secret writings - writings which, when published, create a literary sensation (one wishes Mr. Auster had dared to recreate some substantial portion of them in this book). The narrator even marries Fanshawe's enchanting wife, Sophie (Hawthorne's wife, of course, was named Sophia), moving into his friend's life the way Jack Nicholson moved into the life of a dead acquaintance in Michelangelo Antonioni's movie ''The Passenger.'' With one difference: Fanshawe is alive, and only the narrator knows it. And that knowledge proves a dangerous thing. FOR Mr. Auster, writing too can be a dangerous thing. To compose a fiction is very much to be a private eye, gazing inward, investigating characters who may or may not be oneself. The closer one comes to one's hidden identity, the more harrowing the chase, and the novel's most vivid passages conjure up a true dark night of the soul. ''Something monstrous was happening, and I had no control over it anymore. The sky was growing dark inside - that much was certain; the ground was trembling. . . . I could no longer make the right distinctions. This can never be that. Apples are not oranges, peaches are not plums. . . . But everything was beginning to have the same taste to me.''\nIn that eloquent passage, and others like it, Mr. Auster puts his finger on the pulsing locus of language and identity. He understands that the detective of the self is trapped, forced to use that clumsiest of tools, language, to ferret out what mere language can never discover. Putting a name on something makes it at once available and all the more elusive, at once fixes it in front of us and obscures it forever. In ''The Locked Room,'' Mr. Auster proclaims the urgency of that dilemma, not just for writers but for all those who seek the truth behind the fictions they read and the fictions they live.

Illustrated. 252 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $20.95.\nSAMBO The Rise & Demise of an American Jester. By Joseph Boskin. Illustrated. 252 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $20.95.\nUNTIL the civil rights movement helped to virtually obliterate Sambo, he was white America's favorite popular image of blacks - a stupid, winning figure, drawling, wide-grinning, eager to serve, ever ready with a song and a step, nothing if not droll. Throughout American history many whites (and even some blacks), including scientists and social scientists, have made the mistake of taking this figment of the white imagination, this Sambo, as the real, true-to-life Negro.\nIn this intriguing, witty and often insightful social history of an image, Joseph Boskin traces Sambo to 16th-century Europe and Africa. To ''explain'' cultures different from their own, and to assuage their guilt, early European slavers created the view of Africans as ''natural slaves.'' Mr. Boskin, a professor of history and Afro-American studies at Boston University, observes that early on ''Sambo'' was used by whites as a racial label, perhaps because of its currency among Africans themselves: for the Hausa of western Africa it was a name of dignity, meaning ''name of a spirit'' and ''second son in the family''; but in the language of the Mende, also of western Africa, it was a verb meaning ''to disgrace'' or ''to be shameful.'' English slave traders probably also adopted ''Sambo'' as a form of the Hispanic slavers' insulting term ''zambo,'' meaning ''of mixed blood,'' ''bow-legged'' or ''monkey.'' Perhaps, too, since the name ''Sam'' was associated with English popular culture, ''Sambo'' rolled off British tongues with ease.\nFrom the earliest days of the slave trade, whites were intrigued by blacks as performers. Slavers' journals tell of ''dancing the slaves'' on board ships bound for the New World. This practice purportedly enhanced black spirits and health, but doubtless it also served to relieve white boredom and to ritualize black difference and powerlessness. Like these exhibitions, and like the roles foisted upon slaves in their daily relations with whites, plantation shows and contests of all sorts seemed to confirm Sambo's flesh and bone reality.\nIn the South, Mr. Boskin writes, ''the entertaining slave was enshrined as the performer throughout the region, whether he played at the master's house or in churches, at fairs, horse races, balls, or wherever the dominant class dressed up.'' In the North, meantime, ''the counterpart of the entertaining slave eventually trooped to the theatrical stage as the minstrel man'' -curiously, the minstrel show featured, not black performers, but white men in blackface. At its height, in the decades just before and after the Civil War, ''at least thirty full-time companies performed the show. . . . Such was the international drawing power of minstrelsy that its troupers reversed the direction of the Atlantic theatrical trade and made their imprint on English and French stages.'' ''Uncle Tom shows'' (loosely combining minstrel patter with the plot of Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel) provided a popular variant of the typical minstrel fare; the veneer of religious piety played best in country towns, where the usual blackface high jinks otherwise could seem too raucously of-this-world.\nMr. Boskin argues that Sambo was a kind of American jester, performing not for kings as such but for powerful whites, North and South, and occasionally expressing views which, without a wink and a hearty laugh, would have been strictly taboo. Mr. Boskin also shows that by the early 20th century Sambo was the American icon. He catalogues Sambo's appearances throughout American culture. The black figure beamed from innumerable postcards and advertisements, one of them declaring his company's product, ''The ham what am!'' Lawn furniture, tie clips and the tops of men's walking sticks showed Sambo smiling his toothiest smiles. Sambo mascots paraded the sidelines during football games; his head lighted up ''restaurants, stores, hotels, businesses, universities, and even churches.''\nSambo lived on as a radio voice in ''Amos 'n Andy'' (whose creators, writers and first performers were white) and many other shows, and eventually would become a mainstay of movies and television. Mr. Boskin observes that as the 20th century wore on, Sambo was undercut by black figures like Rochester (played by Eddie Anderson) on ''The Jack Benny Program.'' His unpredictability and back talk became principal features of the show's humor. This presaged the roles of the black comedians Godfrey Cambridge and Dick Gregory, who not only refused to play the Sambo role but were outspoken participants in the civil rights movement. Humor like theirs buoyed the spirits of rank and file activists of the 1960's, and turned the tables on those who had used Sambo against blacks. During this period, at an emotion-charged meeting following a major clash in Selma, Ala., James Forman, then executive secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, told a clapping audience of black organizers, ''Yeah, there was [ Sheriff ] Jim Clark rubbin' his head and his big fat belly; he was shuffling today like we used to.''\nInterestingly, Sambo even shuffled his way into key works of American history. Mr. Boskin takes to task the historian Ulrich B. Phillips, the South's first modern apologist for slavery, whose major works presumed that for blacks (Sambos) slavery was a civilizing process. And he stings Samuel Eliot Morison and Henry Steele Commager for the 1930 edition of their widely influential ''Growth of the American Republic,'' in which racist terms are used to describe several American groups, and where one reads of blacks in slavery: ''As for Sambo, whose wrongs moved the abolitionists to tears, there is some reason to believe that he suffered less than any other class in the South from its peculiar institution.' '' Even Constance Rourke falls back on the century-old convention in ''American Humor'' (1931), where she calls burlesque ''natural to the Negro.''\nYet Mr. Boskin offers no critique at all of Stanley Elkins, whose wrongheaded argument (in ''Slavery,'' 1959) that the slave plantations reduced most slaves to mindless ''Sambos'' (his term) was the central work provoking the contemporary revolution in the historiography of slavery. In counterpoint to Mr. Elkins, modern historians like John Blassingame, Eugene J. Genovese, Herbert Gutman, Kenneth Stampp, Lawrence Levine and many others have argued that although American slavery was crushing, somehow the slaves endured it with a significant degree of dignity. Rather than following the Elkins lead -invoking a concentration-camp tyranny over the slaves - these historians have explored the slaves' capacity to improvise, to keep something secret (a pencil, a middle name, a memory), to maintain some sense of family and community; in short, to create a world for themselves and to wait for a better day. Here the question of perspective is crucial: were the slaves history's pathetic victims, as Mr. Elkins would have it, or were they, to a significant degree, in control of their own minds, souls, and bodies, despite their caste status? Were they in any vital sense history's heroes? Mr. Elkins's critics say yes.\nMr. Boskin's own thesis here situates him squarely in the outworn Elkins camp. Like Mr. Elkins, Mr. Boskin condemns but nonetheless accepts the power of slavery virtually to obliterate black culture and personality. With stereotypes and antiblack humor, Mr. Boskin argues, whites did blacks in. To Mr. Boskin, Sambo was an ''extraordinary type of social control,'' leveled with special force against black men. ''To make the black male into an object of laughter, and, conversely, to force him to devise laughter, was to strip him of masculinity, dignity, and self-possession. . . . The ultimate objective was to effect mastery: to render the black male powerless as a potential warrior, as a sexual competitor, as an economic adversary.'' A chapter called, significantly enough, ''As His Name Is, So Is He,'' discusses whites' changing blacks' names to such cruelly comic ones as ''Bituminous,'' ''Snowrilla,'' and, of course, ''Sambo.'' It clearly suggests that despite some effort to resist, finally the helpless slave victim took ''Sambo'' (or a variant) as his own real name and in his heart accepted the debased role that went with it.\nMr. Boskin does not tell us that as inheritors of a tradition of mask-wearing who entered a New World full of tricks and costumes, the Africans quickly learned the survival strategy of wearing whatever mask their enslavers wished to see. The slave narratives are full of instances of blacks bowing low to whites, Sambo style, while steadily pursuing their own secret goals. Even Frederick Douglass managed to convince his owner - his last master before he took off for freedom - that he was just a happy Sambo, too contented with his place as a slave to consider another way of life. MR. BOSKIN falters, too, as an interpreter of literary texts featuring black characters.\nHe misreads Melville's ''Benito Cereno,'' making even the black slave rebel Babo into some sort of Sambo (Captain Delano sees him that way, not Melville). Mr. Boskin seems unaware of the superb body of criticism, much of it deriving from the poet and critic Sterling A. Brown, on the complex subject of black characters as seen by white authors. In a key article written in 1933, Mr. Brown catalogues black stereotypes as follows: ''the contented slave,'' ''the wretched freedman,'' ''the comic Negro,'' ''the brute Negro,'' ''the tragic mulatto,'' ''the local color Negro'' and ''the exotic primitive.''\nOne of this book's prime troubles is that it attempts to deal with far too much: Sambo as icon and actual man, slave and free, in material culture and in texts, historical and literary, on stage, radio, film and television, from slavery almost to the present. But it is Mr. Boskin's insistence on the old image of blacks as crushed victims to which I object most seriously. If he is right in saying that the Sambo image did great damage to American race relations, then it is also the case that blacks' humor kept them sane, and it kept them alive. Perhaps it also kept some whites alive. As Ralph Ellison has said, ''If you can laugh at me, you don't have to kill me. If I can laugh at you, I don't have to kill you.''
935	TOTAL IMMERSION: HENRY JAMES AND MINERAL WATERS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDF173CF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: INSPIRED by the current Henry James revival, I decided to reread ''The Ambassadors,'' the masterpiece of his later period. I'm ready at last for the late James, I thought. To go back to him is also to reread oneself.\nINSPIRED by the current Henry James revival, I decided to reread ''The Ambassadors,'' the masterpiece of his later period. I'm ready at last for the late James, I thought. To go back to him is also to reread oneself.\nThere's no difficulty with the early novels, ''The American'' or ''Portrait of a Lady.'' But when it comes to the later books, people boast of being unable to read them, as if their refusal showed how real, how vital, they were. Yet to me taking on James is a heroic act, like scaling a cliff.\nAfter everything else, there's James, like an ultimatum, forbidding us to fall short, to disappoint great expectations. The first time I saw Monet's ''Water Lilies'' in the Jeu de Paume, a wistful question formed in my mind: why shouldn't painting be satisfied with this? And James's novels evoke a similar feeling -couldn't we stop art right there? He seized on human personality at the pinnacle of its refinement - middle-class men and women behaving like gods. He raised ordinary social convention to the level of a beautiful anxiety. In James's world, responsibility is glory.\n''The Ambassadors'' is the purest James. Strether, a cultivated middle-aged American, goes to Paris to rescue and bring back to New England a young man who is leading a life of alleged moral ambiguity, compounded perhaps with a suggestion of esthetic licentiousness. From the very first page I loved the book as if I hadn't read it before. One never remembers great books adequately.\nIt may be that the candor of contemporary literature creates a nostalgia for indirection, obliquity and deferral. Waiting used to be necessary to gratification. After the simple declarative sentences of so much current writing, I felt that James had restored the wide margins, the footnotes, parentheses and punctuation to our text. His attention to his characters reminded me of Marvell's lover, who tells his mistress that he will devote ''An age at least to every part'' for ''You deserve this state; / Nor would I love at lower rate.''\nIn talking to his friend Miss Gostrey, Strether carries politeness to the pitch of mysticism. His correctness is almost a delirium, and his end runs around his conscience are as dazzling as Tony Dorsett's or Joe Morris's. Strether's deliberations are like psychoanalysis freed from sex, floating like a balloon. His scruples are a religion liberated from God. For James, a decision is not so much a plan for action as a melodrama.\nIn ''A Barbarian in Asia,'' the French poet Henri Michaux observed that while Westerners habitually divide things into halves, Hindus separate them into 16, 32, 64 or 128 parts. So does James. When Strether is tempted to leave the young man as he is, his debate with himself is worthy of a medieval casuist looking for loopholes in dogma. Perhaps Freud had James in mind when he wrote his essay on ''Analysis Terminable and Interminable.''\nA beggar in the street once asked me for money and because he was somehow appealing, I gave it to him. But that wasn't what he really wanted: as he held out his hand, he murmured in an apologetic voice, ''I don't suppose you have time to listen to my story?'' Do we have time for James's stories? Of course we do, but that's not the real question. I think that our difficulty with James stems from the fact that we can't stand to see mere human creatures - who are not in dire circumstances - shown so much patience and given so much importance. It offends our democracy, turns us indignant. The contemporary novel encourages us to understand or forgive rather than to exalt, and James's respect for our species makes us uncomfortable. In a peculiar way, it's like being loved without being desired. We're not sure we can live up to it. Paris now has a water bar, the Bar a Eaux on Rue Nicolo in the 16th arrondissement. The Bar serves 130 varieties of water and no alcoholic drinks. Its motto is ''La vie en pleine harmonie,'' or life in full harmony.\nWhile the Bar a Eaux undoubtedly originated in the notion that French livers are in danger, some observers feel the threat has simply been shifted onto the shoulders of French literature, which, as everyone knows, depends for its inspiration on the cafe. The issue is already being debated in the feuilletons. Here, for example, is an editorial from Enficeler, a Parisian journal whose title, an untranslatable Gallic pun, literally means ''to tie up with string'':\n''This threatened sobriety, this water torture, goes against the very grain of French genius. It is not for nothing that France resisted running water in its homes longer than any other great civilization. The water bar is our Waterloo; French literature is as good as washed up, its dry wit squelched and sodden. Without his litre, his fine, his flagon, the Frenchman is an anonymous alcoholic.\n''This proposed flushing can only be a foreign infusion. It was the infamous American expatriate, Henry Miller, who wrote of 'the pleasant sound of water running in the urinals.' But that is not our conception of glory, that! Ah, no, our own Verlaine was closer to the mark when he said 'It weeps in my heart / As it rains on the town.'\n''French letters will not go willingly to a watery grave! You can lead a Frenchman to water, but you cannot make him drink! Blood is thicker than Perrier!''\nA rival journal, L'Epiloir (another undecodable joke: literally ''tweezer''), took a more positive view:\n''What has been lacking in French literature since the time of Racine and Lamartine is precisely the 'oceanic feeling,' a sense of limitlessness or unboundedness, of oneness with the universe. Without this, the writer is merely a fish out of water. Nothing swells the stream of consciousness like water; it thins the bile for which our literature is notorious. It is clarity, flow; water-inspired writing seeks its own level in the reader.\n''One dampens clothes before ironing them, in order to make them supple and pliant: can we do less for literature? It is not accident that modern art developed in the Bateau Lavoir, the laundry boat of Montmartre. The Bible tells us to cast our bread upon the waters. Writing of the flood in Paris in 1955, Roland Barthes observed that 'perception is flabbergasted . . . our gaze is swept into an endless dilution.' Could one ask for a better definition of the modern? Just as painting has its watercolors, so literature will have its water writing.\n''Nothing in psychology is so soothing to the unfortunate madman as hydrotherapy, the immersion in a genial element. Can anything compare with water for sheer entertainment? We need only see it to experience an irresistible desire to plunge.\n''There is a tide in the minds of men, a time to sink or swim. The literature of France has a parched tongue: like Hugo's hunchback Quasimodo, it cries out for the mercy of water. Laved in water, billowing, our belles-lettres will shine like Joan of Arc in a wet T-shirt. Like kings, French writers will be able to say 'Apres moi le deluge!'

In ''Tongues of Flame,'' the hero undergoes peer pressure of an unusual variety: to fit in, 15-year-old Richard Bowen must start speaking in tongues. All around him people are doing it; wherever he looks, it seems, someone is muttering nonsense words in a corner.\nTim Parks opens his first novel in 1968, in the wealthy, suburban English vicarage where Richard's father presides over an ordinary, peaceful parish. Enter Donald Rolandson, a young curate who brings with him the ''Sword of the Spirit,'' and with it a frenzy of religious fanaticism. Soon everyone in the parish has become obsessed - everyone, that is, except Richard.\n''Tongues of Flame'' - initially rejected by six agents and 20 publishers, and last year's winner of England's Somerset Maugham Award for writers under 35 - is a hilarious and original portrait of a young boy grappling with good and evil, two concepts that have been instilled in him by his fanatical but well-intentioned father. According to Richard's father, Satan is lurking everywhere, manifesting himself in ''Chairman Mao, the Russians, the Vietnamese, the left-wing of the Labour Party, the unions, drugs, pornography, sex outside marriage, and certain types of modern music.''\nMr. Parks has a good eye for period detail, and he gives us a convincing illustration of British provincial life at a time when the world, according to Richard, was characterized by ''an explosion of new hairstyles and new religions.'' Although larger, political turbulence is alluded to throughout, for Richard the most visible turbulence can be found in his own home, where the drama is of a religious and, as it turns out, a sexual nature.\nSexuality is embodied by Richard's older brother, Adrian, who openly sneers at the fanaticism that surrounds him and seeks fulfillment instead in smoking pot and sleeping with his girlfriend. As the Bowen family becomes more and more obsessed with big ideas about Satan, Adrian's way of life is tolerated less and less. Adrian is a complicated character; the author doesn't fall prey to making him a sensitive young rebel of the James Dean school, but instead fleshes Adrian out, making him both nihilist and hedonist, and a force to reckon with. Adrian is extremely bright, with ''a mind like a scalpel,'' according to Mr. Bowen, who goes on to tell his older son that he should treat Richard and his sister, Anna, kindly, for they ''weren't that bright in the end,'' but that everybody is ''equal under God.''\nRichard meekly absorbs his father's perception of him, and this helps set Adrian's specialness into relief. To Richard, and finally to everyone in the community, Adrian is extremely powerful. In an ordinary late-60's household, Adrian would be viewed as just another sullen teen-ager with all the accouterments of the breed: long, unkempt hair, loud music and telltale smoke emanating from the bedroom. But in the Bowen household these elements are eventually decoded as ''signs,'' proof that Satan himself lives upstairs.\nThe novel's climactic scenes take place during the church's annual Youth Fellowship house party, a religious retreat for teen-agers held at a ramshackle boarding school. The special guest lecturer this year is Joy Kandinsky, an American evangelist in a pink pantsuit. She tells an impassioned story about a young homosexual man who was eventually ''cured'' through the Lord, and then she goes on to announce that there is someone in the room who is tortured by homosexual longing, and she urges him or her to come forward and be saved. Richard, who throughout the novel has remained curious but neutral about matters both religious and sexual, is forced at this point to examine his Continued on next page entire identity, as well as the identities of those around him. He realizes that he must start to form opinions and choose sides.\nThis realization is heightened by an outright witch hunt, of which Adrian is the quarry. A posse is formed to track down Adrian, who has been openly avoiding lectures and has been having sex with his girlfriend on the grounds of the boarding school. Richard watches in horror as his brother is apprehended, and a ritual exorcism ensues. This scene is perhaps the most powerful in the novel, and we hear a new voice emerging from Richard, one that is fierce and surprising.\nWhat happens next feels extraneous, tacked on by the author for the sake of action, when the most interesting action is internal. As one brother is exorcised of ''evil,'' the other brother, in a sense, is exorcised of passivity. ''Tongues of Flame'' approaches the notion of transformation on many levels - religious, sexual, emotional and intellectual. With all his inexperience and timidity throughout much of the book, Richard is a perfect character to embody that idea.\nMost of the characters in the novel are well drawn, and interact convincingly. The author seems to have had an especially good time inventing Richard's mild and sad mother, whose job it is to sit at the rear of the church and make hand signals at her husband if he isn't speaking loudly enough during a sermon. Also believable is Richard's humorless sister, Anna, who likes to play her guitar and sing ''I Gotta Home in Gloryland That Outshines the Sun'' on the chancel steps.\nWhat emerges is a compelling family drama. Like many families, the Bowens live in close quarters yet are, in reality, worlds apart. The gradual shredding of a child's conceptions of his parents and siblings is movingly explored here. What do you do, Tim Parks seems to ask, when you've been saddled with a crazy family? There are no simple answers to this, and it is to the author's credit that he doesn't attempt to give us any. The character of Adrian has not been overglorified; in fact, Adrian is often downright nasty to his younger brother, and difficult to love. Richard Bowen finds himself surrounded by friction, and it is this friction that finally ignites ''Tongues of Flame.''\nSoul-Searching Parties\nEverybody was talking about Satan. Rolandson was talking about him almost non-stop, and I remember he said at the Youth Fellowship on Saturday how Satan was present in the words and music of certain progressive pop groups, called Black Widow and Black Sabbath, who sang about witches and black masses: so all the members of the Youth Fellowship who had bought records by these groups had to bring them into the meetings over the next weeks and have them smashed to smithereens in front of everybody, and the debris was put in the incinerator behind the vestries while we all sang ''Raised on a Dove's Wing'' together, standing on the patch of gravel there in the howling wind.\nThe church started going out more into the community too, . . . sending out nightly parties to knock at every front door in the neighbourhood and invite people to our church. . . . The groups that went out knocking on people's doors were called ''Soul-Searching Parties,'' because they were supposed to be I was always afraid we would run into Adrian on the street, with his Afghan coat and club foot and the cynical small grin.From ''Tongues of Flame.''

By Martin E. Marty. Illustrated. 386 pp. Illinois: University of Chicago Press. $24.95.\nMODERN AMERICAN RELIGION Volume One: The Irony of It All. 1893-1919. By Martin E. Marty. Illustrated. 386 pp. Illinois: University of Chicago Press. $24.95.\nWHAT narrative on the grand scale was to historical writing in the 19th century, synthesis on the grand scale has been to historical writing in the 20th. To explain a big, complicated, confusing period or topic with penetrating ideas and elegant associations has led to greatest honor and recognition among historians, widest impact on students and the reading public, and even occasional influence on political debate and policy making. Among American historians the best examples of renowned synthesizers are Frederick Jackson Turner, who first propounded his ''frontier thesis'' in 1893; Charles A. Beard, who held forth on his economic interpretation from the 1910's to the 40's; Richard Hofstadter, who presented his social and cultural analysis in the 50's and 60's, and C. Vann Woodward, who continues to argue for a complex, ironic view of the role of the South.\nCuriously, American religion during the last century has thus far resisted efforts at synthesis, despite Reinhold Niebuhr's fertile suggestions about ''irony'' in the history of a powerful nation dominated by beliefs and values derived from Protestantism. Martin E. Marty seeks to fill this gap with this book and three succeeding volumes, which are projected to cover the whole 20th century. The title of the entire work, ''Modern American Religion,'' conveys his governing interpretation: religion, which encompasses more than Christian churches and formal worship, encountered the characteristic aspects of modern life, particularly science and technology, in the United States in strikingly different ways than in the rest of the world, especially in Europe. The title of this volume, ''The Irony of It All,'' conveys his main angle of attack: this American encounter between religion and modernity is best understood from the perspective of irony, which he openly borrows from Niebuhr. The project has great promise. Unfortunately, this volume delivers much less than I hoped to find.\nBeginning at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, which witnessed both Turner's delivery of his thesis and the World's Parliament of Religions, Mr. Marty - a professor at the University of Chicago, which also opened in 1893, right next to the exposition's midway - tracks the relationship between religion and modernity to the end of World War I. He divides his cast of characters into five groups - ''modernists,'' mostly white Protestant clergymen who affected an accommodation with science; ''moderns,'' secular thinkers and social activists who expressed a deep need to replace their now defunct Protestant faiths with some comparable worldly idealism; ''antimoderns,'' Roman Catholics, Orthodox Jews, ethnically based Protestants and blacks, who rejected modernism as either irrelevant or socially threatening; ''countermoderns,'' mainly the conservative Protestants who came to be called fundamentalists, who fought modernism on theological grounds; and ''transmoderns,'' such as Christian Scientists and Seventh-day Adventists, who emphasized community and the immediacy of faith, often with interests in the therapeutic aspects of religion.\nMr. Marty's categorization makes sense of some murky, often deliberately obfuscated controversies. It also enables him to touch on virtually every aspect of religious life in his period. His book falls short, however, as both synthesis and narrative. The problem is not that Mr. Marty has tried to achieve a 20th-century end through 19th-century means. If he had tried that, he might have written a narrative that gave a sense of the heat and passion of the times and rendered judgments on what he regards as the most important events and movements. Instead, he approaches the subject with a textbook writer's purpose and a late 20th-century liberal's social agenda.\nHispanics, Asians, women, Mormons, Pentecostals and just about everybody else get some discussion in a historical application of the equal-time rule. But such social ecumenism does not compensate for failing to treat at length, for example, the fierce interdenominational and intradenominational battles during World War I between military enthusiasts and pacifists, or the political involvement of such Social Gospel clergymen as Washington Gladden, or the ordeal of Norman Thomas in his metamorphosis during the war from Presbyterian pastor to socialist leader. THE synthesis does not hold up because the book's central ideas are too weak to bear the weight that is put on them. Not only is ''modernity'' an ill-defined concept, but encounters between religion and secular thought have occurred throughout recorded history. Why did a clash between them become so acute during the latter half of the 19th century? Why did both that confrontation and other religiously based impulses spill over into so much of society during the first part of this century? Why were the manifestations of these developments, as Mr. Marty observes, so different in America and Europe? Mr. Marty's invocation of irony does not offer much insight. Despite several lengthy, lecturish disquisitions on irony, he can only offer Niebuhr's example and cite the ability to sympathize with several sides of conflicts as reasons for making it the basis of the book. Irony seems more an artificial device imposed from without than something that the particular time, place and people demand for illumination.\nIn all, this is a useful but disappointing book. Mr. Marty's subsequent volumes may prove more satisfying. ''Conflict replaces irony as the major theme in the next three decades,'' he notes in anticipation. Good. That ought to make for a juicier story. Mr. Marty also promises to include discussions of prohibition and feminism in the next volume. I hope so. Their omission from this book not only impoverishes its story but also slights two of the most important public questions that have religious dimensions during the first 20 years of this century. If he treats those topics and others of similar moment, such as fundamentalism, war and peace, and civil rights; if he exercises a newly found selectivity and willingness to take his stand; and if he thinks through what he is really interpreting - then Mr. Marty may yet produce a narrative and a synthesis worthy of his great subject.

Knopf. $20.\n''WHEN I was born, my city was called St. Petersburg. While I was in school, it was called Petrograd. By the time I left Russia, in 1924, it was called Leningrad.'' So begins ''Choura,'' the long-awaited memoirs of Alexandra Danilova, prima ballerina of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. This is the story of an orphan who grew up to become an international star. As light as a souffle and as warm and faceted as a ruby, ''Choura'' is filled with trenchant commentary on the development and the personalities of 20th-century ballet. As Mme. Danilova observes, ''The capital of the ballet world has in my lifetime moved from St. Petersburg to New York City, and I have been one of the few to witness every stage of the shift.''\nShe trained at the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg and went on to dance with Serge Diaghilev, Col. W. de Basil and innumerable and colorful small companies throughout the world. Mme. Danilova is now a teacher at the School of American Ballet, where she passes along the grand traditions of the classical ballet. She lived with and loved George Balanchine, whose progress as a choreographer she traces here. And ''Choura'' is crammed with delicious and revealing anecdotes about other important and notorious figures, including Igor Stravinsky, Leonide Massine, Coco Chanel and Zelda Fitzgerald.\nMme. Danilova touches on a wide range of subjects, from the quality of ballet costumes and curtain bows to women choreographers, the concept of an ideal ballerina and the training of ballet company managers. She has wise things to say about teaching a new generation of dancers, and her analysis of the performer's responsibility ought to be engraved over every theater dressing room.\nThere are glimpses of great loneliness here, endured with the kind of wit that can describe the legendary Vaslav Nijinsky as the Kilroy of ballet history. ''Choura'' is a classic - perfect for anyone who loves dance.

(Houghton Mifflin, $17.95.)\nAlan Watts began his career by learning about Zen Buddhism in order to write a book about it. He wound up guiding American tourists around Japan. In between lay four decades of spiritual entrepreneurship that - to take the generous view -brought him more celebrity than peace. Watts (1915-73) declared himself a Buddhist while attending the public school attached to Canterbury Cathedral; he lost a chance at Oxford by answering a scholarship examination in the style of Nietzsche. Arrogance, provocation and self-destruction remained characteristic. Having emigrated and become an Episcopal priest, he proved a popular and energetic chaplain at Northwestern University - until he persuaded the first of his three wives to join him in a menage a quatre. After 1951 he lived in or around San Francisco, writing, broadcasting and attracting first the Beats, then the flower children. What was Watts's message? From mysticism without tears - you are part of the infinite, don't sweat meditation or self-discipline - it came to include praise of hallucinogens and even tips on diet. Monica Furlong makes a good case for her subject's rueful, if fitful, self-awareness. She is less convincing on the charm often claimed for the type she calls the ''rascal-guru'' - we glimpse it only as Watts trains the mockingbirds in his California backyard to sing like English nightingales.

Walton Litz and Christopher MacGowan. 579 pp. New York: New Directions. $35.\nTHE COLLECTED POEMS OF WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS Volume One: 1909-1939. Edited by A. Walton Litz and Christopher MacGowan. 579 pp. New York: New Directions. $35.\nWALT WHITMAN prophesied that the United States was too immense, unprecedented, strange and fragmented to be held together by anything but poetry. The American poet since Whitman whose work most wholeheartedly takes up that vision of poetry as a central national art is William Carlos Williams. This beautifully edited collection gives the poems from the first half of his career in restored chronological order, including uncollected poems as well as separate volumes, with indexes of titles and first lines, the original contents pages and helpful notes by the editors.\nToday, more than 100 years since Williams's birth and nearly 25 since his death, his poetry more than ever embodies the scope and freshness that go with such surviving, if threatened, ideals as democratic culture, modern art and the New World. Williams was an experimental artist in the generation that forced new perceptions of reality on the world - and he was also a medical doctor with a long, busy career in his hometown of Rutherford, N.J. That is, he lived and worked at the center of American life, and also in the orbit of the radical avant-garde.\nLike no other American modernist, he knew the daily life, the speech and manners, of working-class, lower-middle-class and middle-class Americans. He knew the life of a town, a city and a region, and he brought some of the cool, arrogant detachment sometimes associated with his profession to that life. As a writer, he approached it and its physical setting with a kind of antagonistic relish, seeing his culture confidently from inside, yet from the unsettling angle of a great formal innovator and a severe critic. Because of this unique vision from within and without, Williams's art provides a continuing challenge. His influence has been immense, but his model has yet to be completely appreciated. In that sense, I think, he is still an innovator, an artist whose work helps point toward the future.\nFor him, originality of technique and the ambition to write a poetry of American life in language based on American idiom embodied a single, unified project. That unity of purpose is everywhere in this book. Williams wrote poems that were conscious lessons-by-example in the making of free verse, in ways that were at the same time lessons in his kind of attention: TO A POOR OLD WOMAN munching a plum on the street a paper bag of them in her hand They taste good to her They taste good to her. They taste good to her You can see it by the way she gives herself to the one half sucked out in her hand Comforted a solace of ripe plums seeming to fill the air They taste good to her\nThe homely phrase ''They taste good to her'' moves through the different emphases of its four repetitions as if Dr. Williams were using a pointer or brilliant audio-visual aid to teach us all what lines are, and why one would write in them. First we get the five-word phrase in its whole prosaic form. Then the analytic effect of cadence and line cutting across the sentence brings out the mysterious process of syntax, stressing first the predicate adjective ''good,'' then the verb ''taste'' with the pronoun ''they'' as its subject (the word ''plums'' does not appear until two stanzas later) and at the end of the stanza the isolated phrase ''good to her.'' When the repeated sentence comes back in the last line, fitted entire into a line again, it is transformed. Rhythm and repetition have brought back to life the force and elegance inside a simple phrase.\nBut the restored process of language is only part of what the poem accomplishes. There are some plums, and a woman, and they taste good to her. The repetitions have a moral force, made explicit by the phrase ''You can see it.'' The taking in of supposedly ordinary experience is Williams's great subject, and the energy lurking inside the adjective ''good'' or inside the syntax coursing through five monosyllables indicates the energy of the senses, a force so powerful that you can see it in another person. The almost hectoring repetition becomes a way of saying how simple such seeing is, and how difficult: if you pay attention, you can see the emotional shape enclosed in a phrase so it seems to fill the air. That is, you can see not merely a scene containing a character and plums, but the process of the plums tasting good to her. If you pay sufficient attention, you may even devise a way to say it as plainly as you see it, making the most ordinary materials - ''they taste good,'' a small child could say it; ''poor old woman,'' it is what anyone might call her - memorable.\nThe example set by such poems sheds a harsh, impartial light over various kinds of contemporary taste in poetry. I mean, in one direction, the limp, rhythmless poems in short prosy lines that dribble down the pages of magazines, often a poetry based on the notation of observed details, and in another direction, forced, lurching, unidiomatic work in rhyme and more or less iambic meter, often a poetry of wit. Both modes, in relation to Williams's project, underestimate the multiple demands of experience and form, idiom and attention. I think people tolerate such things because, although many like the idea of poetry, few hope to feel much excitement about a poem. The taut, syncopated movement of Williams's poem generates an excitement that reminds us what poems can do.\nHow can one define that movement? Williams's accomplishment has sometimes been confused with a kind of verbal photography, as if the point were to depict physical realities or visual impressions in words. But his famous slogan ''(No ideas but in things)'' was not ''No ideas, but things.'' And in context, the phrase is not only bracketed by parentheses but surrounded by dynamic one-word sentences: ''Compose.'' ''Invent!'' The emphasis is on motion and energy, not depiction. He characteristically builds observation and ''concrete'' diction toward the attainment of an emotional process or idea, such as ''solace'' - the apparent ''abstraction'' or directly named feeling that flowers out of all the careful attention given words for what can be seen, smelled and touched. SWIFT movement between image and idea in the poems corresponds to the restless play among kinds of language - for example, between Latinate vocabulary and formal syntax (his careful subjunctives, or the occasional first-person ''shall'') on one side, and on the other plain American words and constructions. This movement, too, is both a formal principle and a thematic (even, in a way, a political) matter. The underlying conception of the United States as a source for the material, as well as the language, of poetry was no bland celebration of national life, nor was the Williams verbal style a mere wholesale, softening adaptation of colloquial language. His language is not the sentimental, static adaptation of American idiom of, say, Sandburg's ''Chicago,'' but an ever-shifting, eclectic experiment in daring blends and savage, unexpected harmonies. Similarly, Williams presents an America that is provisional, still unmade, even terrifying in its rawness. ''The pure products of America / go crazy,'' begins one of his most famous, and darkest, poems. Movement and speed, for good or ill, characterize both this vision of reality and the poet's stylistic response. He delighted in noting and discovering manners as a living flux, and around 1916 ended a poem (''The Young Housewife'') with the lines - The noiseless wheels of my car rush with a crackling sound over dried leaves as I bow and pass smiling. - observing the little nod we make with the steering wheel in our hands, the old European court gesture in its new vernacular setting: the car; the street; a thrill-Continued on page 20 ing, ruthless efficiency of motion; and the self-consciously libidinous doctor looking at a young housewife at the curb, with similes for her in his head as he passes over the leaves in his heedlessly rushing contraption.\nBut description falls short of Williams's poems because the language he wrote in was like his conception of the country - not only provisional, but alertly inventing itself as it went. Thus, any simple alternation would be too mechanical for the exuberant, testy energy that delighted in pitching formality and high language against, and into and around, their supposed opposites so resourcefully and with such cunning surface innocence that high and low, formal and informal, cannot be told apart: FINE WORK WITH PITCH AND COPPER Now they are resting in the fleckless light separately in unison like the sacks of sifted stone stacked regularly by twos about the flat roof ready after lunch to be opened and strewn The copper in eight foot strips has been beaten lengthwise down the center at right angles and lies ready to edge the coping One still chewing picks up a copper strip and runs his eye along it\nThis is entirely an account of the roofer's work and yet also of the work of the poet who runs his eye along the scene. The two stanzas about the beaten copper strips perform the trope of poetry delighting in its own difficulty of composition, like the lines in Yeats's ''Adam's Curse'' about how hard it is to write verse that sounds natural or Ben Jonson's lines about revision in his elegy on Shakespeare. Without mentioning poetry or himself or neglecting the roofers, Williams conveys all this by implication, partly through combining disparate kinds of word. ''Fleckless light'' is elevated and poetic, whereas ''separately in unison'' is obsessively precise, and while ''coping'' and ''eight foot strips'' are technical in another way, it is hard to say if ''strewn'' is archaic and high like ''fleckless'' - or the most technical term of all, a part of the sweet old jargon of the crafts and trades, and their techniques. THE gesture of picking up the stuff of work while still chewing, like the bow while driving the car, makes a spontaneous, graceful transition between formality and improvisation, necessity and pleasure. On their level, the gestures embody the fluid, inspired invention that was the poet's central esthetic principle, and a kind of ethical or political ideal as well. That ideal has something to do with the way works of art imply whom art belongs to, and the poetry in this volume conveys that its radically fresh art belongs somehow to us who live the actual American life Williams's poetry comes from, and calls to account. It is as if he urges us to be both at home with our materials and ''still chewing,'' impatient to transform them.\nThe early pages of this book trace the development of an indigenous American avant-garde style, a unique modernist accomplishment that embraces all of the poet's intelligence along with all of his American experience. That accomplishment should embody a standard for any living American poet who sets out to write, whether in elegant stanzas or jagged ones. From around 1914 on, Williams's work attained an implied critique of our culture that still penetrates in a special way because it comes from within, not from the more European or global perspective of Pound and Eliot. By bringing together his stringent idea of art and a transforming vision into the ordinary, Williams by 1939 had set a continuing, essential challenge for American readers and poets.

Three new books of poems are distinctive in their erudition. Mary Barnard published a volume of essays on early astronomical systems (''The Mythmakers'') 20 years before distilling her research in the poems of ''Time and the White Tigress.'' Jill Breckenridge spent eight years studying the historical record of the Civil War in order to write the narrative poem ''Civil Blood.'' And Albert Goldbarth inspected a rich, if fragmentary, assortment of ''curiosities,'' from Leonardo's map of the river networks of Tuscany to biographies of Christopher Columbus, to write the candidly titled ''Arts & Sciences.''\nThe 12 sections of Ms. Barnard's book treat common themes in astronomical systems of the north temperate zone - Babylonian and Egyptian, Greek and Roman, Chinese, Mayan and Islamic. The 60 pages of poems, with handsome linocuts by Anita Bigelow, are supplemented by almost 20 pages of notes. The notes are a useful ornament, not an intrusion. They explain that people have seen the ''sphere of the fixed stars'' divided by great circles - in which the Earth and the celestial bodies, including the visible Milky Way, all move and which have been used to explain the seasons and the changing position of sunrise on the horizon; that, for settled tribes, reliably indicates solstice and equinox. In a sky thus ordered, constellations precipitate like crystals - the Great Bear, which never sets around the fixed point of the North Pole; the zodiac, which populates the ecliptic plane, spinning backward through its houses.\nMs. Barnard also provides a great deal of information in her poems, but her explanations of how customs and calendars, mythology and mathematics, arise in relation to stargazing are not in the least prosaic. On every page her habitual iambic pentameter, slightly roughened for variety's sake, builds to passages of great lyrical purity. In the fifth section, for example, she describes how discrepancies resulting from the superposition of solar on lunar year-counts generate festival days during which, paradoxically, time ceases in order to realign itself: The thirteenth moon remained as a handful of days when time stood still, and the moon caught up with the\nsun - a dozen days at the year's end; this was the epact, an interregnum, when, through a twelve-day chink in the calendar, beings from outside time slipped in, when mummers paraded, chain-dancing from door to\ndoor, when Father Liber was king and the servant was master.\nHuman ritual behavior is the heart of our sociability, in which we affirm our loves, limit our capacity for destruction and re-create the forms of common life. Ms. Barnard reveals how thoroughly ritual has always depended on astronomical arrangements of the world:\nat last the universe is in order. We know where we are. When we build our hogans and temples, or bury our dead we know how to place them in space and in time. Her depiction of archaic astronomy as the orderly matrix of ritual is passionately compelling.\nYet she never lets us forget how arcane and impersonal a study astronomy is. Our ancestors were not studying false objects, gods and goddesses, the stars, or really any objects at all. They were discovering and inventing systemic patterns, orientations and rangings that cannot be seen but only inferred. The planet is never the goddess. The brilliant, mysterious point of light appearing and disappearing, always keeping close to the sun, is but one epiphany marking the times of her ascendancy. The principles of order brought to life in Ms. Barnard's book are at once highly abstract and of the greatest human import, and this must account for the warmth and drama of her wholly impersonal style. ''Civil Blood'' by Jill Breckenridge is a long narrative poem, with some interludes of prose, about two men, Cabell and Jacob, caught up in the Civil War. Cabell is based on John Cabell Breckinridge, an ambivalent Kentucky slaveholder, Vice President of the United States under President Buchanan and a Confederate general. Jacob, Cabell's slave and childhood companion, seems both less typical and less individuated than Cabell, though perhaps he is also based on a real person. In the first and most lyrical of the book's four sections, their two voices alternately tell stories of childhood, early manhood and marriage, and of the outbreak of the war. The second part concerns the war itself, reported mostly in Cabell's voice, with authorial asides and documentary ventriloquism. The final parts trace Cabell's escape from the defeated South and his exile, pardon and eventual return to Kentucky, where he and Jacob, who has also come home, live out their days.\nCabell's story has the force of verisimilitude, although it hovers uneasily between literary narrative and historiography. As if resurrected from patchy historical records, it includes tangential allegiances and twists of fate only loosely related to its general drift. Yet in certain cases, Ms. Breckenridge observes the dramatic unities by consciously distorting historical fact. Cabell's half-dozen military engagements are conflated into a single archetype, the description of which contains some of the author's most powerfully critical writing. Here she recounts the slaughter of horses in terms that recall the formulaic and yet horribly graphic battle scenes of the ''Iliad'': ''over the hard ground toward the stream where a hundred artillery horses tied halter to halter lower their big heads to drink, and I must shoot them, every one, kill the dapple gray, who goes down on one knee, kill the bay, who, mouth open, rears, black mane and tail flying, sprays blood from its mouth in a final red flag. . . .''\nThe figure of Jacob is less plausible than Cabell, especially when read in the context of 19th-century slave narratives. The poignant testimony of Frederick Douglass's experience with the Aulds of Baltimore is that the institution of slavery, ''the fatal poison of irresponsible power,'' corrupted even the kindliest souls, making them petty tyrants with whom true intimacy was impossible. Ms. Breckenridge portrays the psychology of domination very well when Cabell and Jacob get into mischief together as children. Cabell blames Jacob, who is beaten, and then rebuffs his pathetic attempt at reconciliation: He tries a little smile on me, but I'll have none of it, scowl hard at him over the candle's pale flicker, a look I hope he knows means he must never do such a thing again. Never again.\nYet after his wife and child are killed in an unsuccessful attempt to escape, Jacob's primary emotional bond is to Cabell, whom he follows around for the rest of his life. Resettled in postwar Kentucky, Jacob mentions that he taught reading and writing to his fellow freedmen until stopped by the Klan, but his ''master'' is his only living intimate. What Douglass tells us, by contrast, is that his fiercest love and longstanding devotion belonged to the fellow slaves with whom he risked his life to share the potent secret of literacy. Albert Goldbarth writes long poems with long lines full of descriptive detail. In ''Arts & Sciences,'' whenever he begins an argument or narrative, he is sooner or later diverted by the superabundance of language and the cornucopiousness of the world. The people in his poems (one is always himself) either produce clutter or notice dozens of modulations in the objects or situations surrounding them - or, if they don't, he notices for them. His poems always have multiple topics. Thus a poem about Leigh Hunt's collection of famous locks of hair includes John Bartram, an 18th-century New World collector for a London merchant-botanist, and it interrupts and elaborates his tale with lists of his finds: ''shooting star, white osier, bittersweet, steeplebush, / arrowroot, river birch, witch hazel, sassafras.'' The list continues for eight more lines.\nTo make works of art out of such heterogeneous material, a poet needs a strategy of unification. Mr. Goldbarth's usual strategy is to construct his poems as what Alastair Reid calls garlands. He starts off with one topic, moves on to a second and third through a some-Continued on page 24 times illuminating, sometimes arbitrary process of association, and keeps moving. By the time a reader has arrived at the last topics, he or she has forgotten all about the first, to which Mr. Goldbarth invariably returns just at the end so that the shock of recognition produces an impression - sometimes an illusion -that there is a unity in the assemblage.\nWhen successful, Mr. Goldbarth's end-linked collages generate suggestive symmetries and important questions. In ''The Elements,'' he begins by describing the composition of a Dutch still life with loving subtlety: If the dull swell of a herring on a plate picks up red chevrons meaning a candle (out of sight) is lit, the crystal of burgundy weighting another corner is given a small red heart of light at its center so everything, in shape and weight, is balanced. Then he switches to brutal and sad vignettes of Vietnam, before he returns to the painting in a series of questions about how the ''order and abidingness'' of art bear on human suffering.\nElsewhere even Mr. Goldbarth seems uncertain about where his digressive circling leads. One section of a long prose poem ends: ''There are drawings on walls from then we still can't read, long letters to God or amatory verses to somebody's rosebud lips. And this could be a battery cell from the year of Christ's birth. Miltie's. The Rialto. Nobody knows what it means.'' The next, final section of the same poem gives examples of various kinds of social behavior in animals and in people, which, his juxtaposition of them suggests, all constitute the same togetherness under the rubric of ''committees.'' Mr. Goldbarth must have read quite a bit of natural history to find these examples, but he has missed an important function of science, and discursive thought generally, which is to make discriminations when and where they are needed. Why confound the differences between flocking animals and animals that bond as individuals, between the inherent rituals that link certain animals and the learned, much more fragile and constructive, rituals that unite people? Poetry can no more dispense with discrimination than science can. If, without compromising his own sense of reality's ambiguous richness, Mr. Goldbarth could make his poems more orderly and spare, they would more often be greater than the sum of their parts.

The book editor of The Tulsa World in\nOf all this decade's mystery novels involving newspapermen, and there have been many, none is more a hymn of praise than NECESSARY by Ken Jackson (St. Martin's, $15.95). Most authors invest their newsmen with cynicism. Not Mr. Jackson. He romanticizes and even sentimentalizes them. The book editor of The Tulsa World in Oklahoma, he loves everything about newspapers, and he especially loves the newsroom, whence reporters depart with their assignments and return to write stories that once in a while can shake their locality and even the nation.\nIn this book his hero has the unlikely name of Nathan Necessary. Necessary, once a top investigative reporter, is an alcoholic who now is a copy editor for an Oklahoma paper. He gets an anonymous tip about corruption in the county government, starts to investigate in his spare time and is scared off. In a fit of self-loathing he goes off the bottle and, with an ambitious copy boy, starts following leads and amassing evidence. Along the way there are murders and a Mafia connection, but Necessary finally gets his story.\nNathan Necessary is a compilation of everything that the author thinks a great reporter should be. Unfortunately he and the other characters end up as stereotypes - the tough but understanding managing editor, the reporters motivated only by the quest for the truth, the slimy evildoers. We have seen all this on television.\nBut throughout the book there breathes a spirit that films and television have not captured. When Mr. Jackson writes about newspapers there is actually a kind of poetry. He manages to convey the camaraderie of the newsroom, the excitement in a reporter's mind while working on a story, the ego gratification when it is a big one, the monomania a true reporter brings to his job. It is a monomania that approaches a frenzy in which girlfriends or wife, family and sleep, mean nothing when a big story is breaking. If the characters themselves are too good to be true, the newspaper itself springs vividly to life. Would that there were more of its kind in the United States.\nJust as ''Necessary'' is a paean to journalism, so LOW ANGLES by Jim Stinson (Scribners, $13.95) is a study of the drives that motivate film directors and editors. The central character is Stoney Winston, who made his first appearance in 1985 in ''Double Exposure.'' Stoney, a film editor, is still living a hand-to-mouth existence, hoping for the big time, desperate to break out of the junk with which he is constantly saddled. ''Low Angles'' is a crime novel, but crime takes second place to Mr. Stinson's fascination with the cinematic mind. Stoney is hired by a shady producer to supervise a schlock, Hell's Angels kind of motorcycle film being directed by a woman. It turns out that she is unknown but really very good. Somebody is out to sabotage the film, and matters approach a complete breakdown until Stoney moves in.\nWe learn a great deal about low-budget film making and financial finagling. And we learn just as much about the artistic aspirations even of those who know they are working on trash. It may be trash, but one does the best one can. Perhaps things can be improved. Perhaps a new approach to the camera work can redeem the film. Perhaps the bored and underpaid crew can be made to feel stimulated. Mr. Stinson, a fine writer, makes these situations very real.\nDouglas Kiker, the well-known NBC News correspondent, has written two novels. Now he turns his hand to mystery fiction with MURDER ON CLAM POND (Random House, $15.95), another book about a newspaperman, and a nice piece of work it is. The action takes place on Cape Cod, where a drifter named McFarland - former marine, newly divorced, unemployed reporter who was a Pulitzer winner - lives in a miserable shack and feels sorry for himself.\nHis neighbor, an old woman, is murdered. She was very rich and had been the moving force in the town. The local police chief takes charge. He is a giant of a man with a fondness for speaking Latin: ''Te posterius videbo, alligator.'' See you later, alligator. The Boston Globe asks McFarland to do the story. He is thrilled, says yes, and then goes crazy trying to find a lead - an arresting first paragraph. Mr. Kiker amusingly and accurately describes writer's block. He also knows small-town characters and writes in a graceful, fast-moving style.\nJimmy Sangster's SNOWBALL (Holt, $15.95) introduces James Reed, a California beach bum who pretends to be a writer. British-born, a retired Scotland Yard cop, he was once married to a Hollywood superstar. His former wife calls for help. Her daughter (by a marriage previous to theirs) is in trouble and needs him. It has something to do with drugs. She is indeed in trouble, and Reed has to deal with the drug scene in a film studio, the tycoon who owns the studio, killers and an attractive woman who lends him a hand. This is a very nice job - smooth, sharp, believable, well written.
944	IS THIS CRIME INEVITABLE?	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DD173CF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: RAPE Edited by Sylvana Tomaselli and Roy Porter. Illustrated. 292 pp. New York: Basil Blackwell. $24.95.\nRAPE Edited by Sylvana Tomaselli and Roy Porter. Illustrated. 292 pp. New York: Basil Blackwell. $24.95.\nLAST year I read a news story on ''ways to deter rape'' based on a psychological study of 800 convicted rapists. The authors of the study advised women to engage the rapist in friendly conversation and to decide according to his responses whether to categorize him as exploitative, compensatory, angry, or sadistic. They suggested different strategies in each case. If the rapist, for example, ''responds to talk by increasing his aggression and seems to want to humiliate and demean his victim,'' he is angry and should be handled empathetically: ''Try to demonstrate your sense of interest, concern or caring.'' I won't even repeat their recommendations about the sadist.\nThis macabre scenario might work as feminist satire, but it is terrifying to imagine one's life depending on it. In many courts, moreover, these feminine expressions of empathy might be taken as evidence of sexual consent. Such impossible ''advice'' both reinforces women's feelings of powerlessness and places the responsibility for deterring rape on the victims. Even in the wake of legal reforms sparked by feminist analyses like Susan Brownmiller's influential ''Against Our Will,'' women carry the burden of two ''rape laws'': the legal system and the fear-generated system of internalized rules, boundaries and curfews that governs everyday life.\nCan we imagine a world without rape and the fear of it, or is rape a permanent and inevitable aspect of human society? In a step toward the comprehensive history of rape they hope might provide answers to these questions, Sylvana Tomaselli, an intellectual historian at Newnham College, Cambridge University, and Roy Porter, a historian of medicine at the Wellcome Institute in London, have invited a number of American and British scholars to discuss rape from the perspective of their own fields. The result of this laudable enterprise is an informative, if sometimes frustrating mix of ideas from law, psychoanalysis, anthropology, classics, art history, philosophy, sociobiology and popular culture.\nOne problem is that not all of these disciplines have an equal stake in the issue of rape, or an equal value in assessing it. In a discussion of the perspectives from psychoanalysis, John Forrester, who has written widely on the history and philosophy of psychoanalysis, is commendably frank about the incompatibility of psychoanalytic and legal discourse. Within the Freudian universe, he notes, ''there is no zero state of desire,'' and the analyst must bracket ''social conflict, conflict between individuals, to highlight the conflict within individuals.'' But, Mr. Forrester insists, morally neutral psychoanalytic theories that deal with memory or unconscious process, rather than actual experience, must not be brought into the courtroom or allowed to affect legal decisions.\nSimilarly, sophisticated analyses of the literary or visual representation of rape have to be distinguished from its social reality. In a brilliant essay on Greek myths about rape, the classicist Froma Zeitlin shows how their apparent endorsement of ''phallic power and female victimage'' conceals a more ambiguous narrative of male sexual anxiety. In another dazzling contribution, the art historian Norman Bryson demonstrates that the iconology of rape in neo-classical painting involves a set of conflicting interpretations of female sexuality and consent. But it is never clear how such subtle motives and motifs in art can illuminate the stories we read in the headlines. Even Christopher Frayling, a historian of popular culture, concedes in his lively discussion of Jack the Ripper as the cultural stereotype of the rapist that the Ripper was actually not a raper.\nThe most useful and constructive essay is Jennifer Temkin's discussion of rape and legal reform. A lecturer in law at the London School of Economics, Ms. Temkin argues that changes in the criminal justice system that protect the victims and lead to higher rates of conviction are the most significant steps that can be taken toward controlling rape; and she describes the ways that feminist lobbying groups in several countries have campaigned effectively for legislative reform. In England, where there has been virtually no legal reform, judicial utterances on rape put the woman on trial.\nIn 1982, for example, a judge at the Cambridge Crown Court gave the following summary to the jury: ''Women who say no do not always mean no. It is not just a question of saying no, it is a question of how she says it, how she shows and makes it clear. If she doesn't want it she only has to keep her legs shut and she would not get it without force and there would be marks of force being used.'' Ms. Temkin recommends broadening and differentiating legal definitions of rape; shifting emphasis away from the question of the woman's consent to the degree of coercion, physical injury and incapacitation of the victim; and limiting testimony about the plaintiff's sexual history.\nSeveral essays argue that rape is a cultural variable. The anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday describes the differences between rape-prone societies like our own, and virtually rape-free societies like West Sumatra. The incidence of rape, she finds, is lowest where principles of nurturance and nonaggression associated with matrilineage govern interpersonal behavior, and highest where masculine identity is directed by ''an ideology of toughness'' and a need to exert dominance. Ms. Sanday views rape as a form of ''concealing male vulnerability and maternal dependency,'' a man's defense against his own despised ''feminine'' dependencies by degrading and punishing the female body. In a brisk revisionist look at rape in the past, Roy Porter too makes excellent use of 18th- and 19th-century trial records to show that meanings of sexual violence must be understood in the specific historical contexts of ''economic, political, domestic and ideological arrangements.''\nFrom the perspective of sociobiology, however, rape is a timeless and universal human behavior rather than a culturally or historically differentiated one. In the most controversial essay, Randy Thornhill, Nancy Wilmsen Thornhill and Gerard Dizinno offer an evolutionary theory of rape as the reproductive strategy of sexual losers, or, as they pithily put it, ''an evolved facultative behavior . . . engaged in by men who are relatively unsuccessful in competition for the resources and status necessary to attract and reproduce successfully with desirable mates.''\nThey reach this conclusion by analogy with the mating behavior of the genus Panorpa, or scorpion fly. Male Panorpa entice female Panorpa with a nuptial food offering, preferably a dead arthropod, although salivary secretions will do. Those small males who can't produce these desirable gifts attempt forced copulation instead, seizing the female's wing with their dorsal clamp and attacking her with their genital claspers. Although female Panorpa flee from males without a nuptial offering (escaping about 85 percent of the time) and resist forcible copulation - and lay few eggs when they are raped - such coercive mating is ''in no way an abnormal or 'aberrant' behavior'' for male scorpion flies. THE authors point out that human males too compete for the resources that will promote access to fertile females, and they maintain that ''it is those human males who have the greatest difficulty in climbing the social ladder who are most likely to rape.'' The clincher of their argument is that rapists prefer ''young females of high reproductive capacity'' as their victims. Flatly rejecting feminist or sociological theories about rape as products of ''ideological fervor,'' the authors deal with all the instances contradicting their own sweeping claim, such as the use of extreme violence, the ''adjustment difficulty'' of the victim, or attacks on children and the elderly, by consigning them to the realm of ''accident or psychotic mentality.''\nOne can only hope that such feeble logic does not pass muster even in the sociobiological community, but it is disappointing that other contributors to the volume do not take issue with the essay, or challenge the ''non-ideological'' pretensions of this kind of scientific discourse on sexual violence. A more vigorous internal debate would have made the book more valuable; instead, the essayists stay safely within their own disciplinary boundaries. For the contemporary woman who can neither expect the United States to become a nurturing matrilineal culture, move to West Sumatra, or turn herself into a tree, what prospects can these essays suggest for a future without rape? Clearly, the quarrel over women's consent ought not to be the basis of a legal definition of rape, nor of its mythology and representation. Our best hope must be the continued effort of women and men to reform the law and thereby the culture. Meanwhile, this provocative collection will keep the conversation going. More Gatherers Than Hunters\nThe popular view that man (i.e. the male) is basically an animal who evolved by virtue of his dominance over others rationalizes the pornographic mentality. The picture of early human social life that emerges from the work of anthropologist Nancy Tanner paints a quite different picture. She argues that male tenderness and female bonding led to the evolution of Homo sapiens. It was not hunting that brought about early human society but gathering plant food. Mothers who gathered plant food in groups with other women and who learned to walk upright and carry implements were those most likely to have children who survived to contribute to the gene pool. Natural selection favoured those with the intelligence to gather and the sociability to share with offspring. The men who belonged to these groups were those who, like women, were intelligent and sociable, adept with their hands and able to cooperate. The scenario of the violent male who roamed around beating and raping women is extremely unlikely given the need for cooperation in the gathering of plant food, which probably comprised the majority of the diet. Tanner's analysis suggests that it was male tenderness along with female sociability that produced human beings. We can conclude that while male violence will almost certainly end the world, it was heterosexual cooperation that began the long path to humanity.\nFrom ''Rape'' (Peggy Reeves Sanday).

The astuteness of her logic, her nimbleness with balance sheets and trajectories regularly leave the men around her in the dust. She makes a point never to have more than one drink at lunch, and though she has a ''gleaming cap of blond hair,'' ''limpid blue eyes'' and is tall, very tall - the Athena of the tax shelter game - she never uses her femininity to advance her career. ''To her mind, that was the most disastrous and tempting mistake a woman in business could make. . . . Over time, she would find that she had moved from the category of colleague to the category of bunny or kitten. And however much they might like to pet them, people did not take bunnies and kittens seriously.''\nThe seriousness with which Jennifer takes herself more than suffices. It's necessary if she is to survive the slippery gray menace of the old-boy network, and to triumph, which she does about every 10 pages.\nJennifer is also gifted with an exquisite nose for any whiff of financial, or moral, irregularity. Invited to join the board of the Metropolitan Ballet, she senses at her first meeting that there is something not up to snuff in the debate - or lack of debate - over the choice of a new director. She also cleverly intuits that her secret adversary is millionaire smoothie Douglas Diamond, ''the most important figure in Manhattan commercial real estate'' and owner of Diamond Place, which ''offered the most exclusive shops and the most expensive condominium apartments in the city, and possibly the world.'' The rub is that Jennifer most likely buys her Jean Muir ensembles there, even though she and her highly evolved social conscience abhor the fact that ''her business required her to display the accepted signs of wealth and success.''\nThis conviction, however, does not keep Jennifer from a scary omniscience when it comes to New York's hip artists, wines, cheeses and mineral waters. Unfortunately, you sense that in Mr. McMahan's mind, there is little difference between this list and his catalogue of her feminist virtues. They are just one more strain of his compulsive name-dropping, in the same category as the braised radicchio salad Jennifer ate for lunch, and with the same weight in her life.\nOnce inside her apartment, Jennifer regresses to vulnerable, lovesick woman. The case for her emotional schizophrenia is about as convincing as the case for her feminism, and just as fatuous. Mr. McMahan simply trots out a battery of trendy theories about the beleaguered soul of the Manhattan career woman: if she is successful in business, her private life is a mess; she has turned libber because she was rejected in love; she needs a good man to set her straight. Mr. McMahan even puts her through a punishing 80's version of ''The Perils of Pauline,'' featuring a lover who leaves her for another man - his parting gift, a possible case of AIDS. In this instance, Mr. McMahan's obsession to be au courant slips into cruel manipulation. IN the end, Jennifer is a bunny (or kitten) in feminist clothing. Outwitting the surveys that would have her a 35-year-old spinster, she finds the man that every adolescent girl longs for, a mysterious, gauntly handsome count-in-exile, older and taller than she, and given to black leather trenchcoats. He is also a renowned ballet dancer who, after Jennifer's long, silent vigil of hope, turns out to be a closet heterosexual. Miracles can be wrought, it seems, even in New York, if you are a very, very good and clever girl, always tell the truth, and commit to memory the best 10 spots in the city to find a decent Beaujolais nouveau.

Edgar Hoover,'' ''Babe Ruth,'' ''Charles Lindbergh.'' On my index card I'd just written ''Fritz Mandelbaum.''\nON the fourth day after my arrival in this country some 40 years ago, I stood, a New York high school freshman, before a bank of lockers labeled ''J. Edgar Hoover,'' ''Babe Ruth,'' ''Charles Lindbergh.'' On my index card I'd just written ''Fritz Mandelbaum.''\n''Uh - listen, Fritz,'' said Mr. Saperstein, who was to be so helpful in other aspects of my American novitiate. ''Maybe you want to do like the other guys. Don't use your own name, but somebody famous, for fun.''\nEars burning at my ignorance of these Yankee celebrities, I wrote ''Old Shatterhand'' on the other side of the card.\n''Where'd you get that name from?'' Mr. Saperstein asked. ''But - it is from Karl May!'' I said. ''Who?''\nI still remember how amazed I was and how rather comforting the amazement. My dummkopf incomprehension of Babe Ruth had been neutralized by Mr. Saperstein's - a teacher's! - ignorance of Karl May. To me the luster of that name was axiomatic. After all, the legendary in Karl May's books saturated (and still saturates) just about every Central European boyhood.\nMay is a paragon of what the Germans call Trivialliteratur, or genre fiction. The fantasies of a yarn-spinner who was less than profound but more than facile have been mesmerizing German-speaking readers for just about a century now. It was 100 years ago, in the mid-1880's, that the first of a series of books appeared to whose robust appeal not even the most rarefied intellects were immune. ''My whole adolescence stood under his sign,'' said Albert Einstein. ''Much in his work was imperishable,'' said Albert Schweitzer. ''He represents,'' said Hermann Hesse, ''the most brilliant example of an elemental form of literature, namely the literature of wish-fulfillment.'' By fulfilling a wish no one else had gratified so thrillingly before him, Karl May refashioned the self-image of a nation.\nWherever German is read his 73 novels have remained continuously in print, so unflagging is the demand for an author who died 75 years ago. Seven of his books have been translated in the United States in the last decade; and last summer saw the American premiere of the director Hans-Jurgen Syberberg's film ''Karl May'' (1974), part of a trilogy that includes ''Ludwig, Requiem for a Virgin King'' and ''Our Hitler.''\nTo explain the writer's impact, I should start with his life. Perhaps only Karl May, that virtuoso of flamboyant improbability, could have invented such a career. Imagine a boy born in 1842, the fifth child of 14 in a poor weaver's family. Imagine him going blind with malnourishment and staying blind until he was 5. Imagine frail little Karl squinting himself into literacy in grade school and, thanks to his intelligence, into a teacher's training school in his teens. Imagine him, on the brink of respectability as a substitute teacher, arrested for theft - the first of a series of sleazy offenses that saw him in and out of prison for the next decade and a half. And then imagine the paradoxes of his mind-boggling ascent.\nMay, whose background was so wretchedly unheroic, begins to write about a knight-errant of nonpareil ethics and muscle. Known as Old Shatterhand in Indian territory, he battles desperadoes. As Kara ben Nemsi, he takes on fiendish emirs in the dunes and casbahs of Arabia. May's experience at that point was entirely and provincially Middle European. He had never been west of the Rhine or south of the Alps. Yet he wrapped his hero's bravery in persuasively textured exotica - the weighty spoor of the grizzly bear, the idiosyncrasies of the camel, the rhythm of the muezzin's call, the tempering of a tomahawk blade.\nMay had every reason to separate his actual life from his stories. Yet he did exactly the opposite. Billing his novels ''Reiseerzahlungen'' or ''travel tales,'' he implied they were autobiography rather than fiction. His protagonist likes the dialect of May's native Saxony. And the name ''Kara ben Nemsi'' points directly at the author - it means Karl, son of the Germans.\nAs a result, May's fame rose in direct proportion to his characters'. That rise was stupendous. At first his work was serialized in monthlies aimed at juveniles and he instantly eclipsed long-established contributors. The moment his ''Reiseerzahlungen'' were published as books, buyers of all ages con-verged on the stores for the newest May. He outsold, and still outsells, the competition by a staggering margin in German-speaking lands. Other adventure novelists - no matter how great their resonance elsewhere - have never been able to match his mystique. When Rudyard Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson and Jack London were translated into German in the 1890's, their publishers packaged them in a format imitating May's.\nThe last decade of his life (he died in 1912) knew controversy and defamation, that final dimension of renown. Headlines screeched his early life as a criminal; he became mired in libel litigation that embittered him while it increased his sales. After his death his popularity swelled still further. Each new crop of German youth read more Karl May than the preceding. A publishing house - the Karl May Verlag - was founded just to print his novels, the Karl May Yearbooks and the proceedings of the Karl May Society as well as endless biographies, appreciations and interpretations of the man.\nThe cult flourished through the two world wars, indeed spread. The actor Lex Barker left a middling Hollywood career to become something of a superstar in Central Europe as Kara ben Nemsi and Old Shatterhand. And recently East Germany caved in to the inevitable: for 30 years it had banned the ''chauvinist'' Karl May, but now Germans East as well as Germans West can wolf down their doses of Shatterhand and Nemsi; each Germany has its own Karl May Museum.\nTo sell the 100 million copies May has so far, a writer must command more than one virtue - and probably more than one fault. May's flaws are abundant. Nuance does not interest him. His leading players are either seamlessly noble or irremediably vile; his supporting actors are well-carpentered stereotypes - the eccentric English lord or the big-mouthed sidekick. His style, though never clumsy, is artless, straightforward, the plain handmaiden to his plots.\nBut, ah, his plots! What an ingenious, intricate web of main and sub! Within the reassuring framework of the Happy End, what a mosaic of entrapment and getaway, cunning and countermove, evil enigma and inspired solution! How unerringly paced the narrative! The angle of suspense is ever shifting. A minute away from death by poisoned arrow, Old Shatterhand manages to cut the cords that bind him. But who slipped him the knife? A new mystery begins, another tantalizing turn. And May's encyclopedic way with local color not only fleshes out the action but ministers to the German hunger for fact; with each denouement one learns how the Bedouin roasts his lamb or how the Comanche grooms his horse.\nStill, the magic of Karl May transcends expertly orchestrated derring-do. It issues as well from the nature of his protagonist. Old Shatterhand is not Wyatt Earp. Earp, like many of his counterparts in American westerns, is a lawman with a touch of the outlaw. He comes to town to clean out the rotters, but is himself on the lam from another town - if not from its sheriff, from its unjust suspicions. He is an outsider: disillusionment feeds his alertness, powers his trigger finger, solicits our sympathy.\nOld Shatterhand's outsiderdom, by contrast, seems purely superficial. He is a greenhorn and overcomes that stigma with his fists and his marksmanship. He knows no interior corrosion; villainy constantly confronts him, but his motives for traveling are those of a keen-minded, equable naturalist, interested in flora and fauna. Exploits finished, he'll return to his Saxon coziness. BUT - and it's a fascinating but - the prowess of the Karl May hero proved magnetic only in combat with non-German foreigners outside Germany. May novels with a Middle European background have never sold nearly as well as those set in some pungently remote milieu, far from the middle-class blandness of policemen and accountants, the solid kinder-kirche-kuche reality of May's homeland. Readers wanted from him what he was the first to give them in truly popular form: an epos of the German conquistador bestriding the world at large.\nIt's odd, but the country that was to generate so formidable a nationalism in the 20th century had, until the 19th, few heroic figures to call its own. Britain's ran from King Arthur to Lord Nelson; France had a gallery from Roland to Louis XIV. But Germany? The scattered sagas of the Germanic tribes dramatize the end of Rome rather than the dawn of Teutonia. There is, of course, the story of Frederick Barbarossa, the Hohenstaufen emperor whose red beard grows through a stone table while he sleeps in a cave under Kyffhauser Mountain - until the day he wakes, and with him, German greatness. But it's an inert bit of folklore and purloined at that (originally it applied to Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II, who, half-Sicilian, reigned in Italy and was quite Mediterranean in temper and orientation). By contrast, Frederick the Great, who fashioned Prussia into a redoubtable fighting machine, was a Frenchi-Continued on next page fied epicene who adored Voltaire, called his palace Sans Souci and played the flute on high heels - hardly an icon of German manliness. By the 19th century Germans knew themselves to be respectable, reliable, thorough, knowledgeable and not particularly heroic. At this juncture Richard Wagner and Karl May, born a year apart, went to work.\nPulling the Nibelungs out of medieval mists, Wagner charged them with Teutonic grandeur. But it was May who made patriotism mythic for the man in the street. For every German who can hum a Siegfried aria, 10 will recite Old Shatterhand's sallies. True, there is much more to Wagner's vision than Herrenvolk propaganda, and in his final books May preached a mystical pacifism. Yet both men, on different esthetic levels, helped shape the collective German dream of feats far beyond middle-class bounds - a dream Hitler mobilized into mania.\nOne of the Fuhrer's principal biographers, Joachim Fest, records that the young Hitler liked to dress up as a Karl May character and that later, during his first year as Chancellor, he reread all of May's novels. A tradition that Hitler advised his generals in Russia to carry May as a tacticians' handbook has not been substantiated, but on June 26, 1944, a Berlin newspaper did report that large numbers of German soldiers were grateful to Karl May for providing them with ''the best manuals of anti-partisan warfare.''\nHow peculiar, then, my instinct on reaching America: that I, a Jewish refugee from German conquest, should write ''Old Shatterhand,'' a name prototypical of the conquering German, on my high school locker. How ironic that today I still catch myself sneaking to the corner in my library where my five volumes of Karl May are tucked away, where sachems and sheiks ride in gothic typeface down yellowing pages.\nThere's more than irony to that, more than nostalgia. When I packed my suitcase in Vienna in 1939, I put in my Karl Mays along with my soccer ball and my leather shorts as keepsakes of a home to which there would be no return. But the books were not just mementos. They were also charms. I hoped my trip into strangeness, like Old Shatterhand's, would turn into high romance. Never mind that the people I was fleeing were Old Shatterhand's own, whose valor he glorified. The issue of the moment was survival: for me, Karl May was talismanic because of his hero's triumphant escapes. Even today, seasoned, cynical escapee that I am, I like to open a May novel and watch Old Shatterhand fake a trail that will foil the murderous prospector. I'm in the hands of a master of the genre. He won't enrich me with insights, but he'll bless me with a few therapeutic thrills. For a few young minutes I'll believe once more that life is not tragedy but adventure.

Stockman. (Avon, $4.95.) The former budget director's inside account of how economic policy is made is a ''devastating portrait of high-comedy incompetence and low deceit in the Reagan White House'' as well as ''a valuable document of the American political condition,'' Michael Kinsley said in The Book Review last year.\nTHE TRIUMPH OF POLITICS: The Inside Story of the Reagan Revolution, by David A. Stockman. (Avon, $4.95.) The former budget director's inside account of how economic policy is made is a ''devastating portrait of high-comedy incompetence and low deceit in the Reagan White House'' as well as ''a valuable document of the American political condition,'' Michael Kinsley said in The Book Review last year. THE GOOD APPRENTICE, by Iris Murdoch. (Penguin, $7.95.) Iris Murdoch's novel is the story of two stepbrothers - Edward, a university student who must cope with his guilt and grief after causing a friend's death, and Stuart, who renounces a brilliant career to devote himself to good works. The author has ''authentic spiritual originality,'' Harold Bloom said here last year. ''Miss Murdoch's particular mastery is in representing the maelstrom of falling in love. . . . No other contemporary British novelist seems to me of her eminence. . . . She has earned now the tribute she made to Sartre more than 30 years ago. She too has the style of the age.'' THE FIFTY-MINUTE HOUR: A Collection of True Psychoanalytic Tales, by Robert Lindner. (Delta Diamond, $6.95.) Robert Lindner's portrait of psychoanalysis takes the form of five case studies - including those of a bulimic woman, a rapist-murderer and a schizophrenic scientist. The author ''is a psychoanalyst as well as a fine storyteller,'' our reviewer, Jean Evans, said in 1954. ''In this book the reader learns something about the doctor as well as about his patients, and about the interplay that is psychoanalysis.'' ODESSA BEACH, by Bob Leuci. (Signet/New American Library, $3.95.) One step ahead of the K.G.B., a Russian black marketeer arrives in Brooklyn and muscles in on the mob. This is a Mafia thriller with ''an unusual twist,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year. ''Mr. Leuci is a very good technician who would appear to know a good deal about organized crime in New York. . . . Everything rings true.'' IMMODEST ACTS: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy, by Judith C. Brown. (Oxford University, $6.95.) Benedetta Carlini, a 17th-century nun and mystic, became a powerful abbess but fell into disgrace when she was accused of faking miracles and having a lesbian affair. Her story, based on papers discovered in Florentine archives, is ''fascinating and highly readable,'' Frederika Randall said here a year ago. SELECTED SHORT STORIES OF PADRAIC COLUM, edited by Sanford Sternlicht. (Syracuse University, $12.95.) These 13 early stories by Padraic Colum ''are in the main vignettes, chapters in the lives of the Irish peasantry at the turn of the century,'' Thomas Lask said in The Book Review in 1985. ''The writing is informal, uncluttered, colloquial with those precise images and turns of phrase that could have easily been shaped into formal verse.'' TENDER OFFER: The Sneak Attack in Corporate Takeovers, by Dorman L. Commons. (Penguin, $6.95.) The former chief executive officer of the Natomas Company offers a personal account of its unfriendly takeover by the Diamond Shamrock Corporation. This is ''the most human document to come out of the high-stakes takeover wars,'' Hal Goodman said in these pages in 1985. WHITE WATER, by Joyce Reiser Kornblatt. (Laurel/ Dell, $3.95.) This novel about a family brought together in Miami for a wedding moves with ''energy and narrative conviction,'' Kathryn Morton said in The Book Review in 1985. ''First novels often have problems of shape. But some, like 'White Water,' by the most promising authors, lift the reader over the rough structure on the strength of their wit and insight, the rich sound of voices and the energetic flow of invention.'' THREE CENTURIES OF HARVARD: 1636-1936, by Samuel Eliot Morison. (Belknap/Harvard University, Paper, $9.95. Cloth, $25.) This history of Harvard uses ''precise and luminous strokes'' to tell a story ''rich in details as to the customs and manners of three centuries,'' John Corbin said here in 1936. McKAY'S BEES, by Thomas McMahon. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $5.95.) Set in 1855, Thomas McMahon's novel is populated by scientists and tinkerers, chiefly Gordon McKay, who sets out for Kansas to build a city based on beekeeping. Not one of the characters is a stereotypical scientist, our reviewer, Edmund White, said in 1979. ''Science itself informs the descriptions that run through the novel, and in this regard Mr. McMahon,'' himself a scientist, ''is at his most original.'' THE EVIDENCE NEVER LIES: The Casebook of a Modern Sherlock Holmes, by Alfred Allan Lewis with Herbert Leon MacDonell. (Laurel/Dell, $7.95.) An authority on bloodstains, ballistics and fingerprints, Herbert Leon MacDonell has served as an expert witness in scores of murder cases, seven of which are recounted here. ''All are intriguing,'' one reviewer said in 1984, ''and one only wishes there were more.'' NOBODY'S ANGEL, by Thomas McGuane. (Vintage, $6.95.) The hero of Thomas McGuane's sixth novel, Patrick Fitzpatrick, is a 36-year-old former military officer who comes home to his family's Montana ranch. ''The play of wit is constant and redeeming,'' Vance Bourjaily said in these pages in 1982. NO SENSE OF PLACE: The Impact of Electronic Media on Social Behavior, by Joshua Meyrowitz. (Oxford University, $9.95.) The author examines how electronic media - particularly television - have altered Americans' sense of place and the ways we give and receive social information. In 1985 one reviewer called it a well-written and masterly study, ''a fine combination of perceptive analysis and creative synthesis.''
948	THERE'S A CONTRA IN MY GRUB	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDD173CF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: BANDITS By Elmore Leonard. 345 pp. New York: Arbor House. $17.95.\nBANDITS By Elmore Leonard. 345 pp. New York: Arbor House. $17.95.\nTHE question here is, Why is Elmore Leonard so good? He is. He is as good as the blurbs say:\n''The greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever,'' ''Can't put it down,'' and so on. It's true enough. But how does he do it? Because it looks like he's thrown away the rules of a noble genre. He doesn't stick to the same guy or the same place. I had thought Raymond Chandler wrote the book when he set down Philip Marlowe in Los Angeles, in his lonesome house up Laurel Canyon, stoic and pure-hearted amid the low life of Sunset Boulevard and the bad cops of Bay City, a tough Galahad pitted against some very sleazy barbarians.\nBut look at what Mr. Leonard is doing. Here he is now in New Orleans. I haven't read many of his books, but, as I recall, he's taken on Detroit, Miami Beach, Bal Harbour, Jerusalem, with a different cop or a different tough guy in each place. His New Orleans is done up with meticulous accuracy. The restaurants, streets, bars, hotels are just right - especially a lovely neighborhood restaurant, Mandina's, which tourists have never heard of, and even the funeral home across the street. One imagines Mr. Leonard moving into a city for a couple of weeks, yet doing his research as exhaustively as John Gunther doing another ''Inside'' book. Yet Mr. Leonard's New Orleans lacks the authenticity of Chandler's L.A., which works for Marlowe - and for us - as his very soul's terrain.\nI've often wondered why some good crime writer, local or otherwise, hasn't taken up with New Orleans, what with its special raffishness, its peculiar flavor of bonhomie and a slightly suspect charm. It's got the backdrop: Mafia types and the French Quarter downtown, enough decayed aristocrats uptown, lonesome anonymous suburbs like Gentilly, a greater ethnic mix than Marseilles. There are no ranker patios anywhere. Yet I can't recall a good novel in this genre and only one second-rate television series, ''Bourbon Street Beat.''\nDoes Elmore Leonard do the job in ''Bandits''? The early signs are not auspicious. His hero is an ex-con, a jewel thief turned mortician. The female lead? A good-looking ex-nun just back from Nicaragua where she took care of lepers until the contras hacked them up with machetes. Lepers?\nThe ex-nun wants to smuggle a young Nicaraguan woman - who contracted leprosy and whom her lover, a Somoza-type colonel, is trying to kill for honor's sake and because he thinks she might have given him leprosy - out of Carville, a leprosarium in Louisiana. He is also raising millions from rich Americans to take back to the contras. The ex-jewel thief and his tough ex-con ex-cop friend are out to steal the money that the ex-nun wants so she can help the lepers and the Sandinistas. H'm. When she was a nun, the woman believed in touching people. Why did she quit her vocation? Because, she says, ''I was burnt out.'' ''What does that mean?'' her ex-jewel-thief boyfriend asks. ''I was touching without feeling,'' she explains.\nOh my. What has Mr. Leonard got himself into this time? Nicaraguan politics and a gun-toting ex-nun who touches without feeling? Is it going to be standard Leonard crime and punishment flavored by gumbo and laced with bad contras and good Sandinistas?\nBut wait. Things are not so simple. Who should show up but a Miskito Indian who is working for the contras and who shoots people in the head with his 9-millimeter Beretta. He's a Miskito, and we know, don't we, what the Sandinistas did to the Miskitos.\nA preposterous business this, but we keep turning the pages. Why? Here's one reason. Here's Jack Delaney, ex-con mortician, talking to his tough ex-con ex-cop friend, Roy, who's tending bar. Mr. Leonard has got the bar just right. We know what the bar looks like, what street it looks out on. Jack is telling Roy about the $5 million they can take from the colonel. Roy is mixing a drink, not paying attention. He ventures a remark. ''Delaney, you know what broads do when they get sick? I've never seen it to fail, they throw up in the washbasin. They don't throw up in the toilet, like you're supposed to.'' This gets your attention. What's Roy up to? Jack is telling him about stealing the $5 million from the contras and serving humanity at the same time. Roy is unimpressed by serving humanity. He tells about the humanity he serves at the bar.\n''Guy comes in, looks around, he whispers to me, 'You got any absinthe?' He says, 'They don't have none at the Old Absinthe House. They tell me it's against the law to serve it.' I say how do I know, to this little . . . fella, you're not a cop? He shows me he's from Fort Wayne, Indiana. I glance around the bar, get out a clear bottle I make up that's got Pernod in it and a piece of deadwood with a caterpillar stuck on it. [ He ] drinks five of 'em at five bills a shot. Serve humanity, I serve 'em any . . . thing they want.'' Mr. Leonard has got my attention. You begin to notice his prose, the way he moves people around. People get shot in dependent clauses. Franklin de Dios is the Miskito Indian. '' 'I said I quit,' Franklin said, and shot him.'' The snap and crackle of the dialogue is something to hear. Mr. Leonard's ear is sharp and accurate: ''Jack put on a reasonably stupid grin for Wally Scales and slipped a little bit of West Feliciana Parish into his sound. 'Well, I can't say it was enjoyable, but I come through it, yes sir.' '' Sure enough, folks in West Feliciana Parish, which is next door to where I'm writing, could say that.\nFranklin drives a Chrysler Fifth Avenue. A black New Orleanian can't figure him out - he looks Indian but he's got nappy hair. ''Man, I look at you close I thought you were a brother. You know what I'm saying? I thought you were black.'' ''Yes, one part of me,'' Franklin says. ''The rest Miskito.'' Here's an item for the next doctoral thesis on Mr. Leonard: he often drops the word ''if'' in dialogue - and uses hardly any conjunctions. ''I had a tire iron we could find out in ten minutes.'' This sentence could use an ''if'' and a comma and would be worse for it.\nYes, Mr. Leonard knows what he's doing. In the end he senses that Nicaragua and the gun-toting ex-nun may not be working out here. He backs off. Says Roy, mystified: ''I want to know, for my own information, which are the good guys and which are the bad guys.'' Jack doesn't know either. Mr. Leonard's instincts are good. Nicaraguan politics, it turns out, may be a bit too heavy to be carried by the graceful pas de deux of Mr. Leonard's good guys and bad guys. For this reason, ''Bandits'' is not quite of a piece, like ''Glitz.''\nBut it will do. Mr. Leonard has got his usual diverting cast of grifters and creeps up his sleeve and action as Byzantine as ever Chandler himself thought up. In fact, reading it, I felt like William Faulkner when he was writing the screenplay for the film version of Chandler's novel ''The Big Sleep.'' The story is that he had to call up Chandler to find out what was going on. Chandler wasn't sure.\nYes, it will do.\nLetting the Characters Do It\n''Most thrillers,'' says Elmore Leonard, ''are based on a situation, or on a plot, which is the most important element in the book. I don't see it that way. I see my characters as being most important, how they bounce off one another, how they talk to each other, and the plot just sort of comes along.'' In fact, Mr. Leonard is so comfortable allowing his characters to control the pace and action of his stories that he didn't know how ''Bandits'' would end until three days before he finished it last April.\nMr. Leonard began writing for an advertising agency in 1949 and wrote westerns for two hours each morning before work. He published his first novel, ''The Bounty Hunters,'' in 1953, and sold his first crime novel, ''The Big Bounce,'' along with the movie rights, in 1969. Though he concedes that he writes genre fiction, he does so grudgingly. ''I write about crime, solving crime. But it's not a mystery, and it's not a puzzle. There are certain formats, and it's the same thing over and over, so I try to come up with fresh situations and real people.''\nMr. Leonard's characters are commonly tangled in the seedier fray of a community, whether it be Detroit or Atlantic City. He chose New Orleans for ''Bandits,'' his 24th novel, not only because he was born there in 1925, but also because the place intrigued him. He spent two weeks there researching the city and making notes on the speech of his characters.\n''Until I get to know a character,'' he said recently from his home in Birmingham, Mich., ''the character isn't going to behave properly. I fool around with the dialogue, with how they talk, things they might say. As a scene develops, a character will start to do things on his own, but as soon as I can get a character to talk when I want him to, that's when I feel confident I've got a book. I know that I can mix them up together and something's going to happen. I'm not a strong narrative writer. I'm not especially good with imagery, so I have to let my characters do it. I studied writers who used dialogue well.\n''I studied Hemingway when I was learning to write. You study him closely and you realize all the stuff he leaves out that you think is in the story. That's always interested me - to see the white space on a printed page.'' MICHAEL RUHLMAN

In ''American Musicians: 56 Portraits in Jazz'' (Oxford University), Whitney Balliett quotes the legendary Buddy Rich.\nPlaying a drum solo is like telling a story. It has a beginning, a middle, and . . . a punch line. I try and play a drum solo constructed along a line. What comes out is what I feel. I'm telling you about my wife, my daughter, what nice people I was with before I got on the stand. When Johnny Carson comes in I try and play in that light, funny way he has. When Basie comes in, I play with love. Some nights people tell me I've played vicious, and they're right. Maybe I've been thinking about thirty years of one-nighters or maybe about what a drag it was in the Marines. But the next night I'll come to where I'm playing and say, ''Sorry, little drums, I'll be tender tonight.'' Drums can be as musical as Heifetz. You don't pick up sticks as if they were hammers. It's a matter of using your hands to apply pressure. You apply the power, the beauty. Marilyn, Sartre and Anna Freud Marilyn Monroe attracted irony as well as men. This is from ''Marilyn'' (Holt), by Gloria Steinem, with photographs by George Barris.\nAs an actress, she often objected to playing a ''dumb blonde,'' which she feared would also be her fate in real life, but she might have attempted the ''serious actress'' appeal of playing Cecily, a patient of Sigmund Freud. After all, the director of this movie was John Huston and the screenwriter was Jean-Paul Sartre, who considered Marilyn ''one of the greatest actresses alive.'' Ironically, Dr. Ralph Greenson, a well-known Freudian who was Marilyn's analyst in the last months of her life, advised against it, because, he said, Freud's daughter did not approve of the film. Otherwise, Marilyn would have been called upon to enact the psychotic fate she feared most in real life, and to play the patient of a man whose belief in female passivity may have been part of the reason she was helped so little by psychiatry. Please Don't Iron the Poetry Brave in poetry, Wallace Stevens was timid with women. Writing to his fiancee about his forthcoming visit, he flirts with the idea of being indecorous. This is from ''Wallace Stevens: the Early Years, 1879-1923'' (Beech Tree/Morrow), by Joan Richardson.\nI think it would be nice if we could just spend our time together quietly without attempting or wishing to do much - so that the time itself would seem longer. But that is always so difficult - I want to steep myself in you, if I may use so extraordinary a term - as if you were a South Wind and as if I were - well, a dingy fellow, as I am. You will not be too terribly ironed, will you? Just have a few comfortable things - perhaps pink slippers quite late, and that plate of cakes so that I won't feel at all as if I were making a call. Suppose we could pass quickly through some gates of the imagination and find ourselves? Yes - we must do that at once. - You must not look at me as if you had not seen me for a long time or anything. (A mandoline passes in the street.) Yet it is silly to lay down so many rules. They'll all be broken. There seem to be reservoirs concealed in all of us - even the most sedate - that break unexpectedly. To Be Beau The Academie Francaise is a sort of permanent jury in a perpetual trial of French culture. In ''Mission to Civilize'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich), Mort Rosenblum quotes Jean d'Ormesson, a member of the Academy, on its purpose.\n''What purpose the Academy?'' is one of those recurrent questions posed by imbeciles when they exhaust the charms of the weather. . . . What purpose? Mais, none, like all delicious and somewhat great things. What purposes cats, the Temple of Abu Simbel, the islands of the Italian lakes, the flame roses of the Camargue, military parades and the strutting of animals who wish to dazzle their conquests, the very old oaks of our fields, our memories of happiness? What purpose rites and ceremonies? To the eyes of a world dominated by money, by power in all of its aspects, by collective movements, fleeting and blind, what purpose the Academy? None. None at all. Its purpose is to be beau. Packed With Meaning Like a Van Poets are the perfect travelers, for even if the place is disappointing that too suits their purpose. Here W. H. Auden turns his bloodshot cosmopolitan eye on Brussels. The poem is in ''The Oxford Book of Travel Verse'' (Oxford University), edited by Kevin Crossley-Holland. Wandering through cold streets tangled like old string, Coming on fountains rigid in the frost, Its formula escapes you; it has lost The certainty that constitutes a thing. Only the old, the hungry and the humbled Keep at this temperature a sense of place, And in their misery are all assembled; The winter holds them like an Opera-House. Ridges of rich apartments loom to-night Where isolated windows glow like farms, A phrase goes packed with meaning like a van, A look contains the history of man, And fifty francs will earn a stranger right To take the shuddering city in his arms.

(Ages 12 & up)\nMIDNIGHT HOUR ENCORES By Bruce Brooks. 263 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $13.95. (Ages 12 & up)\nAT 16, Sibilance T. Spooner is a professional cellist. She has won three international music competitions, been a soloist under prominent conductors, performed all over Europe and recorded a few digital albums. When not on tour she lives a comfortable life in Washington with her doting father, Taxi. She has everything a girl could want - except a mother.\nA few months before she is scheduled to pack her bags for Juilliard, Sibilance announces she is finally ready to meet the woman who discarded her at birth. Taxi drops what he is doing and buys a 20-year-old Volkswagen bus which he equips with military surplus gear: duffel bags, tent, mattress - the works. He's in a frenzy to justify to Sibilance the ideology that permitted his wife to abandon both of them; he wants to make her understand the 60's. Sibilance is not amused. When she, who is accustomed to late-model Volvos and American Tourister suitcases, sniffs at the lumpy green duffels, Taxi suggests their usual formal black luggage wouldn't be ''appropriate'' for this particular journey.\n''Appropriate? What are we going to do -invade Cuba?'' his daughter snorts. ''Midnight Hour Encores'' is a narrative in Sibilance's voice; naturally she gives herself all the good lines.\nShe is an arrogant, accomplished child of extraordinary and narrow intelligence; she is a whiz at music, sarcasm and manipulating people, yet does poorly in school, doesn't read books, has no friends and, as it turns out, has deluded herself about her feelings for her nurturing father. Bruce Brooks keeps his heroine's scintillatingly cynical voice consistent throughout, but the tone of this monologue is bound to create difficulties for its intended audience, the MTV generation, one of the objects of his heroine's scorn.\nIt will be difficult for a young reader to cultivate sympathy for a character so flashily contemptuous of pop culture. Most teen-agers don't know the Debussy Quartet from the Ravel; most probably don't care, either. But as Sibilance rattles along snottily, using musical jargon miles beyond the comprehension of the average young adult, she sounds tauntingly superior. This is bound to be off-putting and frequently bewildering. Early in the story, for example, she makes a casual, derogatory comment about ''Ma doing the Bach suites.'' True, that is precisely how a real child-cellist would have articulated the phrase, but most American teen-agers won't have heard of Yo-Yo Ma and will probably deduce that Sibilance is talking about her missing mother - who has been mentioned already on the dust jacket and in the story.\nVan Halen fans aside, there does exist a substantial pool of classically trained students who would relish a novel that reflects their rarefied milieu so unapologetically, but unfortunately ''Midnight Hour Encores'' suffers from inconsistencies sure to alienate the musical child, too. Sibilance blithely states, ''the circle of international music critics puts me about third or fourth in the world right now,'' then proceeds to specify today's most renowned cellists (to whom she considers herself superior). This is an outrageous assertion, even for the most egomaniacal of Juilliard freshmen. Sibilance claims to be a self-made woman, but musically that's impossible. If she has won so many competitions, where is her mentor? Who is her coach? She refers to her beloved first teacher, long dead - but who has helped her get to Brussels, Prague and Rome? No matter how talented, no 16-year-old blossoms into an artistically consummate world-class instrumentalist on her own. To pretend otherwise is an insult to the discipline, and those who study music know this. CONSPICUOUSLY absent from Sibilance's monologue is any consciousness of the business side of her career. Who has booked all the concerts with the major symphonies? Who has negotiated those recording contracts? In an atmosphere where teen-age virtuosos jockey for positions on prestigious rosters and agents cluster like flies around young talent it is inconceivable that Sibilance could produce such a long monologue with no references to this aspect of her life.\nAlso problematic are the discussions about music which sound researched and tend to flatten the natural drama of the story. When Sibilance and Taxi improvise a tone poem, as an homage to the ''Age of Aquarius,'' it does not seem spontaneous. This is a lengthy, pivotal scene, but dull. In his award-winning first novel, ''The Moves Make the Man,'' Mr. Brooks used similar expository techniques with great success - but he was describing basketball, not musical passages. It might be that sports are intrinsically more exciting on paper than classical music - or, more likely, that the author is more excited by sports. In any case, ''Midnight Hour Encores'' lacks the zip of his earlier work and such listlessness obscures what would have been an engaging story about selfishness, self-exploration and self-discovery. One hopes that Mr. Brooks, who has a keen ear for the adolescent voice, will focus his next attempts on a protagonist less pretentious.

Translated by Paul Knight. 388 pp. New York: Carcanet. $16.95.\nWINNER TAKES ALL By Dieter Wellershoff. Translated by Paul Knight. 388 pp. New York: Carcanet. $16.95.\nDIETER WELLERSHOFF's hero, Ulrich Vogtmann, orphaned during World War II, attains manhood in postwar West Germany with no sense of direction and the conviction that ''I am nobody.'' The closest he comes to inspiration is a university lecture that he attends by chance and that leaves him convinced money is ''the life-stuff of the imagination. . . . the universal machine which set all other machines in motion . . . the metabolism of society.'' Through a friend he gets a job at a dairy-product factory owned and run by one Hermann Pattberg. Pattberg, who holds his position by inheritance, is unambitious and only marginally competent, and Vogtmann quickly drifts rather than drives his way to the job of managing director, having meanwhile entered a loveless marriage with the boss's daughter, Elisabeth, after breaking off an affair with an older Yugoslav woman at the very moment she has a messy abortion.\nThereafter, Vogtmann's life is an unmitigated disaster in both commercial and human terms. Gambling to expand the business, he buys a supermarket chain based in Munich, only to discover that he has been taken in the transaction. He tries to recoup with a second, more desperate deal with a promoter of questionable repute - an investment of 1.4 million marks in heavily discounted bills of exchange secured by a quantity of deadly poison pills, intended as insecticide for use in Zaire.\nVogtmann's marriage deteriorates; his alcoholic brother-in-law tries to kill him and then commits suicide; his son becomes a shoplifter and writes ''NO FUTURE'' in huge letters on the main building of the school he attends, and Vogtmann carries on a listless affair with a frivolous woman in Munich. When political unrest in Zaire makes the bills of exchange worthless, the Pattberg firm is ruined and the story moves to its predictable conclusion. Through this gloomy narrative, we spend a lot of time with Vogtmann in hotel rooms, on superhighways in his silver-gray Mercedes and at business and business-social meetings. Many weather fronts pass over West Germany, and the storms they bring are duly recorded. Where American novels of business are apt to glitter with ingenious technical detail but are weak on character and description, this one focuses on the true material of fiction, and properly keeps information on commercial method in the background.\nThe reader ends with the feeling of having been with Vogtmann, perhaps even of having been Vogtmann, for a time. But the feeling is depressing. One is reminded not, as the publisher hopes, of Thomas Mann's ''Buddenbrooks,'' but rather of Zola. Mr. Wellershoff, a West German novelist, essayist and dramatist who has been rendered here in a readable translation by Paul Knight, offers effective descriptions of furniture and mood and squalor (in this case the squalor not of poverty but of affluence), as well as rather heavy-handed symbolism: Vogtmann, who literally deformed his feet by wearing too-tight shoes in his youth, has deformed his adult soul by making a god of money. But, in literary art if not in life, Zola's time has gone, and the poetry even Zola managed is missing here.\nSociologically, this is surely the dark side of Germany's economic miracle: while West Germany rose with Western aid from the ashes of war to world leadership, greedy, empty men were destroying themselves and all they touched, there as elsewhere. The fact that ''Winner Takes All'' was a best seller in West Germany suggests that Vogtmann's story has a contemporary resonance in that country.

Translated, and with an introduction, by David Rattray. 135 pp. San Francisco: North Point Press. Paper, $11.95.\nDIFFICULT DEATH By Rene Crevel. Translated, and with an introduction, by David Rattray. 135 pp. San Francisco: North Point Press. Paper, $11.95.\nTHIS volume, previously unavailable in English, appears more than 50 years after Rene Crevel's suicide, and a great deal of special pleading occurs, both in the translator's introduction and the deeply incoherent and self-regarding foreword by Salvador Dali, before the reader is allowed to make his own judgments. One has a strong suspicion that the decision to issue the novel for an English-speaking market has to do with a perceived topicality in Crevel's homosexual inclinations.\nYet the overemphasis on the more sensational aspects of his life - which are indeed closely paralleled by events in ''Difficult Death'' - does the novelist in the end less than justice. What is noteworthy in this work, quite elegantly translated by David Rattray, is precisely the intellectual and stylistic clarity with which personal relationships are portrayed, a clarity that owes more to the tradition of self-examination in French literature than it does to the contemporaneous trends of Surrealism, a Hydra-like beast if ever there was one.\nCrevel at 26 was capable of analyzing, in meticulous detail, such diverse emotional situations as the middle-aged viciousness, over tea, between Mme. Blok (sensualist) and Mme. Dumont-Dufour (chastiser of the flesh); the mesmerized distress of the hero, Pierre, as he watches his American lover clasped in an explicit embrace by a young street boy; and, most remarkable of all, in the lucid rapidity of mood change and subtlety of psychological motivation, Pierre's attempts to communicate an essentially platonic feeling to a woman who persistently refuses to acknowledge realities.\nSuch extreme attention to detail contradicts the conventional definition of Surrealism as primarily involved with the subconscious; on the contrary, Crevel's achievement lies in presenting the quirky, the sexually tormented, the insane, not so much as aberration or eccentricity, but as a reality no less possible than the quite clearly manic war cry of Mme. Dumont-Dufour against her certified husband - ''All aboard for Ratapoilopolis!''\nWhat the novel does not provide is psychological development. Crevel is not interested in a strong narrative peg on which to hang his observations. Again, one is reminded of the surgical, but unmistakably adolescent, sensitivity of the early 19th-century novelist Benjamin Constant as much as the antirationalism of full-blown Surrealists. This makes Crevel a complex figure, but not necessarily a rounded one: the conclusion of ''Difficult Death'' leaves one wondering exactly why this death is difficult, and, indeed, why it is seen as a solution to the hero's very egocentric problems at all.

Suggestions, mostly facetious, have ranged from Iranamuck to Gipperdammerung; it is as if a scandal without an agreed-upon label lacks the identity that turns a story into history. However, the grand tradition of Credit Mobilier, Teapot Dome and Watergate, and corruption's lesser symbolic tradition of Deepfreezes and vicuna coats, has been interrupted this time. Perhaps because there are too many suggested names, or because the scandal has not found a locus (Arms-for-hostages? Secret dealings wrongly withheld from Congress? Diversion of funds?), the business of naming the scandal is in more disarray than the Reagan Administration, which is saying plenty.\nWorse, grisly grammarians in the media are having trouble getting universal acceptance for a noun to describe the current state of affairs. The New York Times has a series of pages devoted daily to what it calls the White House crisis, a neutral term; some political observers with memories of Truman days prefer the most descriptive but less objective mess. Nobody turned to caper, the original brushoff of the Watergate break-in, because that word is too lighthearted.\nBlunder stumbled on the scene, had a brief moment at the start, but was soon replaced by the more resounding fiasco. That ringing term may come from the Late Latin flasco, meaning ''bottle,'' which was associated in slang with the actions taken in drunkenness, and came to mean ''a grandiose plan that flops.'' Fiasco became the only acceptable vogue term for the aborted invasion at the Bay of Pigs, but the noun was soon replaced; the switch to scandal took place when the story of ransom payments was given a new dimension by the disclosure of the diversion of arms profits to the contras.\nFriends of the President are still clinging to imbroglio, an Italian word meaning ''confused, noisy embroilment,'' from the Old French brouiller, ''to broil,'' which meant ''to be in disorder.'' It long meant a confused heap: ''I keep my prints an imbroglio,/ Fifty in one portfolio,'' wrote the poet Robert Browning; now the metaphor has been extended to mean any complicated dispute from which extrication is difficult. However, the idea of embroilment carries neither the drunken stupidity of fiasco nor the venality of scandal, which is why Mr. Reagan's defenders like imbroglio.\nThe President chose an Americanism of obscure origin to give a less serious, more high-spirited connotation to the activity. In a radio address, he asked rhetorically: ''Were we engaged in some kind of shenanigans that blew up in our face?'' That word, first spotted in an 1855 San Francisco publication - ''Are you quite sure? No shenanigan?'' - has a jocular cast of kidding around, perhaps to the point of madcap skulduggery. Only the President has suggested it applies here. Somewhat Vulgar WHEN MAY A NEWSPA-per properly use the slang verb to pee?\nJohn Irving, the novelist, called me a few months ago to protest a decision made by The New York Times not to use that widely used euphemism in a book review he had written of ''Seven Rivers West,'' by Edward Hoagland.\nOne of the characters in the lusty tale, which Mr. Irving reviewed favorably, is a trader known for his prowess in long-distance urinating. The reviewer felt it important to refer to the character and his talent. Although authors of the stature of John Irving are cited in dictionaries to illustrate the development and acceptance of words, the following line was published in the Book Review section of The Times: ''The wild journey that only Cecil and Margaret manage to finish ends outside the tent of a trader who's famous for winning bladder-voiding competitions.''\n''The word I wrote was peeing,'' Mr. Irving affirms. ''Totally inoffensive word - a euphemism, in fact, for pissing, a perfectly good English word. To me, bladder-voiding is repellent.'' Grumbling, he went along with the stylistic suggestion, because he wanted the sentence in the review, but wanted me to know that was not his style.\nI have been noodling that over. Pee is certainly the gentlest of euphemisms, but it is a slang term, and once a publication admits the use of slang in describing bodily functions, it assaults the ramparts of taste. Newspapers that respect their readers' intelligence do not shy from such Standard English words as urinate - it was used in a Times front-page subhead recently in connection with drug testing - but draw the line against using slang words to denote the same function.\nIf the judgment were mine, I would ban pee, not because it is slang but because it is a baby-talk euphemism; instead, I would accept the word for which it substitutes as Standard English (that dread word will be avoided here as ''vulgar''), but most people do not feel as strongly as I do about euphemisms.\nIt's a close call; I am reluctant to condemn editors as bowdlerists who argue that where standard words are available, slang or vulgarisms should be avoided. In Webster's New World Dictionary, however, pee is held to be only ''somewhat vulgar'' and the ''somewhat'' opens the door.\nThen along came Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of New York, whose 1986 campaign for re-election included an episode that bears directly on this issue. Governor Cuomo, whose early refusal to debate his opponent drew some criticism, was appearing on a radio talk show that took telephone calls from the public. One of the callers was his opponent, Andrew O'Rourke, who sought to engage him in impromptu debate, and the Governor cut him off.\nAsked to explain his refusal to continue the conversation, Mr. Cuomo was quoted in The Daily News as saying: ''I'm on the radio, minding my business. A guy tries to hit me from behind; he calls up without telling us, and pees on my shoe.''\nShould that comment be reported? Yes. A way of reporting it without direct quotation, to avoid printing the slang term, would be this: ''The Governor objected to his opponent's surprise call by comparing it to bladder-voiding on his shoe.'' But that would be silly. Governor Cuomo is a public person making a public statement, on the record. He may one day be President of the United States; if he says ''pees on my shoe,'' that comment deserves to be recorded as much as a picture of Nelson A. Rockefeller making a motion with his middle finger to a crowd of protesters (and that ''single-digit salute'' was printed everywhere).\nWhat lesson can we draw from these two instances? That pee is now O.K. to use? No; that's too simple. Safire's Law (I write the ''laws,'' but I don't edit the paper) is this: Slang terms describing bodily functions that can understandably be denoted with standard words should be avoided when possible, but not when such avoidance becomes labored or ludicrous; also, when relatively inoffensive slang terms are used by a responsible and directly quotable news source, such terms may be used in context within quotation marks.\nJohn Irving and Mario Cuomo, like the Colonel's Lady and Rosie O'Grady, have under their skins a common zest for the way people speak in real life. Their audiences are not shocked. Without abandoning our standards - indeed, while vigorously resisting most vulgarisms and barnyard epithets as falsely emphatic and in bad taste - I think we should make it possible for artists and political figures to express themselves colloquially.

It was silly to keep on fussing over something that happened seven years ago when so many present-day problems can be solved if we cooperate. No, I never heard the old Iranian saying about having to kidnap a few embassies to make an omelet. You in the East are lucky to have so much ancient wisdom to guide you. We are a new country where people think they've heard something wise when somebody says, ''Shoot the sherbert to me, Herbert.'' Yours sincerely, etc.\nDEAR MR. PRESIDENT: While enjoying the excellent magazine article extolling supply-side economics, which you so kindly enclosed, I was overwhelmed by remorse at not having sent you a comparable gift demonstrative of my affection. I trust you will find the enclosed not unworthy. Gratefully yours, etc. P.S. My translators are puzzled by ''sherbert.'' Its use in connection with a shooting makes me wonder: Might it be a new weapon in your great arsenal of freedom fighting? If so, perhaps you would send a few ''sherberts'' for my inspection.\nDEAR AYATOLLAH: By golly, it was swell of you to send me the movie about all those fellows being shot, just like in ''Rambo.'' As a guy who was in the industry a long time, can I suggest you tell your producers they can get a nice change of pace by adding some love interest and a few laughs? Who were all those fellows getting shot, anyhow?\n''Sherbert'' is a deliberate misspelling of ''sherbet,'' because saying, ''Shoot the sherbet to me, Herbert,'' isn't half as much fun as saying, ''Shoot the sherbert to me, Herbert.'' All best, etc.\nDEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I have ordered fervent street demonstrations in praise of your kindness for enclosing the film ''Brother Rat,'' which relates the history of your heroic struggle to succeed at V.M.I. Having watched it myself, I venture to reciprocate with some cinema advice of my own. When your life story is filmed, insist that the great Cary Grant play Ronald Reagan. Incidentally, can you send me ''Bringing Up Baby'' with the great Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn? I am not much for documentaries like ''Brother Rat,'' vital though they are to the masses for an understanding of great men.\nWith all due respect, my friend, those being shot in the film I sent you were scarcely what I would call ''fellows.'' Most were economists, and the rest were malcontents. As for ''sherbet,'' is it merely an icy confection, as my translators say, or is it also the coded Pentagon name for a new weapon such as I might be interested in examining? Yours in fanhood, etc. P.S. Why do we remain so formal when our letters so clearly demonstrate we were always destined to become pen pals? My first name is Ruhollah, and my friends call me Ru. Won't you?\nDEAR RU: I am sorry to tell you Cary Grant is dead. As a result, there has been a rush on his films at the video rental shops, so I can't get hold of ''Baby.'' I hope the enclosed will keep you entertained for now.\nAm checking the Pentagon to see if they have something called ''Sherbet'' on the drawing board. Will let you know soonest. Meantime, just call me Ronnie. Your pal, etc.\nDEAR RONNIE: I hope my praise for Cary Grant did not inadvertently give offense. If you were compelled to have him shot for harboring ambitions to become an economist, I quite understand. I may be an Ayatollah, but I am still human enough to feel embarrassment if I thoughtlessly offend a pal.\nThanks for sending ''Knute Rockne - All-American,'' though I detested it. Why? Because the producer allowed Pat O'Brien to steal the film from my great friend Ronnie. Persuade this O'Brien to visit Iran, and I assure you he will be instantly incarcerated, given a fair trial, and shot.\nHeard anything yet from the Pentagon? Devotedly, etc.\nDEAR RU: Bad news from the Pentagon, I'm afraid. There's no weapon called ''Sherbet.'' Not much other news here, except that Pat O'Brien died three years ago. As always, etc.\nRONNIE, BABY: Be a real pal and ask the Pentagon if they've got something called ''Herbert'' coming on line, will you? I hear they sometimes hold out on you unless they think you've got their number. Perhaps you should have more of them shot. Yours in eternal friendship, etc.

It was then that Gabriel, age 20, glanced to one side of Neve Shalom Synagogue and saw the terrorist standing in the doorway.\nThe terrorist looked about as old as Gabriel. He wore sunglasses and was dressed in black.\nGabriel blinked. The terrorist opened fire. Gabriel, who was seated next to his father near the front of the temple, dropped to the floor and hid under a bench. As the terrorist sprayed the synagogue with machine-gun fire, Gabriel felt his father slump down next to him, his face turned away.\nGabriel played dead as the deafening sound of machine-gun fire echoed through the vast, newly renovated synagogue. Bodies fell around him. Screams and moans of the worshipers gave way to the voices of the two terrorists yelling instructions at each another in a language Gabriel thought was Arabic. He felt wet and glanced down at his clothes. He was lying in blood.\nHe lay there, motionless, as the terrorists circled the room, firing more bullets into the bodies to insure that the Jews were dead. The terrorist approached his bench. The man in black sprinkled something on his father's leg - a clear fluid that smelled faintly of gasoline.\nThe terrorist struck a match and set Gabriel's father's leg on fire. ''I realized my father was dead when his leg was burning, but he didn't move,''\nGabriel said.\nGABRIEL SHAUL IS ONE OF seven Jews who survived the terrorist attack last Sept. 6 at Neve Shalom, Istanbul's largest synagogue, whose name means ''oasis of peace.'' The others who had gone there for Saturday services to pray - 22 people, aged 30 to 82 - all were killed. Four months have passed since the Istanbul synagogue massacre and in capitals throughout the West, the verdict of responsibility has been assigned. The incident, it is widely believed, has all the earmarks of Abu Nidal.\nAbu Nidal, the nom de guerre of Sabry al-Banna, a Palestinian born in Jaffe in 1937, is said to head the Middle East's deadliest terrorist organization. A United States State Department report on the group issued early last year attributes more than 60 terrorist attacks to Abu Nidal in the last eight years, 30 since the beginning of 1984; 20 of the 1985 attacks were in Western Europe. The experts agree that Abu Nidal's group, which calls itself the Fatah Revolutionary Council, was involved in the synagogue massacre, but few who have examined the evidence believe that any single terrorist group could have carried out the attack without state-sponsored logistical support.\nIndeed, a six-week investigation by this reporter of the attack on the Sabbath worshippers - which turned the elegant Neve Shalom Synagogue into a charred and blood-stained slaughterhouse - points to a far more disturbing conclusion. Interviews with terrorism experts in Paris, London, Jerusalem and Istanbul suggest that the massacre was carried out not by one group, but by several, with the assistance of more than one govern= ment, acting together and sharing responsibilities and a division of terrorist labor.\nTHE ISTANBUL SYNAGOGUE massacre, these sources now believe, reflects the perfection of a new brand of cooperative international terrorism that attempts to leave no fingerprints and whose sponsors are intended to have no address. The evidence to back up this conclusion, while circumstantial, is persuasive. It includes clearly marked Communist-bloc weapons found at the synagogue and at the sites of other terrorist attacks in Turkey, plus information from a terrorist under arrest in Pakistan. This, along with the evidence provided by ballistics, terrorist interrogators, surveillance of clandestine shipments in diplomatic pouches, all point to three states as possible sponsors of the Istanbul carnage: Syria, Libya and Iran.\nTerrorism experts have conflicting scenarios, and are deeply divided over which country played the leading role in staging the synagogue attack. Israeli experts tend to blame Syria; the Turkish intelligence agency believes that Iran played the dominant role; Turkish police suspect Libya. Some American analysts believe that all three were deeply involved.\nAn Israeli terrorism expert notes that cooperation in the logistics of terrorism has been seen before. ''Libya buys, stores and distributes weapons through its pouch; Syria provides the logistical intelligence and training needed for such an attack; Iran provides the suicide commandos and some funding,'' he said.\nAmerican intelligence analysts believe that both Syria and Iran played a role in the murderous 1983 attack on the United States Marine barracks in Lebanon, and that Syria, as well as Libya, was involved in the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque last year.\nPublicly accusing Syria, Libya and Iran of involvement in the synagogue attack could have painful consequences for the Turkish Government. Turkey has long borders with Syria and Iran and has $3 billion in construction projects in Libya, money that Ankara desperately needs.\nTurkey is not alone in its discomfiture. The Reagan Administration is currently embroiled in a major crisis over clandestine arms shipments to Iran, the last of which was made in October, just a month after the Neve Shalom massacre.\nSo for the moment, it is easier for Turkey, as well as for the United States, to blame the elusive Abu Nidal. (Box, page 47).\n''Ask yourself a question,'' said one Israeli terrorism expert who has followed the Turkish investigation closely. ''If a young Irish woman had gotten aboard that El Al jet in London last April, if she and her unborn baby and some 375 other passengers had been blown to bits over Austria, if we had never learned that there was a Palestinian named Hindawi who could be traced directly to Syria's doorstep, whom do you think we would have blamed for the bombing?'' the expert said. ''It would have been blamed on Abu Nidal.''\n''When an attack succeeds,'' he concluded, ''it's Abu Nidal. When it fails, we discover that it was Syria, or Iran, or Libya.''\nAlthough unwilling to declare its suspicions publicly because of diplomatic pressures and fear of further terrorist incidents, Turkey has recently taken highly unusual steps to thwart future terrorist attacks. In November, Ankara quietly expelled a Syrian diplomat and two diplomats from Iran suspected of involvement in the 1985 murder of a Jordanian diplomat - also blamed on Abu Nidal. Though it was never said publicly, the diplomats were also suspected by some Turkish officials of complicity in the Istanbul synagogue massacre.\nALTHOUGH IT IS surrounded by Arab and Moslem states and 99 percent of its people are Moslems, Turkey was one of the first states in the region to recognize Israel, back in early 1950. The Israeli flag flies openly over its consulate in Ankara, the capital, and Turkey, whose 22,000 Jews have been relatively well treated over the centuries, has open, but low-key commercial and tourist exchanges with Israel. There are also important but unpublicized forms of cooperation between the countries. Turkish and Israeli police and intelligence agents, for example, often work closely together.\nWithin hours after the attack on the Neve Shalom Synagogue, therefore, Israeli and American experts were working quietly with Turkish police, hunting for clues to the identity of the terrorists, combing through the debris, interrogating witnesses to the attack. What soon became frighteningly clear was that they had precious little to go on.\n''This was a highly professional operation,'' said Yildirim Akbulut, Turkey's Minister of the Interior, in an interview in Ankara. Professionalism, in this case, meant that almost no clues to the identity of the terrorists were left behind. Nevertheless, the Turkish police and the Turkish intelligence agency soon came to some preliminary conclusions.\nFirst, Interior Minister Akbulut says that the operation was almost certainly a suicide mission.\nAccording to initial press reports, the terrorists had attacked the synagogue's congregation with hand grenades and machine guns. But the investigation by Turkey has revealed that the terrorists killed worshippers with machine-gun bullets; they reserved the hand grenades for blowing themselves up after they had completed their grisly mission. What is more, survivors said that the terrorists barred an interior door of the synagogue, which leads investigators to believe that no one, including the terrorists, was meant to escape.\nThe terrorists' grenades were extremely powerful and, some intelligence agents believe, may have had specially rigged short fuses for immediate detonation rather than the standard three- to five-second delay that enables a grenade to be aimed and thrown. The force of the blasts blew apart the terrorists' bodies, splattering pieces of their flesh everywhere on the synagogue's freshly stuccoed and painted walls.\nThe grenades so mangled the terrorists' bodies that identification proved extremely difficult. One terrorist apparently held his grenade close to his head, which Turkish police found blasted into the top of the synagogue's vaulted ceiling, more than 40 feet overhead.\nThe second terrorist - and Turkish police believe there were only two assailants inside the synagogue - held the grenade to his stomach. All that remained of him were a mutilated torso and head, and the remnants of two legs, below the knees.\nBased on this information, plus descriptions of the terrorists provided by eyewitnesses inside the synagogue - among them, Gabriel Shaul -Turkish police made composite drawings of their faces, which were published in all the Turkish newspapers.\nTo prevent identification of the country in which the terrorists' clothes had been purchased, the labels of every item of clothing had been cut out, apparently with a razor blade.\nSaffet Arikan Beduk, chief of the Turkish police and Director General for Security, said that his agents had found two clues suggesting that the assailants had been in Turkey for at least a day or two, and probably longer, before the massacre: a pair of Turkish-made tennis shoes on one of the terrorists, and a Turkish-made towel that had been used to cover the top of the satchel in which the terrorists, posing as photographers, had carried their machine guns and grenades into the synagogue.\nMr. Beduk said that his agents had visited almost every store where that brand of towel and tennis shoes were sold - literally ''hundreds of stores,'' he said. ''We've had no luck.''\nOne police investigator said that the authorities had also concluded, despite the scant information available, that the terrorists were definitely Moslems, probably Arabs. ''First, Jews in the synagogue heard them speaking Arabic,'' said a Western agent close to the investigation. ''Second,'' he added, ''autopsies showed that they were both circumcised.'' Moslems, like Jews, insist on this practice for religious reasons.\nPolice painstakingly pieced together the extant parts of the two terrorists' bodies, including tiny pieces of the fingers of one of the murderers to obtain partial fingerprints. These prints, along with actual photographs of the head of one assailant and the drawings of both, were sent to Interpol, the French-based international crime-fighting organization. But Western officials confirm that the agency has not been able to provide a positive identification of either terrorist.\nNevertheless, Turkish police recently scored something of a breakthrough when a vital tip was provided by Pakistan, which has close ties with Turkey. The day before the Istanbul massacre, four terrorists stormed and attempted to hijack a Pan American jet at the airport in Karachi before they were overcome by Pakistani commando units.\nAlthough one of the terrorists carried a Libyan passport and is believed to be a Libyan national, Pakistani police and intelligence officials say that the hijackers are Palestinians trained in Lebanon and that some of them have links to Abu Nidal.\nDuring their interrogation, which is believed to have been physically punishing, Pakistani police showed the composite drawing of the two Istanbul terrorists to the hijackers. One of the hijackers claimed to recognize one of the photos. He told Pakistani police that it was of an Arab, one of the young men who had been trained in Syrian-controlled Lebanon - by Abu Nidal. The hijacker said he had never known the dead man's name or country of origin, but he recognized him by a peculiar scar on what was left of his face.\nANOTHER IMPORTANT clue to the sponsors of the synagogue attack was the weapons that the terrorists left behind. Turkish police found more than 100 spent cartridges on the floor of the synagogue, two machine guns that they said were Polish-made, and seven unexploded Soviet-made grenades, a few of which were apparently defective.\nThese weapons, some of which were the same type as those found in an attempted bombing of an American officers' club in Ankara last spring, have prompted Turkish police to suspect Libyan involvement in the synagogue raid.\nLibyan sponsorship of terrorism in Turkey has been a politically thorny problem for the Turks, Western officials said and Turkish authorities acknowledged. Turkish intelligence agencies have long kept Libya's diplomats under careful surveillence. Months before the attack on the synagogue, Turkish officials were quietly monitoring the weapons, false passports and identification papers that Libya routinely sent into Turkey through embassy pouches and mail.\nAfter the United States bombed Tripoli in April in reprisal for suspected Libyan-sponsored terrorism, Turkey, fearing that Libya would try to strike at the United States through its substantial military presence in Turkey, stepped up this routine surveillance of Libyan diplomats and offices.\nThree days after the American bombing, two Libyans who had been loitering at the United States officers' club in Ankara were arrested and charged with attempting to blow up the club by planting grenades on the building's roof. The grenades they were carrying, like those in the synagogue, were Soviet-made.\nSoon after the arrests at the officers' club, Robert Strausz-Hupe, United States Ambassador to Turkey, visited Turkish officials and demanded action against Libya's Ambassador, the deputy chief of mission and the head of the consulate in Ankara.\nThe American Ambassador gave the Turks evidence that these three Libyan diplomats had been involved in the bungled terrorist attack on the officers' club. ''The Americans presented irrefutable proof that the weapons for the raid had been stored and distributed by the Libyans,'' said one Western source. ''They demanded the immediate expulsion of all three and asked Turkey to close the People's Bureaus'' - the name Libya uses for its diplomatic offices.\nFearful of angering Libya through a public expulsion, Turkey quietly prevailed upon Libya to withdraw its emissaries. In midsummer, Libyan Ambassador Mohammad Abdul Malik, who was expelled from the United States in 1980 for similar terrorist activities and from Switzerland in 1983, and Ali M. Al-Zayyani, his deputy, left Turkey for ''reassignment.'' The consul in Ankara has remained.\nIn November, Mr. Malik quietly returned to Turkey, ostensibly to buy some property for a nephew. As of mid-December, he was still in Ankara, Western sources said.\nThe grenades found on the terrorists outside the officers' club were the same make and model as those found inside the Neve Shalom Synagogue, Chief of Police Beduk confirmed in an interview.\nAbout a month before the Istanbul massacre, Turkish police found a cache of weapons - grenades and machine guns - in a satchel in the Belgrade Forest, a wooded area on the outskirts of Istanbul. The weapons had clearly been left for a covert pickup, according to Turkish police.\nThe police staked out the site for a month. When no (Continued on Page 32) pickup occurred, they recovered the bag shortly before the synagogue attack and analyzed the grenades and machine guns. What intrigued them were the machine guns. They weapons came in four parts, presumably to be assembled by their users. The serial numbers had been scratched out. In their place was a hand-carved number; the same number had been etched into each part of the machine gun, with a different number for each gun. This, Turkish police say, would enable the terrorists to smuggle the pieces in individually; they could then be collected and assembled shortly before use.\nPolice Chief Beduk said the two machine guns found inside the Neve Shalom Synagogue also had their serial numbers removed. On one of the guns, the number ''11'' had been hand-etched into each of its four parts. Both sets of weapons were 9-millimeter, rapid-fire Makarov models.\nBy subjecting the weapons found in the Belgrade Forest and those found at the synagogue to infrared analysis, Turkish police, with Western assistance, were able to identify the original serial numbers of the guns. According to Mr. Beduk, there could be no doubt that the weapons were from the same series.\nThe grenades found in the forest were the same type as those used at the synagogue. They were also the same type as those found at the failed Libyan attack against the American officers' club. Those grenades had been supplied by Libya.\nY ET ANOTHER CLUE to the origins of the synagogue massacre was developed during an investigation by the Turkish police of an earlier terrorist attack - the murder in July 1985 of Ziad al-Sati, a first secretary at the Jordanian Embassy in Ankara who is a relative of Zaid Bin Shaker, a senior Jordanian military officer and King Hussein's closest friend and adviser. The identity of the killers was only recently discovered, thanks to the synagogue investigation.\nAfter the synagogue attack, Turkish police rounded up for questioning more than 80 of the some 2,500 to 3,000 Palestinians in Turkey. In November, Turkish authorities formally charged six of them with the murder of Mr. Sati. All six Palestinian students, the indictment stated, had confessed to being members of the Abu Nidal group, which, the prosecutor alleged officially for the first time, had also carried out the synagogue attack.\nBut Abu Firaz, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Ankara, asserted that the students had been ''tortured'' into making their confessions. P.L.O. sources say the arrests enraged Abu Firaz because the students had been working for him. Their mission, the P.L.O. says, was to infiltrate the Abu Nidal group for Abu Firaz, so that he could help Turkish police smash the organization in Turkey, which had attempted four times to kill him and other P.L.O. officials here.\nSome experts suspect that Abu Firaz may be a double agent - that he works not only for the P.L.O., but also for Abu Nidal, the P.L.O.'s sworn enemy.\n''Here is a good example of why it's impossible in this part of the world to know who is working for whom,'' said Ertugrul Ozkok, Ankara bureau chief of Hurriyet, a leading Turkish newspaper.\nWhomever they were working for, the arrested students (Continued on Page 36) provided Turkish police with information that led directly to the Syrian and Iranian Embassies.\nIn mid-November, the Turks arrested Adnan Ameri, a translator at the Jordanian Embassy who confessed to having worked for Syrian intelligence. His control officer, he said, was a Syrian diplomat in Turkey who had given the order to have Mr. Sati assassinated. Syria, Mr. Ameri said in a public statement, had ordered the Abu Nidal group to carry out the murder.\nOn Nov. 21, Mohammed Darwichi Baladi, a second secretary at the Syrian Embassy, left Turkey only hours before a prosecutor accused him publicly of involvement in the Sati murder.\nAli Kent, a Turk of Iranian origin, was arrested at the same time as Mr. Ameri. He had rented the car used to gun down the Jordanian.\nMr. Kent identified himself as the chief administrator and liaison for Islamic Jihad, the Lebanese-based Shiite Moslem extremist group that has close ties to Iran. His goal, he said, was to destabilize Turkey and spread the fervor of the Iranian revolution there. Working closely with Syria, along with Iranian cover groups, Mr. Kent said that he had staged many clandestine operations in Turkey.\nIn late December, two Iranian diplomats left Turkey at the Turkish Government's request. A statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said only that the two had abused their diplomatic status by attempting to ''recruit men to fight against the Turkish secular system.''\nThe indictments against Mr. Ameri and Mr. Kent mark the first time that members of the Abu Nidal group and of the extremist Iranian-dominated Islamic Jihad organization have been publicly linked to a terrorist attack in Turkey. While the charge against them is the murder of a Jordanian diplomat, Turkish officials now suspect that a similar collaboration took place in the staging of the Istanbul synagogue massacre.\nTurkish and Western officials cite ample motive for Syrian and Iranian involvement in the Neve Shalom attack. Relations between Syria and Turkey have long been strained by Turkey's belief that Damascus has been training and arming Armenian terrorists, known by the acronym ASALA, and infiltrating them across the border and into Western Europe for attacks against Turkey and Turkish targets.\nSyria, moreover, is obsessed with stopping Turkey's construction of the Ataturk Dam, a 2,400-megawatt dam on the Euphrates River. When completed in the early 1990's, Ataturk, along with two other Turkish dams, would have the capability of cutting off most of Syria's source of fresh water and electricity, should Ankara choose to do so.\nAmong the names and items Turkish police found in the apartment of Mr. Ameri, Syria's confessed agent, according to officials, were maps of the dams on the Euphrates, plus a notebook containing records of payments to three Turkish night guards at one of the dams. Police have arrested all three guards, Turkish officials say.\nRelations between Iran and Turkey are equally troubled, if not more so. Iran is a major supporter of the insurgent Kurdish Workers Party, known as P.K.K., which has been fighting to establish independence from Turkey and Iraq, Iran's bitter enemy in their protracted war. Teheran was enraged, diplomatic sources say, when Turkish planes bombed a P.K.K. camp in Iraq last summer, destroying huge caches of Iranian-supplied equipment.\nFinally, Turkey, a Western-oriented secular republic, is an alternative political and economic model of development for the Middle East, one that could prove more attractive to the world's Moslems than the Ayatollah Khomeini's authoritarian Islamic regime. Ankara bitterly resents Iran's infiltration into Turkey of fundamentalist proponents and literature.\nThe Turkish Government feels that it must be cautious with both of its neighbors. Some 3,500 trucks travel between Iran and Turkey each day. Turkish officials admit to the presence of some 20,000 Iranians in Turkey. But Western authorities said that the total is actually between a million and 2 million. If Iran began a serious attempt to destabilize Turkey, (Continued on Page 47) preventive action would be extremely difficult.\nThus Turkey has chosen to play down the strains with Damascus and Teheran. This means that rather than publicly expelling known terrorists operating under diplomatic cover, such agents are quietly pressed to leave. In some cases, nothing is done.\nBut Syria and Iran must also be cautious in their dealings with Ankara, which has a large military establishment, a well-trained army, and a well-deserved reputation for toughness. So rather than stage terrorist activities openly, Western intelligence (Continued on Page 52) and Turkish officials say, Syria and Iran prefer to use surrogates for their more daring operations. Iran's is Islamic Jihad, among others. The most prominent among Syria's terrorist surrogates is Abu Nidal.\nI N AN INTERVIEW IN the Bekaa Valley, Atef Abu Bakr, Abu Nidal's spokesman, said that the group always claimed responsibility for its actions; it has not claimed the synagogue attack.\nAnd while Abu Nidal has sent many young terrorists on missions from which there was little likelihood of return, such as the December 1985 attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports, he has not been known to stage overt suicide missions.\nIt is this fact that has led some counterterrorism experts to doubt that Abu Nidal's group alone is responsible for the synagogue massacre. Just as individual members of Islamic Jihad and the Abu Nidal group appear to have cooperated in the murder of the Jordanian diplomat last year, individuals from these two groups, paid by the sponsors, Iran and Syria and Libya, may have joined forces, or shared tasks, in the Istanbul attack, some experts believe.\nSuch cooperation would be unusual, experts note, but not unprecedented. Robert B. Oakley, recently appointed by Frank C. Carlucci to head the National Security Council's office of Middle East affairs, said there were reliable reports that Syria and Iran had both helped stage the attack in late 1983 against the American Marine barracks in Lebanon, in which more than 240 Marines died.\nThis kind of fluid interchange of surrogates and host countries seems to be on the rise. In the twin attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports in late 1985, terrorist experts believe there is evidence of participation by Syria, Libya and Palestinians from the Bekaa Valley.\nThe bombing attack in April of the La Belle discotheque in West Berlin, in which two American soldiers were killed, seems to have been supported not only by Libya, as the Reagan Administration charged, but by Syria as well.\nThe murderous attack on the Pan Am jet in Karachi last September appears to be the work of groups in Lebanon, perhaps aided by Abu Nidal, with a Libyan connection.\n''Terrorists seem to be learning that it is simply harder to fix responsibility if more than one group and country is involved,'' said Mr. Oakley, who was formerly head of the State Department's office of counterterrorism.\nThe perfection of this new kind of untraceable terror was the Istanbul synagogue attack.\n''We can go on forever searching for Abu Nidal,'' said one Israeli official, ''or we can start right now to assign blame where it belongs - on the states that sponsor such actions.'' THE EVIDENCE\nThe massacre at the Neve Shalom Synagogue in Istanbul, some experts believe, is an example of a new kind of cooperative terrorism in which several groups, backed by more than one government, work together. Turkish investigators suspect the involvement of Libya, Syria and Iran. The weapons used in the synagogue were the same type as some of those supplied by Libya to terrorists for an attack on an American officers' club in Ankara in April. A terrorist arrested while attempting to hijack a plane in Karachi recognized one of the two synagogue attackers from a composite sketch as an Arab trained by Abu Nidal in Syrian-controlled Lebanon. And their investigation of the assassination of a Jordanian diplomat has led Turkish police to believe that the Iranian-dominated Islamic Jihad group was also involved in the synagogue killings. WHO IS ABUL NIDAL?\nThere is disagreement over what he looks like, conjecture as to whether he is in charge of his own organization and even rumors that he is no longer alive. But most terrorism experts believe that Abu Nidal does indeed exist.\nYet while his name has become synonymous with terror itself, little is known about this elusive man or the inner workings of his group, the Fatah Revolutuionary Council. It is known that his real name is Sabry al-Banna. There are few photos of him, and some may be fakes. Salah Khalaf, the No. 2 man in the Palestine Liberation Organization, says that Abu Nidal has undergone plastic surgery at least six times to disguise his appearance (photos below).\nHis current whereabouts are in dispute. A British intelligence source says that Abu Nidall was seen last month in Damascus; others say Lybia, still others say he travels most of the time. ''Frankly, we don't know where the hell he is,' said one American diplomat.\nAbu Nidal has reportedly had persistent health problems, aggravated by chain-smoking -- he is said to have smoked as many as four packs of cigarettes a day. In a recently published biography of Abu Nidal, the Israeli journalist Yossi Melman claims that the world's chief terrorist has had at least three heart operations.\nMany in his 300 to 500-member group are Palestinian students. Abu Nidal is said to recruit from his own region those linked to him by family loyalty, a strong bond in Arab circles. Members are reputedly well-paid; should they die during a mission, their families are provided for. There is no leaving the organization -- the only escape is death.\nThe Fatah Revolutionary Council reportedly took root in the mid-1970's in Baghdad, where Abu Nidal was head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office until he broke off from the P.L.O. over Yasir Arafat's moderate policies.\nHis first base was in Baghdad, but Iraq, under pressure from France and the United States, forced him out in the early 1980's. He moved to Damascus, where the group maintains a ''cultural center.'' It has bases in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon, in Lybia and moves freely in East Europe.\nAriel Merari, chief terrorism analyst at Tel Aviv University, says that Abu Nidal's group has become increasingly mercenary, working more to compensate host states for their services than for ideological goals. The group has been impossible to infiltrate, the analyst says, because it operates through small cells isolated from one another.\nSome Western intelligence experts believe that Abu Nidal may not actually run the organization. One Israeli expert believes that the real chief is a Syrian intelligence officer. A French expert suspects that the secret chief is a senior P.L.O. official, who, unbeknownst to Yasir Arafat, has for years been attempting to undermine the P.L.O by secretly directing the most bloodthirsty of the operations attributed to Abu Nidal.\nDespite the group's denials of the synagogue massacre, it has consistently attacked Turkey as a ''fascist junta'' in its weekly magazine, Palestine al-Thawra, published in Arabic in Damascus. The magazine routinely publishes news and communiques of the Kurdish rebels and Armenian terrorists, Turkey's enemies.\nAbu Nidal's spokesman, Atel Abu Bakr, said in a recent interview in the Bekaa Valley that more operations were in store. He threatened Jewish cultural and religious institutions in Europe where Jews, he said, were using synagogues as covers for ''Zionist espionage activities.'' -- J.M.

The odds against its happening like that by chance must be billions to one.'' ''You don't think it was chance?'' ''I think it's one of the great proofs of a divine creator,'' said Persse.\n''Have you ever thought, Angelica,'' said Persse, ''what a remarkable thing it is that the moon and the sun look to our eyes approximately the same size? . . . The odds against its happening like that by chance must be billions to one.'' ''You don't think it was chance?'' ''I think it's one of the great proofs of a divine creator,'' said Persse. ''I think He had an eye for symmetry.'' - David Lodge, ''Small World''\nSure, it's easy to make fun. Our planet flies through space more smoothly than any airplane, covered with water yet never spilling a drop, so it must have had a Designer.\nOur eyes display too complex an architecture to be reached by random mutations, so they must have had a Biological Engineer. New York City offers a brilliantly conceived breeding ground for cockroaches; surely, therefore, we can deduce the existence of a cockroach deity. The so-called argument from design - from design, that is, to the existence of God - had barely been thought up before it was being satirized, and you can't always tell the serious versions from the parodies.\nBut lately, science has been upping the ante. No one cares anymore that the moon is unusually large. Nowadays, we have incredibly well-tuned constants of fundamental physics - to name just one, the gravitational force, which, if put ever-so-slightly out of whack, would have turned the universe into a collection of red dwarf stars or blue giant stars, either way presumably inhospitable to life. When modern cosmologists calculate the odds against life as we know it, they no longer speak of ''billions to one.'' They toss around numbers like 1040, or 10301, or 10 to the 10 to the 30th, a number that cannot even be typeset without either two levels of superscript or a universe full of zeroes.\nFor most of the last millennium, science and faith have been enemies. Science explains. Faith likes the inexplicable. Amid the agnostic throng, few scientists talk openly about belief in God. Even so, as science moves toward its Grand Unified Theory and other grails, some of its practitioners have been seeing an argument for God in the esoterica of high-energy physics. They feel that somewhere in these cosmological coincidences, and in the accumulating perfection of mathematics, lies the evidence of design that cannot be explained away. Perhaps, they feel, science is finally reaching a level of knowledge that will confirm God, instead of rendering Him superfluous.\nThis is the argument that gets its most vigorous airing in John Updike's new novel, ''Roger's Version.'' Though never quite so earnest, never quite so garrulous about it, some practicing scientists really do share at least a part of the feeling of Updike's pallid, pimpled antagonist, a computer scientist named Dale Kohler. ''The most miraculous thing is happening,'' he says. ''The physicists are getting down to the nitty-gritty, they've really just about pared things down to the ultimate details, and the last thing they ever expected to happen is happening. God is showing through.''\nUpdike's version contains its share of parody, to be sure. It also assembles the richest hodgepodge of scientific shop talk to be found anywhere in fiction - absolutely authentic in its slangy allusions to fractals and cellular automata and the Mandelbrot set. Dale Kohler knows his science, and he cannot be laughed at when he says, ''They've been scraping away at physical reality all these centuries, and now the layer of the little left we don't understand is so fine God's face is staring right out at us.'' He just wants to finish the job.\nAbsurd, of course. Yet in the nonfictional world, scientists' writings are letting slip the occasional claim that things may be coming to a head. The physicist Paul Davies: ''Right or wrong, the fact that science has actually advanced to the point where what were formerly religious questions can be seriously tackled, itself indicates the far-reaching consequences of the new physics.'' Another physicist, Alan Lightman: ''Of all people today, I think scientists have the deepest faith in the unseen world. The greater the scientist, the deeper his faith. . . . It's a special brand of faith. You might say that the scientist sees God as a mathematician.''\nMeanwhile, the distinguished journal Nature has lately carried a strange colloquy about miracles. R. J. Berry, a professor of genetics at the University of London and a member of the General Synod of the Church of England, set off much debate with a long commentary on what scientists should believe. Recognize that science has limits, he argued. Evaluate apparent miracles with proper scientific skepticism, but allow for the possibility that ''miracles are a necessary but unpredictable consequence of a God who holds the world in being.''\nThese scientists do not quite contend that science can prove God. To the extent that there is a middle ground, it is expressed by Berry. ''I think there is a certain disenchantment with good old-fashioned humanism slash materialism slash whatever-you-want-to-call-it.'' But when it comes to the argument from design, the problem is that science has a way of finding explanations after all. ''You go and look at a sunset on top of a nice hill, and to me I'm looking at God's handiwork,'' says Berry. ''But I wouldn't want to use it to prove God, because there's always a mechanical explanation.''\nActually, for every scientist putting forward modernized versions of the argument from design, there is another one stripping it of its last claims to respectability. While those with faith stress how inexplicably congenial are the fundamental constants of nature, like the gravitational force, others choose to stress how self-organization emerges spontaneously in complex systems, how chaos gives birth to order, pattern, structure. And evolutionary biologists have come far in explaining how eyes, wings, fingernails and brains all could arise without divine intervention.\nScience does eventually manage to explain -that's the problem. In biology, the explanations often turn out to be less highfalutin than the questions. The mathematician Ronald Graham expresses a sensible understanding of the human brain when he says: ''It didn't really evolve for the purpose of trying to understand the space-time continuum or look at things in a hundred thousand dimensions. It was there to keep you out of the rain and help you figure out where the berries are.'' Only in mathematics itself, really, does the process of discovery always seem to peel away the gauze obscuring something like the work of God. Mathematics is beauty at its rawest.\nBut the question about mathematical beauty is always this: Is it created or discovered? How much is reality and how much human interpretation? ''Most of us feel that it's already there and we're just discovering it,'' says Graham. ''Then the question becomes, where do you draw the line? Was Beethoven discovering the 'Waldstein' Sonata or did he create it?'' A mathematician would answer, half-seriously, that the ideas were already there and the implementation was Beethoven's.\nProof, though, is serious, and nowadays the business of proof has been turned over to mathematicians, except for the part remaining in the hands of trial lawyers. Clerics no longer prove, divinity professors no longer prove, even philosophers are out of the proof game. In the old days, when the argument from design first got around, people argued just as fervently that God must exist because everybody believes in Him, or that God must exist because moral behavior exists. These arguments have faded, mercifully. Most people don't even want a God who can be proved - a fathomable, graspable God, or, as Updike puts it, ''a God Who lets Himself be intellectually trapped.'' Proof leaves no room for faith.\nWhy look to science at all then? I think it may be a matter of turf. God's turf is the unseen, of course, and nowadays the unseen, the mysterious, the inexplicable, the profound - these dark things belong, not to the theologian, but to the scientist.
960	SAM NUNN'S RISING STAR	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D8173EF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: IN MID-DECEMBER, A SHORT MONTH after they had retaken the United States Senate, Democrats were feeling buoyant, perhaps nowhere more so than on an Amtrak train heading from Washington to Williamsburg, Va. The Democratic Leadership Council, a group of younger leaders dedicated to moving their party to the right, had chartered the train to take members, their families and the press corps to a conference at which the council would discuss ideas for regaining the White House.\nIN MID-DECEMBER, A SHORT MONTH after they had retaken the United States Senate, Democrats were feeling buoyant, perhaps nowhere more so than on an Amtrak train heading from Washington to Williamsburg, Va. The Democratic Leadership Council, a group of younger leaders dedicated to moving their party to the right, had chartered the train to take members, their families and the press corps to a conference at which the council would discuss ideas for regaining the White House.\nThe train was chock-a-block with new Democratic stars - Florida Gov. Bob Graham, just elected to the Senate, and former Virginia Gov. Charles S. Robb, frequently mentioned as a 1988 Presidential or Vice-Presidential prospect. And on the first car, so surrounded by party officials and television cameras that he was virtually unable to move, sat Sam Nunn Jr., the senior Senator from Georgia, the Democrats' principal spokesman on defense, an unprepossessing man who had never attracted much national attention.\nUntil now. ''How's it going, Mr. President?'' several well-wishers asked Nunn as they joined the throng. He greeted the queries with a weak smile. Near the end of the three-hour journey, Nunn tried to make his way to the next car, where his wife, Colleen, patiently waited. He never made it. With each step, he was stopped by someone wanting to know if he intended to run for President. The Senator gave the same humorless, verbatim response each time: ''I'm not leaning toward it, but I will make a decision by the end of January.''\nLater, at the conference, Nunn opened his speech on defense policy with a bit of deadpan: ''I've been asked to demonstrate some charisma, by talking about throw-weight, hardened silos, megatonnage and MIRV's.'' His remark drew laughter, but it also teased a question that many Democrats are asking: Is Sam Nunn too smart, too conservative and too dull to be President?\nThe more intriguing question may be whether Nunn, a man who has come reluctantly to political prominence in recent months, really wants to be President.\nNunn, who is about to realize his ambition of becoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, long has been recognized as his party's leader on national security. The 48-year-old lawyer has left his mark on almost every major military and foreign-policy issue of 1986. Recently, as President Reagan has struggled with the controversy over the Iran-contra arms sale scandal, Nunn has been widely acclaimed for his role in leading his party's early response.\nIt was Nunn, in an interview following the President's first news conference after the controversy broke, who advised the President to empanel a group of ''wise men'' to review the policy-making process inside the White House; Mr. Reagan accepted the advice a few days later. And it was the Senator from Georgia who, in perfect political pitch, cautioned Democrats to avoid the temptation to exploit the situation politically. ''He's certainly the clear winner in what could turn out to be a national tragedy,'' said Ann F. Lewis, national director of Americans for Democratic Action, the liberal policy group. ''If Sam Nunn didn't exist today, we'd have to invent him - a Southerner who rises above politics in times of crisis.'' But, added Ms. Lewis, ''the ability to rise above politics that makes him so effective could hamper him as a Presidential candidate.''\nNEITHER A STRIKING PRESENCE nor an inspiring speaker, the bespectacled lawmaker combs his thinning brown hair over a bald spot and speaks in a flat drawl. He has never employed a Washington campaign consultant to advise him on his image or on issues. And his voting record - he is one of President Reagan's strongest Democratic supporters in the Senate - is disconcerting to many Democrats.\nFor most Presidential aspirants, these handicaps could be insurmountable. But in Nunn's case, they have only added to the growing curiosity. And his leadership on national defense and his tough anti-Soviet foreign policy have effectively thrust him into the public eye.\nIn a two-week period between the November elections and the eruption of the controversy over the Iran arms sale and the diversion of money to the Nicaraguan contras, Nunn was swamped with almost 100 interview requests - an extraordinary number for a Senator.\nThe press interest forced Nunn to do something he has rarely done in his 13-year Senate career: hold a Washington news conference. When he strode into the crowded conference room in the Capitol, several reporters began humming ''Hail to the Chief,'' musical fanfare that has officially graced the entrances of only one Georgian, Jimmy Carter.\nThere are important differences between the Senator and the former President, of course. Jimmy Carter was an outsider, but Sam Nunn is a consummate political insider who has cultivated close personal relationships with members of the Washington establishment. (On weekends, Nunn, one of the Senate's best golfers, can usually be found in the company of Washington powerbrokers on the Congressional Country Club links.) But there are also similarities. Both Carter and Nunn are technocrats, masters of complex detail. Many political insiders wonder whether Nunn, like Carter, will founder on the shoals of detail. Indeed, Nunn has yet to demonstrate the capacity to inspire and move voters by articulating broad themes of national purpose. A serious man, Nunn refuses to seek political advantage where others rush in.\nFor example, when his press secretary asked Nunn - a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee who has spent much of his time recently in closed hearings on the Iran arms affair - whether Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, the former White House national security adviser, had invoked the Fifth Amendment before the committee, Nunn told his aide: ''I can't discuss what happened in the committee.''\nYet there is a folksier aspect to Sam Nunn's personality. Several months ago, during a trip to rural Georgia, Nunn told a gathering of local farmers about the ''big-city politician who visits a farm and accidentally steps in manure.'' The politician, recounted Nunn, ''looked down at his feet and cried, 'Oh my God, I'm melting!' '' SAM NUNN IS A MAN OF CONTRADICTIONS. HIS politics and Senate career have been marked by extreme caution and deference. He goes out of his way to avoid confrontations and to compromise on controversial issues.\nBut at his big, rambling split-level house in Bethesda, Md., he displays the fiercely competitive side of his nature that friends and family have known for years.\nRecently, a reporter and a photographer from The Atlanta Constitution convinced Nunn to engage his 17-year-old son, Brian, in a game of backyard basketball. Soon, the Senator's incessant chatter rattled the boy, forcing him to miss a one-handed shot, and Nunn aggressively grabbed the rebound. Reviewing the scene, the reporter, Hal Straus, wrote: ''The impromptu basketball game had started as a setup for a photo session. Like almost everything Sam Nunn is involved in, though, it had quickly become serious.'' Nunn is so serious, in fact, that when playing Trivial Pursuit with his 20-year-old daughter, Michelle, he has even been known to question the answers on the game cards.\nA classic overachiever, even in high school Nunn was showing the residents of Perry, a small town of 10,000 in central Georgia, the qualities that would drive his political career. He was a superior Eagle Scout, an honor student and captain of his high-school basketball team, leading it to a state championship despite his weak legs. ''For two years,'' he recalled, ''my mother would wrap my ankles every day for basketball practice.''\nNunn's family was part of Perry's social and political aristocracy. Sam Nunn Sr., a formal man with a passion for reading, who died in 1965, was a lawyer, a farmer, a one-time mayor of Perry and a top officer in the town's major savings and loan institution.\nAs a boy, Sam Jr. would sit enraptured while his father discussed politics with some of Georgia's political barons, men such as Representative Carl Vinson, Nunn's great uncle and a lawmaker who amassed enormous power in his 51 years in the House, much of that time as chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\nAfter studying at Georgia Tech, Nunn earned a law degree from Emory University, then served stints in the Coast Guard and on the staff of Vinson's House Armed Services Committee in Washington. In 1964, he returned to Perry to pursue a political career; four years later, he was elected to the Georgia legislature.\nIn 1972, at age 33 and with his statewide name recognition at only 2 percent, Nunn embarked on a long-shot campaign to win the United States Senate seat vacated by the death of Richard B. Russell. He won the Democratic primary, and then faced Fletcher S. Thompson, a conservative Republican, who plastered the state with posters linking Nunn to Senator George McGovern, the liberal Democratic Presidential nominee that year.\nTo appeal to rural white voters, Nunn flew to Montgomery, Ala., to receive the endorsement of Gov. George C. Wallace, the most prominent symbol of the South's resistance to racial desegregation. ''George Wallace represents the real views of Georgians,'' Nunn said in Montgomery, echoing Wallace's attacks on ''judicial tyranny'' and court-ordered school busing.\nBefore election day, Nunn traveled to Washington to lay claim to a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, a panel once headed by Russell and a source of political strength in Georgia, where the economy depends heavily on military installations and defense contractors.\nCarl Vinson, by then retired from the Congress, introduced his nephew to some of the most powerful men in the Senate, including Henry M. Jackson of Washington State and John C. Stennis of Mississippi, who later would become Nunn's mentors. They were impressed by the young candidate's eagerness to join Armed Services at a time when the Vietnam War had made the military an unpopular institution. Nunn returned to Georgia with a promise of a seat on the committee, and used the informal commitment to his advantage in the final stages of the campaign. He won the election with 54 percent of the vote. NUNN'S VICTORY BELIED the long-shot odds political pundits had placed on him, primarily because of his sober mien and nearly complete lack of charisma.\nTo make himself look more appealing to voters in 1972, ''I was told I had to get rid of my black horn-rimmed glasses,'' Nunn recalled. ''After a day of wearing wire-rimmed glasses, I had a headache and they just about ruined my nose. I said I'll either get elected with my comfortable glasses or I'll be defeated with them.''\nHis style since coming to Washington has remained aggressively staid. At the end of his 10- to 12-hour days, he usually heads home to be with his family. He rarely attends cocktail parties or luncheons with lobbyists, and until last year he resisted becoming a national figure. ''I don't know of anyone up here who has less ego or cares less about publicity,'' said one Democratic Senator.\nIn 1982, Nunn was the first choice of Senate Democratic leaders to give the party's views on national defense in response to President Reagan's State of the Union address. ''Most Democratic Senators were fighting to get a piece'' of the prime-time television exposure, said Greg Schneiders, currently a Democratic consultant who at that time was an aide to Robert C. Byrd, the Senate Democratic leader.\n''I told Nunn he'd have twominutes for his part,'' recalled Schneiders. ''He called back at the end of the day and said he couldn't do it. Two minutes was not enough time to address a complex issue like national defense, and we should get someone else to speak.''\nHis seriousness of purpose and mastery of detail have gained for Nunn great influence in the Senate. Last fall, when Congress was engulfed in the political frenzy over illegal drugs, the Senate took up a proposal to use military aircraft in the war on narcotics. Nunn rose to speak.\n''To seal the borders to drug smugglers,'' he said quietly, ''will require 80 new military bases, 800 helicopters, 7,400 military police and three times the number of Awacs reconaissance planes currently flying.\n''I can go on,'' continued Nunn, ''but it gets worse.'' His colleagues gave in - some of them even began to wave handkerchiefs in surrender. The measure was tabled. He has also been a key figure in the debate over the MX missile. Although he has criticized the Administration's plan to base MX missiles in hardened Minuteman silos, Nunn has been a part of every major compromise that has kept the MX alive, and he was instrumental in getting the number of MX's reduced from 60 to 50.\nNunn's seriousness about issues is matched by his near-legendary political caution. When fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter ran for President in 1976, Nunn withheld his endorsement until after the Pennsylvania primary, when Carter already had a lock on the nomination. And in 1984, Senator John Glenn of Ohio came to the South to make his last stand in the contest for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Glenn was running as a centrist, and he desperately sought Nunn's imprimatur. The two men appeared together at a rally, at which Nunn lavished praise on the former astronaut. But he withheld his endorsement, refusing, under prodding from reporters, even to say whom he planned to vote for in the Georgia primary. BUT NUNN APPEARS TO be taking the first halting steps toward political activism. President Reagan's landslide re-election victory over Walter F. Mondale in 1984 provided centrists with an opportunity to take charge of their party's political debate. Nunn has played a lead-ing role in that effort, helping in 1985 to establish the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that includes such other potential Presidential aspirants as Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt and former Governor Robb of Virginia.\nNunn insists that the creation of the council was motivated less by ideology than by the need for the Democratic Party to come up with an agenda for winning the White House. ''Democrats have to show they can govern,'' he said. The council will demonstrate the party's ability by focusing on strategies for economic growth. ''Defense and foreign policy will be a measure of our competence,'' he said. ''But we will regain peoples' confidence by how we handle the economy.''\nAt the same time he is working to reshape his party from within, Nunn is also exerting his influence over the Reagan Administration, to the Democrats' advantage. Shortly after returning from his October summit meeting in Iceland with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President Reagan went on the road for Republican candidates, bashing the Democratic Party as a threat to his Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, program, and demanding that Democrats declare where they stood on defending America.\nA Democratic strategist called Nunn and urged him to lead a counterattack. The Senator demurred. ''Nunn said it was too important an issue for Democrats to try to take political advantage of,'' the strategist recalled.\nBut the next day, Nunn delivered a speech on the Senate floor that threw the President on the political defensive on arms control and sharpened the debate over the Reykjavik meeting with Gorbachev. He became the first member of Congress with substantial standing to question whether Reagan understood the implications of the proposals he put on the table in Iceland, particularly the offer to eliminate all strategic nuclear missiles and ballistic missiles from Europe.\n''It is obvious that this proposal has not been thought through adequately,'' Nunn later told reporters. ''If a liberal Democrat had proposed such an agreement, the impeachment petitions would already be circulating.''\nNunn says that the impression of him as a reluctant partisan stems largely from hisrefusal to politicize national-security issues. ''I can't think of any major problem that can be solved with partisanship,'' he said. His break with the President on arms control, he says, was based on policy, not politics.\nThe most significant change in Sam Nunn has been his willingness to campaign on behalf of fellow Democrats. One of those who benefited from his political coattails in 1986 was Representative Wyche Fowler Jr., a liberal from Atlanta, who defeated Senator Mack Mattingly, a Republican, at least partly on the strength of Nunn's endorsement and active campaigning. It was the first time Nunn, a man once known as Selfish Sam for his reluctance to involve himself in other campaigns, had put his prestige on the line for another Georgia Democrat.\nNunn also campaigned actively on behalf of other Democratic candidates across the country, including the liberal California Senator Alan Cranston and Colorado Representative Timothy E. Wirth, who won Gary Hart's vacant Senate seat. Wirth credits Nunn with protecting him against his opponent's attempt to make Star Wars an issue in that race.\nWhy has Nunn suddenly taken a role in national Democratic politics? ''People have said I did this because I was running for President,'' he said. ''The truth of it is, this is really the first time anybody invited me to their states to campaign.'' BUT NUNN'S INTEREST IN the Presidency has clearly motivated his shift away from caution. Nunn declared last summer that he would consider a Presidential race; at the time, his statement stirred little interest. But when the November elections were over and Democrats again controlled the Senate, Nunn was suddenly being taken seriously as a prospect for the White House.\n''In voting for a President, people tend to react to the last President,'' said Hamilton Jordan, who served as President Jimmy Carter's chief of staff and main political strategist. ''After Ronald Reagan's 'chairman of the board' approach to the Presidency, I think the American people will hunger in 1988 for a hands-on chief executive with proven Federal experience and the ability to tackle the tough issues of arms control, budget and trade.'' Sam Nunn, predicts Jordan, ''will (Continued on Page 31) fit both the mood and the need of our country.''\nNunn, who has not formed a campaign committee, begun fund-raising efforts or sought expert advice for a Presidential run, has promised his supporters a decision by the end of this month on whether he will form a Presidential exploratory committee.\n''A key question is whether I could make a greater contribution to Georgia and the nation as chairman of the Armed Services Committee or as President,'' he said.\nHis admirers are telling him he is in the enviable position of having the Presidency seek him, and that 1988 is his year. Eight Southern states, including Georgia, are scheduled to hold primaries on March 8, and some political strategists say that if Nunn survives the New Hampshire primary, a Southern sweep could catapult him to the front of the pack.\nSome political professionals question whether Nunn would be able to recreate the coalition of Southern whites and blacks that came together behind Jimmy Carter's Presidential bid in 1976. Nunn, for instance, does not apologize for his early support for George Wallace.\n''I frankly admired Wallace,'' he said, ''not because of his racial views, but because of his willingness to stand up and shake a fist at Washington occasionally. There's something therapeutic about that in the South.''\nMoreover, one of the 1988 contestants is likely to be the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a sharp critic of the effort by Nunn and other Democrats to yank the party to the right.\nBut there are indications that the growing political pragmatism of Southern blacks could work in Nunn's favor, even against the emotional appeal of a Jackson candidacy.\nDespite his 1972 embrace of Wallace, Nunn has been spared the taint of intransigence on civil rights that marked an earlier generation of Southern politicians. Although not a vocal opponentof segregation, Nunn, as a young lawyer in the 1960's, did help to organize a biracial committee to open lines of communication between blacks and whites in Perry, his hometown.\nNunn has built a close political relationship with his state's black leaders, many of whom are trying to persuade the Senator to run for President. Among them are former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson, who supported Jesse Jackson in 1984, and John Lewis, a veteran civil rights activist elected last November to Congress from Atlanta's Fifth District.\n''Southern politicians have a way of growing and broadening themselves when they reach the national political scene,'' said Lewis. ''I think Sam Nunn is trying to broaden his concerns and base, and if he runs for President, I'll be out there working for him.'' FOR ALL THE PRESIDEN-tial talk, Sam Nunn embodies a political irony: few Democrats are more respected and at the same time seemingly more out of step with their party. Although he has criticized President Reagan severely on arms control, Nunn is one of his strongest supporters among Senate Democrats. According to Congressional Quarterly, in 1985 Nunn voted with the President on contested issues more than any other Democrat; and he tied Alabama's Senator Howell Heflin as the Democrat who voted conservative most often.\nOn defense, Nunn opposed the effort of 49 of his Senate colleagues to cut $2 billion from Reagan's budget request for Star Wars, although he repeatedly criticized the President for trying to sell it as a ''population shield,'' a notion that the Senator says ''borders on the absurd.''\nNunn also continues to support Reagan's effort to aid Nicaraguan rebels, and was instrumental in forging Congressional approval last spring of the $100 million aid package to the contras. Even now, after the disclosure that profits from the secret arms sale to Iran had been diverted to the contras, Nunn has not shifted his position.\n''Our strategic interest in Nicaragua hasn't changed,'' he explained. ''I hope we will find a way to debate the issue on its merits.'' Still, on the contra-aid issue he remains cautious, refusing to say whether he will take the lead on it in the Senate in 1987. ''It will depend on what the Administration does,'' he said.\nSome liberal Democrats contend that Nunn could quickly and dramatically broaden his political base by using his influence to oppose Reagan on these issues. Nunn dismisses the criticism. ''I've never dealt with national defense in a political way and I'm not about to start now,'' he said. ''My critics do me a favor by exaggerating my influence and then knocking me down for not exercising it.''\nThe fact that he is even answering his critics, rather than going quietly about the business of building influence, marks a change in Sam Nunn. But if he embarks on a national campaign, Nunn will be tested as he never has been before. Will he remain the reluctant politician, or will he aggressively seek the mantle of national leadership? ''If I decide to run,'' Sam Nunn said recently, ''there will be no question that I will have fire in the belly.''
961	Identified Flying Object	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D8173EF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: ARE YOU BORED WITH your usual wines? The same old Lafite, Echezeaux and Dom Perignon, week in, week out? Perhaps it's time for a little flying cigar.\nARE YOU BORED WITH your usual wines? The same old Lafite, Echezeaux and Dom Perignon, week in, week out? Perhaps it's time for a little flying cigar.\nYes, flying cigar. It's a wine - but why hear it secondhand? Let Randall Grahm tell it: He's the chap who made the stuff, and what follows are the notes from the back label, which he wrote: ''In 1954, the village council of Chateauneuf-du-Pape was quite perturbed and apprehensive that flying saucers or 'flying cigars' might do damage to their vineyards, were they to land therein. So, right-thinking men all, they passed an ordinance prohibiting the landing of flying saucers or flying cigars in their vineyards. (This ordinance has worked well in discouraging such landings.) The ordinance further states that any flying saucers or flying cigars that did land were to be taken immediately to the pound.''\nThe French for flying cigar is cigare volante, and that's what Mr. Grahm calls his wine.\nA bit fey? Perhaps. But not entirely irrevelant. Chateauneuf-du-Pape is probably the best-known wine of France's Rhone Valley, and Mr. Grahm has sought to emulate it in his Cigare Volant. He is the owner and wine maker at Bonny Doon Vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains, south of San Francisco.\nMr. Grahm, like many California winegrowers before him, discovered early on that the California wine country isn't really like Bordeaux. On a lot of summer days, even in the so-called cooler northern counties, the temperature is more reminiscent of El Alamein than St.-Emilion.\nWhat much of the California vineyard country resembles is the southern Rhone Valley. The Rhone River rises in the Alps and wanders more or less aimlessly through Switzerland and eastern France until it gets its act together east of Lyons, joins up with the Saone River and heads south 190 miles to the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe northern Rhone region, from Lyons to Valence, is temperate, but from Montelimar to Avignon the country is meridional - hot and dusty, with red tile roofs everywhere. This is the country of Chateauneuf-du-Pape, of Cotes du Rhone and Gigondas, a land where the syrah grape is king and where a lot of Californian wine makers could feel at home. Particularly those who make petite sirah. Before Randall Grahm, dark, heavy petite sirah was California's most Rhone-like wine. Actually, the syrah and the petite sirah are not the same grape. The California petite sirah grape is known in the Rhone Valley as the durif.\nCigare Volante is made from 72 percent grenache, 25 percent syrah and 3 percent mourvedre, the traditional melange used in Chateauneuf-du-Pape.\nGrenache, which shows up all around the Mediterranean basin, has been used in California for years, mostly in rose wines. Mourvedre, originally a Spanish grape, is grown in a few vineyards around Concord in Contra Costa County in California.\nMr. Grahm first went to Santa Cruz to make pinot noir, the wine of Burgundy. His 48-acre property at Bonny Doon turned out to be too hot. Which didn't stop him from making pinot noir. He buys the grapes each year in Oregon.\nHe makes Bordeaux-style claret and Burgundy-style chardonnay, but, more and more, he has moved to the Rhone-style wines. His young vineyards -planted in 1980 - contain plots of marsanne, roussanne and viognier, the grape of France's most exotic little wine region, Chateau Grillet. Marsanne is the grape of Hermitage white, and Mr. Grahm predicts that, 15 years from now, marsanne will be among the principal white wines of California.\nOne of his favorite grapes is pinot blanc. Actually, it isn't pinot blanc at all, but melon, a popular grape in the Loire Valley.\nWhile his own vines are maturing, Mr. Grahm purchases most of his grapes. His syrah, for example, comes from French vines grown around Paso Robles, in central California.\nThe Bonny Doon vineyards are as unusual as the wines they are beginning to produce. As in some regions of France, the vines are planted close together and not irrigated. ''The vines compete with each other,'' Mr. Grahm says. ''It forces them to produce their best. Typically, the best vineyards in Napa produce about six tons of grapes per acre; the best vineyards in Chateauneuf produce two. Is it any wonder that so many of our grapes, and therefore our wines, lack acid and flavor?''\nBonny Doon produced about 8,000 cases of wine in 1985, and may go to around 10,000 this year. Not very much. And since Mr. Grahm makes so many different kinds of wine, there are very few cases of any one type. The current list includes Cigare Volante; syrah; a red blend called Claret; a muscat canelli, a dessert wine made from grapes left out to dry before fermentation; a cabernet sauvignon made from grapes grown in Mendocino's Anderson Valley; a pinot blanc; a vin gris made from mourvedre, and a controversial high-acid chardonnay that last year sold out at the winery. Bonny Doon wines are distributed only in about 10 states, but several shops around New York stock a few cases when they can get them.\nMr. Grahm, 33, is a city person -Los Angeles - who gave up philosophy for wine. ''Actually, I was supposed to become a doctor,'' he says. ''Instead, I became an alchemist, which is what a wine maker really is.'' He didn't give up philosophy completely. One of his 1985 efforts is a white table wine called Le Sophiste -Cuvee Philosophique. It's a blend of marsanne and roussanne. ''I really haven't thought out the name yet,'' says Mr. Grahm, the former philosphy student, ''except that a lot of thought went into making the wine.'' WINE
962	The Homecoming	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED8173EF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: RESTAURANTS THAT SERVE so-called back-to-basics fare - some call it mom-and-pop food - are proliferating, offering such specialties as chicken pot pie, corned beef and cabbage, pot roast with potato pancakes, braised short ribs of beef and meat loaf with mashed potatoes.\nRESTAURANTS THAT SERVE so-called back-to-basics fare - some call it mom-and-pop food - are proliferating, offering such specialties as chicken pot pie, corned beef and cabbage, pot roast with potato pancakes, braised short ribs of beef and meat loaf with mashed potatoes.\nI do not consider this a retrogression in taste. To my mind, it signifies a healthy sophistication. We have adopted and learned to accept the kitchen cultures of many nations and regions, just as we have learned to accept and applaud American cooking with self-assurance.\nAn interesting point is that today's young chefs are not only turning out these long-established staples, but are adding their own touches to them. During a recent visit to California, I was able to talk with two of the most widely acclaimed young chefs who offer their clients superlative food with a purely Yankee heritage. They are John E. Sola of the Grill, in Beverly Hills, and Leonard Schwartz of the 72 Market Street restaurant, in Venice, about a 35-minute drive from downtown Los Angeles.\nThe dishes that chef Sola produced during my visit included a fabled chicken pot pie; chef Schwartz's offerings included an uncommonly well-seasoned black bean soup with a flavoring of ground cumin.\nThese are dishes with well-established roots, but in these young men's hands, they are not at all like mother used to make. The pies were crowned with puff pastry that puffed and billowed and browned as they baked. The black bean soup was served with side dishes of sour cream and freshly made salsa, that great Tex-Mex specialty consisting of tomatoes, onions, jalapeno peppers and fresh coriander leaves. These are garnishes to be added to the soup according to taste. Jalapeno corn-bread muffins, another accompaniment, was made with corn and cheese.\n''This return to the basics is, for most Americans, a question of sentiment and nostalgia,'' says Schwartz, who was born in the Bronx 38 years ago. ''But I, personally, look on it as an adventure. I can't cook without the desire to improve on the original, on what mother used to make. I think of the food of today's young chefs as 'reborn dishes.' I always want to sharpen flavors and texture with herbs and spices not known to earlier generations. I guess you'd call it bringing things up-to-date.''\nChef Sola, who was born in Boston 33 years ago and who moved to Southern California at the age of 3 months, believes this resurgence of home-style cooking reflects a desire on the part of the public to recapture the simpler values in life. ''People yearn for the good old flavors,'' he says. ''They like larger portions and they enjoy the simplicity of it all. They don't want fancy sauces to cover up natural flavors. We like to give customers anything they ask for, whether it's ground sirloin with mushroom sauce or braised short ribs. Ours is an operation with food that appeals to the whole family - mothers, fathers, the children, aunts and uncles.'' CHICKEN POT PIE 4 1/2 pounds chicken legs and thighs 3 pounds bony parts of chicken, such as the backs and necks 1 leek, about 3 ounces, trimmed and rinsed well 2 bay leaves 3 cups finely chopped onions 2 cups coarsely chopped celery 1 cup heavy cream 14 tablespoons butter 6 tablespoons flour\n1/4 teaspoon bottled hot sauce 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice\nSalt to taste, if desired\n1/4 cup finely chopped shallots 2 cups diced carrots\n3/4 pound fresh small mushrooms, cut into quarters, about 4 cups\n1/2 pound fresh or frozen green peas, about 1Y cups 1 1/2 pounds puff pastry (see note) 3 eggs, beaten.\n1. Put the chicken legs and thighs plus the bony parts of chicken in a kettle and add cold water to cover. Bring to the boil and let simmer about one minute. Drain.\n#2.Put 16 cups of water in a clean kettle and add the chicken pieces. Add the leek, bay leaves, two cups of the chopped onions and the celery. Cover and cook, skimming the surface often, to remove excess fat, foam and scum, about 15 minutes.\n#3.Using a pair of tongs, remove the legs and thighs from the kettle. Let cool. Meanwhile, let the stock with the necks and backs continue to cook, skimming the surface as necessary.\n#4.When the legs and thighs are cool enough to handle, remove and set aside the meat from the bones. Discard the skin. There should be about six cups of chicken meat. Toss the bones back into the kettle and cook one hour longer.\n#5.Strain the broth, discarding the solids. Put three cups of the broth into a saucepan, saving the remaining broth for other uses. Add the cream to the broth and bring to the boil. Cook 10 or 15 minutes or until reduced to three and one-half cups.\n#6.Meanwhile, slowly melt eight tablespoons of butter over gentle heat. Skim off the surface foam and carefully pour the clear center liquid into a cup. This is clarified butter. There should be about six tablespoons of the clarified butter. Pour this into a mixing bowl and add the flour. Stir to blend. Bring broth with the cream to the boil. Gradually add the blended flour and butter, stirring constantly with a wire whisk. Add the bottled hot sauce, lemon juice and salt to taste. Cook five minutes.\n#7.Heat the remaining six tablespoons of butter in a wide, heavy skillet and add the shallots. Cook briefly, stirring. Add the remaining cup of onions, the carrots and the mushrooms and cook three minutes, stirring. Add the six cups of chicken meat. Cook, stirring occasionally, about three minutes.\n#8.If fresh peas are used, drop them into boiling water and cook 30 seconds. Drain. If frozen peas are used, put them into a sieve and hold them under the hot water faucet about 15 seconds. Drain. Add the thickened sauce to the chicken and mushroom mixture. Stir in the peas. Blend thoroughly.\n#9.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.\n#10.Ideally, you should use six oven-proof earthenware pot-pie dishes measuring about five and one-half inches in diameter. Spoon equal portions of the creamed chicken into the dishes, piling each portion up slightly.\n#11.Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to an eighth-inch thickness. Using a round lid measuring about six and one-half inches in diameter, cut out six rounds to cover the tops of the pot-pie dishes.\n#12.Brush around the perimeter of each round of pastry with beaten egg to make a one-inch egg-brushed margin. Brush around the outside top of each pot-pie dish about one-inch deep with beaten egg. Invert one egg-brushed round of dough over each filled pot-pie dish. Let the dough drape down all around the sides of each dish. Press the edges of the pastry against the upper side of each dish to seal firmly. Brush the top and sides of the pastry covers with more egg.\n#13.Arrange the dishes on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake about 25 minutes or until the pastry topping is puffed and nicely browned.\nYield:Six servings.\nNote:If you do not wish to make your own puff pastry, it may be purchased at Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas, and Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue. BLACK BEAN SOUP\n1/2 pound smoked slab bacon with rind 1 1/2 cups finely chopped onions 1 1/2 cups finely chopped celery 1 1/2 cups finely diced carrots 1 bay leaf 1 tablespoon finely minced garlic 1 1/4 teaspoons dried thyme 4 tablespoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/4 cup finely chopped fresh oregano leaves or 1 tablespoon dried oregano, crumbled 3 tablespoons tomato paste 16 cups rich chicken broth, preferably homemade and concentrated, or canned broth may be substituted 1 pound black turtle beans or other black beans, about 3 cups 6 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\nSalt to taste, if desired\n1/2 cup finely chopped fresh coriander leaves\nSalsa for garnish (see recipe)\nSour cream for garnish\nJalapeno corn-bread muffins, optional (see recipe).\n1.This soup is preferably made at least one day in advance.\n2.Slice off and reserve the rind of the bacon. Cut the bacon into quarter-inch cubes. There should be about one and one-half cups.\n3.Put the bacon cubes and the rind into a heavy kettle or casserole and cook, stirring often, until rendered of fat. When ready, the bacon cubes should be well-browned and crisp.\n4.Add the onions, celery, carrots, bay leaf, garlic, thyme, three tablespoons of the cumin, black pepper and oregano. Stir to blend and cover the kettle or casserole closely. Cook about five minutes over moderately low heat. Do not allow the mixture to burn.\n5. Add the tomato paste and stir briefly. Add the chicken broth and bring to the boil.\n6. Rinse and drain the beans and add them to the soup. Cook, uncovered, over relatively high heat about two and one-half hours, skimming the surface occasionally to remove foam, scum and fat as it rises to the top. The soup is ready when the beans are soft and some of them have disintegrated because of the cooking heat and stirring.\n7. Stir in the lime juice, cayenne pepper, salt, coriander leaves and remaining cumin. Remove and discard the bacon rind and bay leaf.\n8. Ladle the soup into individual soup bowls. Serve the salsa and sour cream on the side, to be added at will. This soup is best served with jalapeno corn-bread muffins as an accompaniment. Yield: Eight to 12 servings. SALSA\n1/2 cup finely chopped white or Spanish onions 2 cups unpeeled, unseeded, cored tomato cut into 1/4-inch cubes 1 1/2 teaspoons or more finely chopped fresh, seeded jalapeno peppers\nSalt to taste, if desired\n1/4 cup finely chopped fresh coriander leaves 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice.\nCombine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and blend well. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Yield: About two and one-half cups. MEAT LOAF 3 tablespoons butter\n3/4 cup finely chopped onions\n3/4 cup finely chopped green onions or scallions\n1/2 cup finely chopped carrots\n1/4 cup finely chopped celery\n1/4 cup finely minced sweet red pepper\n1/4 cup finely minced sweet green pepper 2 teaspoons finely minced garlic\nSalt to taste, if desired 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1/2 teaspoon white pepper 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 3 eggs, well beaten\n1/2 cup bottled ketchup\n1/2 cup half-and-half 2 pounds lean ground chuck\n3/4 pound sausage in bulk (do not use fennel-flavored Italian sausage)\n3/4 pound fine, fresh, toasted bread crumbs\n1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.\n2. Heat the butter in a heavy kettle and add the onions, green onions or scallions, carrots, celery, red and green peppers and garlic. Cook, stirring often, about 10 minutes, or until all the moisture from the vegetables has evaporated. Let stand until cool. Refrigerate until chilled.\n3. In a mixing bowl, combine the salt, black pepper, cayenne, white pepper, cumin, nutmeg and eggs. Beat well and add the ketchup and half-and-half. Blend thoroughly.\n4. Add the chuck, sausage and bread crumbs.\n5. Add the chilled ingredients and mix thoroughly with the hands. Knead for a considerable period of time.\n6. Select a baking dish that will fit neatly and compactly inside a slightly larger baking dish. Pour boiling water into the larger pan and bring the water to the boil.\n7. To shape the meat loaf, dampen the fingers and palms of the hands. Put the meat mixture into the smaller pan and shape it into an oval-shaped loaf resembling a long loaf of bread and measuring approximately 17 by 4 1/2 by 1 1/2 inches.\n8. Set the smaller pan inside the larger pan over the boiling water. Place in the oven and bake 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the water bath. Let the meat loaf rest outside the oven for 20 minutes before slicing and serving. Serve sliced. Yield: Eight to twelve servings.

I hadn't planned to turn in my\nGeneral Electric ID card that early, and I didn't do it willingly.\nMy job was abolished, an increasingly commonplace occurrence today as chief executive officers seek profits by reducing overhead rather than by increasing sales.\nGiven a choice of regular severance pay, a greatly reduced early-retirement package, or the option of staying unemployed and receiving half pay until I could retire at age 60, I chose the latter.\nHow does a man in his prime, with a wife, three daughters and a granddaughter living at home walk away from the 8-to-5 world of executive privilege and take a 50 percent pay cut?\nNot easily and not without a lot of soul-searching, I assure you.\nThe conventional wisdom is that a displaced executive must, as quickly as possible, find a comparable job. Better still, he should start his own company, so he can trumpet to the world that he's now making more money than he ever did working for the corporation.\nOur society glorifies men who cling relentlessly to a career until 65 or 70, especially if, in the process, they create a dragon's hoard of wealth. No matter that it is never to be enjoyed but only passed on to misunderstood children, unknown relatives and the I.R.S.\nAfter 25 or 30 years, work becomes an addiction like cigarette smoking, and one that is equally hard to break. Most American men have by now forgotten the reason they chose their line of work in the first place, and they continue at the job long after it is no longer needed and provides no satisfaction. It took me many introspective weeks to remember that when I first took a corporation job I vowed to make enough money so that I could stop when relatively young and still healthy. Then I would have the time and freedom to do what I wanted.\nInitially, when I got word that I and my staff were goners, I was devastated. I never conceived that a highly respected institution like the General Electric News Bureau, where I was manager of the high-tech unit, could be dispensed with so casually. We specialized in executive articles, speeches and technical stories on hot topics, such as lasers, robots and medical scanners. Even as I had watched individuals and entire organizations fall victim to the G.E. philosophy that ''less is more,'' I foolishly rationalized that it couldn't happen to us. I think what frosted me most was that I had put in 30 years, 5 months and 25 days of continuous service to get to the point that I had 6 weeks' vacation and, finally, the income to be able to take advantage of it. Now I was seemingly back to square one - not because of poor per-formance, but because an unnamed ''they'' were filling a quota from the C.E.O.\nFinding another job is not easy when you are past 50 and dead set against commuting to New York City. But I found one. It would have required moving from Connecticut to New Jersey. We had always been gypsies with G.E., but I couldn't see packing up the family now. I turned the job down.\nI explored setting up a public relations firm with two of my staff. I looked at overpriced office space, talked to enthusiastic, but poor, prospective clients and had meetings with advertising agencies looking for a back-scratching relationship. I didn't like the numbers. I rebelled at the thought of the long hours it would take to make a go of it. And my heart wasn't in it; I couldn't see myself spending another 10 years as a flack, making silk purses from sows' ears.\nIf I knew what I didn't want to do, did I know what I really wanted?\nYes, that was easy. I wanted to write. As a college senior, I had dreamed of working for The New Yorker. Marriage, G.E., the Army and children all deflected me from that dream. But the idea of being a ''real'' writer - not just a corporate ''ghost'' - had rarely been out of my thoughts.\nI wanted to do what was right for my family, but also what was right for me. Wasn't this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try for the dream? Despite the blow to my executive pride, I was far more fortunate than most men who are laid off. G.E.'s half pay would be free of deductions, except for Federal income tax, and it could be supplemented by taking the dividends on our modest portfolio of stocks and bonds in cash instead of reinvesting them. Then, too, my wife was expanding her hobby of cake baking and decorating, and that would help. Even if I never wrote the Great American Novel, I thought we could manage. I told my worried mother what I figured my new take-home pay would be. She said, ''Well, if you can't live on that, you should be spanked.''\nA week before Christmas, two weeks before my final termination, I made up my mind to exit the rat race. I told my family that we'd have to scale back our free-spending style, but that no one was going to have to forgo college or even cable television. My wife was delighted at the prospect of having me around the house, although she pointedly reminded me that marriage was ''for better or worse, but not for lunch.'' The kids simply assumed I had the finances worked out. My earthshaking decision was a ho-hummer.\nAfter 10 months, it seems to be working. I've finished 24 chapters of a book, and for the first time in my adult life I'm able, pretty much, to do all the things I've always wanted to do but never had the time for. Like taking my wife out for breakfast. Reading books I bought 10 years ago. Painting the house. Gardening. Fishing. Dreaming.\nAnd we're still solvent. I've found that double coupons can cut the grocery bill 25 percent. I haunt tag sales and factory outlets for bargains. Because dentists are no longer covered, we go less frequently and brush more. Travel is planned well in advance, to take advantage of $59 hotel rooms and $99 air fares. And we subscribe to half as many magazines these days.\nNow that I've had a taste of early retirement, I'm able to appreciate the concept that less can indeed be more. And I'm beginning to believe that being forced out of the corporate groove may be, next to my marriage, the best thing that ever happened to me.\nABOUT MEN

''It must have taken a whole herd of the Gadarene swine to make up his outfit,'' he says of the lot - a majestic assortment of pigskin shirt cases, collar cases and multifarious containers housing medicine, firearms, hats and helmets.\nEdward Ashburnham's luggage might be the envy of some men even now. For though most travelers these days tend to go light, making do with little more than a sturdy, hanging garment bag and carry-on piece, experts point to a rekindled interest in the kind of luxurious, well-crafted baggage the major owned.\nLong-wearing, substantial pullmans and other rigidly constructed bags hold decided appeal for rising young professionals, the so-called yuppies, and older ones too, says Robert K. Ermatinger, executive vice president of the Luggage and Leather Goods Manufacturers of America. ''The yuppies have become muppies,'' he says. ''As they approach middle age, they are becoming more conservative.'' Instead of soft, pliable satchels, many are choosing hard-framed, and sometimes hard-sided, cases. ''No more rolling up clothes in a duffle bag,'' Mr. Ermatinger says. ''People are buying their luggage for longer-term value.''\nLuggage retailers and merchants agree that the so-called muppies are a market to reckon with. Though no one is predicting a return to the fortresslike steamer truck, a hard-walled miniature closet replete with drawers and hangers, most report increased sales of old-fashioned leather or fabric bags.\nAlthough soft nylon or canvas bags constitute about half his sales, Julius Wein, president of Crouch & Fitzgerald, the New York luggage shop, says constructed leather pieces are noticeably more popular than a year ago. Many of his clients still resist buying leather, believing it to be heavy and unwieldy, but others are discovering its practicality. As Mr. Ermatinger says, ''Leather has to be practical. It's cowhide, you know, and cows run around bumping up against barbed wire.''\nBarneys New York and Givenchy Gentleman in Manhattan also report an intensified demand for rigid-framed leather cases. ''People want leather luggage again,'' says Givenchy's manager, Ed Newell, ''just as they want other luxury items.'' Both stores also do a vigorous business in a new category, the leather weekend attache case. Fitted with separate storage for shirts and toiletries, it is useful to ''the sort of man who goes to Europe for the weekend,'' says Barneys' president, Fred Pressman. Those who prefer a more malleable bag can choose from a widening selection of lightweight leathers by makers such as Tumi or Cassegrain Longchamps.\nMost experts suggest that a bag of fabric or leather be resilient enough to withstand some rough handling. The frame may be relatively rigid - hardwood is most pliant, yielding under stress - but the sides ought to remain flexible and, ideally, padded, for an extra measure of protection. The leather handle should penetrate the bag; rivets, hinges, locks and other fittings should be brass, which tends to resist corrosion. A meticulously constructed bag should also have mitred corners, so that its covering will fit tautly, says Geoffrey A. Krolle, head of Tanner-Krolle, the London luggage maker. He adds that a high-quality leather bag will have hand-sewn corners and edges, and a top-grain cowhide surface with its natural markings intact.\nAt about $800, a 30-inch Tanner-Krolle pullman incorporating such features is costly, Mr. Krolle concedes, but some people find it worth the price. ''It is like a Savile Row suit that is made by hand,'' he says. ''You cannot mass produce it. If you could, it would be made in Hong Kong.'' MEN'S STYLE

Real to whom? The average American woman (at 5 feet 3 1/2 inches) has a 36-29-39 figure and weighs 143 pounds. Logically, one would assume that the industry's most lucrative tactic would be to design clothes that make the greatest number of women look good.

Well, from now on, mention of Harrods must allow for a vision, too, of a little bit of Germany.\nHarrods Ltd. has opened its first airport shop in a new shopping mall at the Frankfurt Airport in West Germany. The venture is the first Harrods shop in Germany and the store's first airport outlet. Another Harrods, in Madrid, is scheduled to open later this month.\nHalf of the store's 3,100 square feet is devoted to the Harrods line of food products and German produce, and a buffet offers visitors an opportunity to dine on the various delicacies (smoked salmon among them) offered for sale, accompanied by wines or Champagne by the glass.\nThe shop also features British men's and women's wear and a selection of accessories, small leather goods, stationery, jewelry and watches. The new store is open from 8 A.M. to 9 P.M. daily. More information is available from Harrods (Knightsbridge, London SW1 7XL, England; 730-1234, extension 3637).\nGolf, Hiking And Rafting in Canada's West By helicopter and raft - and doubtless by more genteel vehicles such as golf carts - a 13-day tour will proceed into western Canada next summer to take in fairway and green as well as spectacular scenery and bronc busters.\nThe medium for all this is the Rocky Mountain Golf and Heli-Hiking Holiday from July 8 to 21, featuring a warmup round at the Willow Park Golf Club in Calgary, play on two new Robert Trent Jones courses nestled between snow-capped mountains in the heart of an Alberta Indian reservation in a region called Kananaskis Country and a final two rounds at Banff Springs and Jasper.\nRounding out all this will be a visit to a Wild West show during the Calgary Stampede, a raft trip up the Bow River and - for the finale - two days of heli-hiking (hikers are dropped into mountain valleys by helicopter at various times of the day) in the Cariboo Range of the Canadian Rockies.\nParticipants will stay in the Lodge at Kananaskis about 45 miles west of Calgary (opening in June as the latest in the Canadian Pacific Railroad's array of luxury resort hotels), at the Banff Springs Hotel and Jasper Park Lodge and at a private ski lodge in the Cariboo Range, where a final golfers' awards party will conclude the festivities.\nBased on double occupancy, the tour is priced at $2,720 a person, including accommodations, most breakfasts and dinners and some lunches, cocktail parties, helicopter and raft trips, a night at the Calgary Stampede, greens fees and prizes and transfers. Golf carts and dinners during two nights in Calgary are not included nor is air fare to Calgary for the start of the tour. From New York, the estimated round-trip fare is $569.\nFor details contact June Breton, Ridgewater Partners (116 Clapboard Ridge Road, Greenwich, Conn. 06830; 203-869-5164).\nIn France, It's Coffee and Quilt In the United States, the term is bed and breakfast. In France, it's cafe-couette, which translates literally as coffee and quilt. And now, more than 1,500 rooms throughout France, including about 250 in Paris, are available through the program, operated by an association of homeowners who rent their lodgings. Based on double occupancy, prices range from $19.50 to $39 a person; single occupancy rates begin at $26 a night. In most cases a minimum stay of three nights is required.\nThe least expensive rooms, bearing the association's three-coffeepot rating, are comfortable, private and offer the hospitality of French hosts who know their regions intimately. The most expensive, with designations up to six coffeepots, are luxurious -perhaps in a villa with private pool or in a chalet near a ski slope. Many rooms are in private chateaus. All rates include Continental breakfast.\nIn the United States, the tour operator known as the French Experience can book cafe-couette accommodations or design an itinerary around the lodgings. In addition, the company arranges bookings in country homes, known as gites, as well as other rentals and tours. (A catalogue listing 500 gites may be obtained for $5).\nMore information may be obtained from the French Experience (171 Madison Avenue, Suite 1505, New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-683-2445).\nStudying Digs While at Sea Definitely off the beaten track is the biblical archeology seminar scheduled for Feb. 1 to 8. Although the subject is the latest digs in the Middle East and their impact on modern understanding of the biblical patriarchs, the Israelite exodus, religion in ancient Israel and the origins of Christianity, the setting is a luxury liner cruising the Caribbean.\nAnd the journey - setting out from Miami and calling at Cancun and Cozumel in Mexico and at Grand Cayman Island and the Norwegian Cruise Line's own island in the Caribbean before returning to Miami - offers an opportunity for optional trips ashore to explore Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza, Tulum and Coba on the Yucatan Peninsula.\nLeading the seminar on the Skyward will be Kyle McCarter, the William F. Albright Professor of Ancient Near Eastern and Biblical Studies at Johns Hopkins University, who will also explain how archeologists dig and how they interpret the artifacts they discover. The seminar is sponsored by the Biblical Archaeology Society.\nBased on double occupancy and depending on the choice of shipboard accommodations, the cruise ranges in price from $1,395 to $1,605 a person. The fare includes seminars and lectures and air transportation to and from Miami.\nThe Biblical Archaeology Society is planning a similar cruise through Alaska's Inside Passage from June 14 to 25. The lecturer will be Yigal Shiloh, the excavation director at the City of David in Jerusalem.\nMore information may be obtained from Janice Krause, Travel/Study Manager, Biblical Archaeology Society (3000 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20008; 202-387-8888).\nIndian Market In Colorado In the middle of January more than 400 American Indian artists representing 90 tribal nations of the Americas are scheduled to gather at Currigan Exhibition Hall in downtown Denver for a three-day event: the Colorado Indian Market.\nThe exhibition, demonstration and sale of art - jewelry, painting, Navajo rugs, kachina dolls, knives and warclubs, fetishes, South American pottery and weaving, masks, bead- and quillwork, clothing and the like - will be accompanied by continuous performances of traditional dancing and music. American Indian food will also be available.\nThe Colorado Indian Market, scheduled for 11 A.M. to 8 P.M. on Jan. 16, 17 and 18, comes at a time of year that coincides with the ski season in Colorado and with the National Western Stock Show and Rodeo, the huge livestock show that has been a January fixture since 1906.\nAdmission to the Colorado Indian Market will be $4, $2 for those under 12 and over 65, except on Friday, Jan. 16, when the fees will be $2 and $1, respectively.\nMore information is available from the Colorado Indian Market (Post Office Box 13006, Boulder, Colo. 80308; 303-447-9967).\nFestival Time: Vermont's Way With Winter For devotees of winter activities like sled dog competitions, broom hockey and a triathlon of cross-country skiing, skating and snoeshoeing, things are heating up. These events as well as snow golf, skating parties and fireworks are planned at the Newport Winterfest on Jan. 30 and 31 and Feb. 1, 7 and 8.\nBut such Vermont festivities are not confined to Newport. Brookfield will hold a three-day Winter Ice Festival, Jan. 30 to Feb. 1, with ice harvesting, dog team demonstrations, family cross-country ski racing and areas for sledding and sleigh rides.\nThe winter schedule in Vermont also includes telemark skiing festivals, ice fishing derbies, junior ski jumping championships, antiques shows, maple festivals and the United States Open Snowboarding Championships, March 6 to 8, in Stratton.\nFree Vermont winter information is available from the Vermont Travel Division (Department R722, 134 State Street, Montpelier, Vt. 05602; 802-828-3236).\nTRAVEL ADVISORY

The offerings take various forms, and all should get close scrutiny to be sure they suit you.\nOne such offering, in fact, is called Impulse. It is a gold plastic card, offered for $49.95 for the first year, that promises the holder 50 percent off the regular advertised room rate at more than 400 hotels and resorts in the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas and the Caribbean. It also offers discounts on some Hertz automobile rentals and Cunard cruises. If you book your air transportation through Cashback Travel, a Denver-based travel agency that has a joint marketing program with Impulse, you get up to a 5 percent rebate, depending on the cost of your flights.\nThe heart of the Impulse offering is its hotel plan, which embraces such This is the second of two columns on cut-rate travel deals. places as the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston, the Snowmass Club in Colorado and many Marriott hotels. Your reservations must be made through Impulse and within 14 days of check-in - which means you cannot plan very far ahead. You can stay any number of days, however, and any days of the week, and the company says that once a reservation is made, it is guaranteed.\nBut at popular hotels, especially those that cater to large groups and conventions, don't expect rooms to be available on short notice in high season. On the other hand, when business is slack, many hotels offer the general public sharply reduced rates over weekends and sometimes in midweek, too - rates that cannot be further discounted through Impulse.\nDespite such caveats Impulse can still be a good deal if you are flexible, because sometimes hotels do develop hard-to-fill vacancies on short notice. Your Impulse discount on one night could easily cover the $49.95 you paid as dues (which the company says are normally $75). Impulse is a program of Access International, 6143 South Willow Drive, Suite 106, Englewood, Colo. 80111 (800-251-8853, except 303-740-8700 in Colorado).

It can be reached nationwide at 800-458-2274. Solicitation by TelephoneAnother type of impulse marketing caught the attention of Jean Martinetti, a legal secretary from Flemington, N.J. Last September, she said, she was solicited by telephone by Resort Telemarketing of Texas, Inc., based in Houston, and agreed that her MasterCard account be debited for $289 for a ''vacation passport voucher'' that supposedly entitled her to an array of travel bargains.\nSoon, she said, she received the voucher - No. 116602, issued by the Amy Travel Service of Naperville, Ill. - in a mailing dated Sept. 22 that detailed the terms of the purchase. It said it entitled her to buy two round-trip air tickets to a destination such as Acapulco, Jamaica, Hawaii, Las Vegas or London, plus lodging for seven nights, ''for the cost not to exceed that of one round-trip standard, all year, full economy (Y-class) air fare.'' Following instructions, Mrs. Martinetti said in a telephone interview in mid-December, she mailed her voucher on Oct. 27 to Amy Travel, requesting that she fly from Newark to London on Jan. 16, 23 or 30 for a week's vacation there. She was to have received an acknowledgement within seven business days, but she said she had heard nothing further and was trying to get a refund of the $289 on the ground that the offer had not been fulfilled.\nThe $289, according to the voucher Mrs. Martinetti received, is nonrefundable. The mailing said the $289 merely entitled her to buy a vacation package but would not be applied toward its cost. In her case, the cost itself could be as much as $1,462, or the price of a full-fare economy round trip between New York and London on a major airline. Under current promotional offerings of British Airways, however, she and a companion could buy a similar package for $1,496, without having to pay $289 for the privilege. Amy Travel guarantees to pay triple the difference in cash ''if you can find the same lodging as we offer and the same air fares for a lesser amount,'' but that does not include the cost of the voucher.\nIn an interview on Dec. 23, after I had asked Amy employees several times about Mrs. Martinetti, she said the agency had just telephoned her to say her reservations were ready. ''I said 'Forget it, I can't leave on such short notice,' '' Mrs. Martinetti said later. Debbie Frey, an assistant manager at Amy Travel, said failure to contact Mrs. Martinetti sooner must have been an unintentional slipup.\nWilliam E. Jackman, a spokesman for the Airlines Reporting Corporation, an industry group that regulates the sale of air tickets through travel agencies, said Amy ''is O.K. with us.''\nA November report on Amy by the Better Business Bureau of Chicago and Northern Illinois said it had received complaints of improper handling of travel arrangements and misrepresentation of costs. Asked about this, James Weiland, president of Amy, said, ''We've got thousands of happy clients'' but that ''when you sell over the phone you've always got somebody who thinks they're getting something free and doesn't understand the offer.'' Offers by PostcardAccording to Eunice Baros, an assistant attorney general in Florida, her office in Miami has taken action in about 50 cases involving postcards and other mailings sent all over the country that seem to offer free or exceptionally low-cost vacations in her state and elsewhere.\n''Great News!'' one such postcard was headlined. ''You have been approved to receive a fabulous Florida vacation offer! You may choose from a variety of exciting BEACH RESORT AREAS . . . PLUS this vacation includes ORLANDO - home of DISNEY WORLD, EPCOT, AND SEAWORLD. You may vacation between now and Dec. 15, 1987, but you MUST CALL IMMEDIATELY to claim your vacation.''\nResponding to one such postcard sent to my home in Pennsylvania, I was told that two nights in the Orlando area and two contiguous nights elsewhere in Florida for two people between 25 and 62 years old traveling together were mine free for a one-time service fee of $89.95, to be charged to a major credit card. As a bonus, I was offered a separate four-night vacation for two in Mexico. Air fare and meals were not included. When I vacillated on the telephone, I was offered the Florida accommodations alone for $59.95 if I responded at once. I declined and was told that the offer would not be repeated.\nMrs. Baros and Dorothy Carroll, an analyst for the Florida Division of Consumer Services in Tallahassee, said such offers followed a familiar pattern. ''You pay your money up front,'' Mrs. Carroll said, ''and they say they need 30 to 60 days' advance notice to get you a reservation. Often when you have reserved, they call and ask you to postpone it. They really wear the people down by not giving them what they want. Then the company goes out of business and walks away with the money or offers them something far inferior to what they expected.''\nConsumer-affairs specialists strongly advise that you never give a credit card number in response to a telephone offering until you are sure that the company is legitimate; if in doubt, check with the Better Business Bureau in the town nearest the company's headquarters.\nUsing the words ''chosen'' or ''selected'' on a postcard does not mean you have won anything, merely that you have been selected to receive an offer. Read all the rules of any agreement carefully; determine all the costs involved. And before leaving home, telephone the hotel or resort directly to confirm that you have a paid reservation.\nA brochure entitled ''Have You Won a Vacation?'' is available if you send 25 cents plus a self-addressed long envelope with a 22-cent stamp to the Council of Better Business Bureaus, 1515 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Va. 22209. Consumers with complaints about offerings in Florida should send documented letters to Eunice Baros, Assistant Attorney General, 401 Northwest Second Avenue, Room 460, Miami, Fla. 33128.

C. H., Dolgeville, N.Y. Answer:An eight-day trip called Holland Holiday visits bulb fields, gardens and other sites in spring and summer, including April and May, when the tulips, daffodils and other flowers are in bloom.\nTulip Time Question:Where can one arrange a trip to the Netherlands in the spring when the tulips are in bloom? -M. C. H., Dolgeville, N.Y. Answer:An eight-day trip called Holland Holiday visits bulb fields, gardens and other sites in spring and summer, including April and May, when the tulips, daffodils and other flowers are in bloom. It is operated by Maupintour (408 East 50th Street, New York, N.Y. 10022; 212-688-4106 and 800-255-4266, which can be called from New York). Departures and return are on Saturdays. The itinerary includes the 70-acre Keukenhof Gardens at Lisse, the showcase of the bulb industry, as well as The Hague, the Delft pottery factory in Rotterdam and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. A guide accompanies each group and the land cost of $1,498 a person, double occupancy, includes hotels, 13 meals and tour bus. The tour uses KLM for the flight from New York to Amsterdam, which, depending on date, costs from $448 to $628, round trip.\nAnother way to see the spring flowers is from a 100-passenger ship that cruises along the canals and rivers of the Netherlands. A program combining this seven-night cruise and three nights in Amsterdam is offered by Sea Air Holidays (733 Summer Street, Stamford, Conn. 06901; 203-356-9033 and 800-732-6247). The price, excluding air fare but including most meals and sightseeing ashore, is $2,079. The cruise on its own costs from $1,199. The ship leaves Amsterdam on six consecutive Saturdays starting April 4. Battlefields Question:Where can I find information about escorted tours of the Normandy battlefields? - H. W., New York Answer:World War II sites in Normandy are included in tours from the United States and on shorter trips from Paris, all of them escorted. One of the longer ones, a 15-day ''March to Victory'' tour, is offered by Battlefield Tours (1680 Old Spanish Trail, Slidell, La. 70458; 504-641-4422 or, out of state, 800-321-9412). The tour starts with a flight to London and a visit to Southampton, goes across the Channel by ferry to Cherbourg and continues to Caen, Paris, Rheims and Aachen, West Germany. The return flight is from Frankfurt. There are departures on June 26, Aug. 14 and Sept. 21, and the cost of $1,995 a person, double occupancy, includes trans-Atlantic round-trip air fare, hotels, most meals and guides.\nGalaxy Tours (Post Office Box 234, Wayne, Pa. 19087; 215-254-6600 or 800-523-7287), which has organized visits to Normandy for 28 years, does a lot of trips for veterans of specific military units who want to retrace their own routes. But it also has a general tour, scheduled for June 1. The 10-day trip includes London and Paris as well as the beaches and other landmarks in Normandy. The land-only cost will be about $900 a person.\nFrom Beach to Bastogne is the name of a nine-day trip, departing June 11 and Sept. 26, with Tours of Historic and Important Places (Post Office Box 203, Mountain Lakes, N.J. 07046; 201-335-8316). The cost of $1,599 includes air fare.\nA one-day visit to the Normandy landing beaches and other sites can be taken from Paris through City Rama (347 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-683-8120). Its program is on Tuesday and Friday from April 17 through October. The one-day tour, by bus and back to Paris by train, costs $113, including lunch. Eleuthera Question:Would you please give some information on the Cotton Bay Club in Eleuthera, the Bahamas? I never see it mentioned any more. We stayed there some time ago. -M. F. P., Edison, N.J. Answer:By all accounts, the Cotton Bay Club near Rock Sound, Eleuthera, continues to flourish. The resort is one of the few in the Bahamian Family Islands with an 18-hole golf course, and it also has its own marina and four tennis courts. There are 77 rooms, about half of them in the main lodge, the remainder in cottages and villas in the gardens. Rates this winter are from $254 to $302 a day for two people, breakfast and dinner included. Reservations can be made through Hotels of Distinction (800-843-2297) or the Bahamas Reservation Service (800-327-0787). The address is: Cotton Bay Club, Post Office Box 28, Rock Sound, Eleuthera, Bahamas; 809-334-2101. Yugoslavia by Bus Question:Will there be bus tours of Yugoslavia next summer, and where can reservations be made? - J. F., Philadelphia Answer:Several tours are scheduled from April through October, many of them taking in the Dalmatian coast and visiting Dubrovnik. Some either begin or end in Zagreb, which, like Dubrovnik, is a gateway city for international flights. For travelers making their own way to Yugoslavia who are interested only in land arrangements, there are some Yugoslav travel agencies with respresentatives in New York that make reservations.\nAmong them are Atlas Ambassador (60 East 42d Street, New York, N.Y. 10165; 212-697-6767) and General Tourist (212 East 47th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017; 212-935-3022). Both offer escorted tours of eight days from about $420 a person, double occupancy. Their prices include hotels, with private shower or bath, most meals and sightseeing. Travel agents can book bus tours with Yugotours (350 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10118; 212-563-2400 or 800-223-5298), whose prices include international, round-trip air fare as well as hotels and two meals a day. A 10-day itinerary, including 2 nights in Dubrovnik, costs, from New York, from $958 to $1,308. Departures are on Tuesdays. A two-week tour, with visits to Belgrade and Sarajevo, leaves on Thursdays and is $1,209 to $1,598.\nA Yugoslav bus tour is also available with Saga Holidays (120 Boylston Street, Boston, Mass. 02116; 617-451-6808 or 800-343-0273), which caters to travelers aged 55 and over and deals directly with the public. Saga has a 17-night trip, with four departures in April and three in May, all on Mondays. The tour includes one night in London on the outward and return journeys. Price, including round-trip air fare from New York, hotels and three meals a day: $1,409. Readers are invited to send written questions about travel to Q & A, Travel Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

969	FRENCH COOKING BY THE BOOKS	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D6173EF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Paris offers sublime dining, the finest ingredients at shops and markets, and bookshops selling cookbooks that can turn the latter into the former.\nParis offers sublime dining, the finest ingredients at shops and markets, and bookshops selling cookbooks that can turn the latter into the former.\nThe newest of these is the bright, inviting Librairie Gourmande near the Place St.-Michel on the Left Bank. A tantalizing aroma of a savory stew drifts to the door, making food lovers feel at home right away. Genevieve Baudon has lunch for herself and her husband, Marcel, simmering on the stove downstairs. It's chicken. ''I'm crazy about food,'' she explains, giving her own well-rounded cheek a pinch. ''That's why I started collecting cookbooks.''\nThe greatest chefs of France have been writing cookbooks for centuries (in French, of course), and the collection, begun 30 years ago, eventually took over two rooms in the Baudons' apartment, so she decided to start selling them at her husband's stall on the Quai Demontebello. Her husband, a bouquiniste, sells new and used books on an assortment of subjects on the quai.\nLast year she opened the shop. Her own collection is the basis for the 6,000 or so volumes in the inventory. ''The first time I sold one of my books,'' she said, ''I was afraid I would have pangs of regret, but I didn't because it was bringing such pleasure to the person who bought it. For them, buying a cookbook is not like buying a novel. They have a friend, a companion in the kitchen.''\nThe majority of the books in the shop are in French. ''I often get inquiries for books on French cooking in English,'' she said, ''but most of what I have in English is on British or American food.'' Mrs. Boudon herself speaks very little English.\nThe books in the shop are organized by topic, with sections on provincial cooking, cooking of various countries, pastry making, cheeses, vegetarian food, wines and table decorations. One section is devoted to books published from 1900 to 1960, after which there was boom in the cookbook business and a proliferation of titles. New releases and best sellers are displayed on a table in the center.\nBehind Mrs. Baudon's cluttered desk is a glass case with rare volumes. ''Le Cuisinier Francais'' by La Varenne, is priced at $930. It was published in 1689; its fragile pages are bound in mottled tooled leather. A new acquisition, not yet priced, is a two-volume edition of ''Le Nouveau Cuisinier Royal et Bourgeois'' by Vincent de la Chapelle written in 1734. A copy of Marin's ''Dons de Comus'' published in 1739, is in mint condition and priced at $1,400.\nPosters large and small, many of them from the 1930's advertising aperitifs, others of botanical charts showing varieties of mushrooms or fruits, are some of the other food-related items carried in the book-filled shop. Some of the posters are on display in the large picture window that fronts the street. Prices start at about $8. A few antique molds in pottery and metal hang on the wall near the glass door and are also for sale. On a table by the window is a group of cookbooks for children, including one by Paul Bocuse, ''La Journee du Cuisinier'' (Etudes Vivantes), for about $13.\nMrs. Baudon said her customers are either professional collectors seeking rare books - and from whom she sometime buys books as well - or people looking for particular cookbooks, mostly the newer ones. Right now books by chefs are in big demand. She has trouble keeping ''La Nouvelle Cuisine Classique'' by the Roux Brothers in stock. (This book, originally published in England, is available in an American edition called ''The New Classic Cuisine'' published by Barron's in 1984).\nSome of the other popular current titles are: ''Ma Cuisine Pour Vous'' by Joel Robuchon (Laffont), ''Le Grand Livre de la Cuisine a la Vapeur'' by Jacques Manire (De Noel), ''La Passion de Chocolat'' by the famous chocolatier from Lyons, Jean Bernachon (Flammarion) and ''Toute Cuisine de la Mer'' by the chefs of Le Duc restaurant in Paris (Olivier Orban). Most of these books cost $20 to $30. Mrs. Baudon said there had been some demand for ''Dining in France'' based on the series aired recently on American public television. Escoffier's ''Guide Culinaire'' (Flammarion) is a favorite.\nA series by Yves Thuries is beautifully done and, as of now, consists of seven volumes. Each book covers a different topic -among them are fish pates and terrines -and can be purchased individually or as a set. The lavishly illustrated leather-bound books are $132 each.\nThe ''Almanach Historique de la Gastronomie Francaise'' by Christian Guy (Hachette) includes such details as drunken revolutionaries noted on June 25, 1793, by the American ambassador to Paris, and a letter written by Voltaire on March 12, 1734, in which he confesses to a friend that his stomach can't take ''la nouvelle cuisine.''\nSome of her clients are the great chefs of France. Pierre Troisgros is ''interested in books with exotic recipes, foreign foods, Japanese,'' Mrs. Baudon said, ''not old collectors' items.'' Jean-Paul Lacombe of Leon de Lyon and Jacques Maniere also stop by. Sometimes chefs have books from their own collections to sell. Mrs. Baudon has purchased volumes offered by Henri Faugeron of Faugeron in Paris and Marc Meneau of L'Esperance in St. Pere-sous-Vezelay.\nMrs. Baudon said she has seen a shift in taste recently. ''Young people seem to be more interested in good home cooking, and traditional bourgeois recipes adapted for modern kitchens. They like a full plate,'' she added, ''but for me, I still enjoy nouvelle cuisine because it gives me the chance to sample a variety of tastes.''\nMrs. Baudon will search for out-of-print books or others that she may not carry. She will also mail books to customers. But nothing gives her more pleasure than talking about food with those who enjoy it as much as she does, pulling books off the shelves and browsing through menus and recipes.\nWeights, measures and volumes\nMeasurements in French cookbooks are usually given in metric weights and volumes rather than in cups and ounces, and temperatures are indicated in Centigrade. Also, in some cookbooks, especially older ones, tableware such as coffee spoons and wineglasses may be used for measuring instead of calibrated measuring utensils. A working knowledge of French is necessary for using the French recipes.\nLa Librairie Gourmande, 4 Rue Dante, Paris 75005, (telephone 43.54.37.37) is open Monday through Saturday 10 A.M. to 7 P.M., Sunday noon to 7 P.M.\nOther Cookbook Specialists Au Bain Marie, 2 Rue du Mail, Paris 75002 (42.60.94.55).\nLe Verre et l'Assiette, 1 Rue du Val-de-Grace, Paris 75005 (46.33.45.96).\nEdgar Soete, 5 Quai Voltaire, Paris 75007 (42.60.72.41).F.

It's a symbol, much as Malibu has become a symbol, of certain California styles and archetypes.\nLaguna Beach, about halfway down the coast between Los Angeles and San Diego isn't merely what it is - a gorgeous, overly built, urgently touristed, maddeningly trafficked, adorable beach paradise with perfect weather and old-fashioned crystal-clear air. It's a symbol, much as Malibu has become a symbol, of certain California styles and archetypes. When foreigners from, say, San Francisco, or the East Coast, visit Laguna they murmur, ''Oh, this is soooo Southern California,'' several times a day, having validated all their mythology of laconic, ''heeey, no problem,'' chronically tanned existence -life lived as a ripe avocado.\nLaguna Beach is the ultimate small-town escape - where people move when stressed to the max by the medium-fast lane of once-drowsy San Diego. Or when the demands of the L.A. scene are about to catapult them over the edge. The irony herein is that most of America believes this portion of the planet to be one long nap altogether.\nLaguna Beach is the major manifestation, by my totally informal and uncertifiable survey, of America's most noteworthy population of sun-bleached, perfectly sculptured and browned male bodies of varying ages who pass their summers, springs, winters and falls perched alone on cumbersome slats in the middle of the Pacific, staring hypnotically at waves until they eventually catch a quick jolt of a ride. And, equivalently, poised with infinite patience on the sand, is a cast of thousands of bikinied lasses with sun-streaked hair and flawless teeth, downing dozens of Cokes and thousands of tortilla chips, their blue eyes fastened on their lads out at sea, like fishermen's wives of old whose lot in life was waiting, waiting.\nThe ocean and the beach form the essence, the matrix of Laguna life. Weekends are crowded year round, as the weather falls consistently in that narrow range of divine - 85 in the summer, 70 in the winter. It's a classic beach weekend, with all the pleasures of water sporting and beach vegetating. There are heart-stopping sunsets to be viewed with drink in hand from a variety of terrace bars. There are bed and breakfasts, motels and one utterly extraordinary hotel - the Ritz-Carlton - which is the main reason, in my view, to travel to Laguna. There are several quite good restaurants and the very best Chinese restaurant I've come upon in California, or perhaps in America. Lots of shops. Hundreds of shops.\nThere is an extensive artists community in Laguna that produces some fine crafts, furniture, jewelry and the usual scattering of oil paintings of palm trees. Browsing through the galleries and studios is part of any Laguna sojourn. Weavers, candlemakers, potters, glass blowers and silversmiths have found homes and display spaces in this little town. And there seems to be some sort of arts festival happening throughout the summer. Strolling the narrow streets is the way to discover what is there.\nThere are so many shops in Laguna that one can simply meander the streets for hours. Shebue on Pacific Coast Highway sells lovely handprinted silk fabrics, suedes and knits; State of the Arts on Glenneyre Street has unusual modern jewelry. Try the Bluebird Center across from the Surf and Sand for a bunch of stores, Forest Avenue for the best boutiques and locally designed jewelry and the Pottery Shack for an endless array of dishes and kitchenware sold at discount and glass-blowing demonstrations.\nThere is no night life to speak of in Laguna, but a couple of movie theaters and an ear-splitting disco or two for the surfing gods and goddesses. If you must, visit the White House, but armed with earplugs.\nLaguna is actually tiny, five square miles, with only three and a half miles of coastline. Steep hillsides and green sloping canyons border the inland side of the Pacific Coast Highway, the main route that bisects Laguna as it winds its way circuitously up and down the entire California coastline. In the early 1900's the town was begun as a colony for artists, sculptors and craftsmen, but its population - even among the explosion of Orange County growth - has remained at only 19,000. New building is not encouraged by the citizens of Laguna, so that most of the fabulous, secluded cliff-top homes overlooking the beach and once inhabited by the likes of Bette Davis, Mary Pickford, Garland, Valentino, Chaplin and Mickey Rooney have been there for decades.\nThe overwhelming attraction of Laguna Beach is the two-year-old Ritz-Carlton Hotel, in Laguna Niguel, just a few miles south of the town. The Ritz-Carlton is surely on the level of the most wonderful resort hotels I've ever visited - Caneel Bay and Little Dix Bay in the Virgin Islands, Mauna Kea and Mauna Lani on the Big Island of Hawaii, Villa d'Este on Lake Como. The kind of resort where the natural beauty is perfectly married to the taste and design of the hotel, where each bit of decor, service and food is brilliantly managed.\nFor instance, the Ritz-Carlton Club in the Monarch Wing on the fourth, top floor of the hotel, reached only by a special elevator key. The elevator opens onto a sitting room presided over by a concierge whose role it is to serve the guests in every way - making massage reservations, fixing a drink from the open (and free) bar, freshening up the ever-present array of breakfast pastries, fruit, hors d'oeuvres, even making dinner arrangements for you at other restaurants in town. The rooms are charming and comfortable, as are each of the 393 rooms in the hotel.\nAlthough the Ritz-Carlton is relatively new, the sense upon driving up to the enormous porte-cochere and entering the typically California Spanish Mediterranean architecture, is that you might just bump into William Randolph Hearst or Louis B. Mayer in white linen suits, or any of the towering figures of a past regal Hollywood age. For this is truly a grand hotel, from the large public rooms with Italian marble, handwoven rugs and vases overflowing with fresh flowers, to the darkly elegant bar with year-round roaring fire, to the impressive art and antiques collection to the beauty of the setting - poised on a cliff 150 feet above the beach.\nOne never yearns to move too far from the airy, spacious lobby with its afternoon high tea served in the library, or its buffet lunch, eaten while gazing through the massive French windows overlooking the sea. To do little else but stroll around and, over a glass of cream sherry in the lounge, watch the sun set, while a dignified pianist accompanies the magic, is surely a weekend of heaven.\nMost folks, we are told, do not leave the hotel grounds for days at a time, even for golf on the Links at Monarch Beach, the course next door designed by Robert Trent Jones, but certainly not to confront the Laguna Sunday scene up the highway. A walk, jog or swim on one of California's loveliest beaches below is appropriate, but when blissful inertia utterly takes over, there is a little shuttle to transport guests down and up the steep hill to the sand.\nRooms at the Ritz-Carlton are sumptuously decorated, from the marble baths to the French doors that open to small terraces to the plush carpeting. There are 31 suites, and while staying in one, we counted five telephones. There are two swimming pools with Jacuzzis inside quiet courtyards, and probably to be stressed above all other visual wonders are the flowers and the landscaping, the product of 16 full-time gardeners. Two hundred fifty thousand new plants are installed every year, and the explosions of color throughout the property are a feast. If one is compelled to move one's body, the fitness center is well-equipped and offers frequent exercise classes. I rode a stationary bike one morning next to O. J. Simpson, a Laguna resident.\nFood at the Ritz-Carlton is the finest in the area, with a focus on fresh fish and seafood, prepared in that California cuisine style that mixes ingredients that may or may not be a match made in heaven. The dining room is elegant, with tuxedoed waiters and prices to match; our steamed salmon in sorrel sauce ($24) and Spanish red scampi in cilantro, tomato and sweet garlic sauce ($26) were splendid. The cafe is somewhat more casual and features trendy items like braised veal loin with porcini mushrooms ($17) and blackened beef filet in mustard-roquefort sauce ($21). The sunny Cafe Terrace for lunch and the mammoth Sunday brunch ($30) brings visitors from as far as Los Angeles. The Club Grill and Bar is fun for dancing to live music and offers a menu more traditionally American.\nIn addition to the Ritz-Carlton, the exciting find in Laguna Beach is a wonderful Chinese restaurant, Five Feet (714-497-4955), in the middle of town. Billing itself as Chinese cuisine European style, it is not of the usual put-it-all-in-the-middle-and-share school, although that is precisely what one wants to do anyway. The specialty here is whole catfish ($21 to $23), brought in from Louisiana and prepared in a sweet and pungent sauce. The waiter told us the fish is such an unassailable tradition that practically every table orders one. We returned several nights in a row and were ecstatic over an appetizer of fresh mussels with black bean sauce ($7), seafood pasta ($16.50) and duck salad mixed with crabmeat in an orange and lemon sauce ($13.95).\nThe joy of returning to Laguna over and over, as we do for periodic weekends during the year, is that each visit requires less and less activity. We've long since paid our tourist dues to the art-show-of-the-month, browsed the cute shops sufficient times. Now we can contentedly vegetate in that special splendor of air, sun and the Pacific that marks the entire California coast but nowhere with more loveliness than here.\nIf you go\nGetting There Driving time is 75 minutes from Los Angeles International Airport, 65 minutes from San Diego and 30 minutes from John Wayne-Orange County Airport.\nWhere to Stay Rooms at the Ritz-Carlton (telephone: 714-240-2000) range from $155 to $275 a night, suites from $500 to $1,500.\nEiler's Inn (714-494-3004) on Pacific Coast Highway is a favorite bed and breakfast. Rooms for two are $85 to $150, including breakfast and wine and cheese in the afternoon.\nThe Hotel Laguna (714-494-1151) is conveniently situated on the highway and the beach, and its outdoor terrace has a bar that is popular at sunset. Double rooms range from $65 to $85. The Surf and Sand (714-497-4477) is also on the beach, with a busy bar. Rooms for two are $85 to $140.\nWhere to Eat Ron's (714-497-4871) in Laguna is another popular spot, with a charming terrace right on Pacific Coast Highway, a jazz trio or pianist, and an unsurprising but excellent menu. The fish is always fresh and the rack of lamb is tender. Dinner for two, with wine, is about $75. There is also a champagne brunch for $14.50 on weekends. Dizz's As Is (714-494-5250) is good for such complications as filet mignon topped with bacon and pate ($20.95), or Pesto Genovese with prawns ($20.95).\nFor a traditional Mexican lunch on a superb terrace overlooking the ocean, try Las Brisas (714-497-5434). Lunch for two, with beer, is about $25. M. S.

Skiers arriving by train from Montreal were met by horse-drawn sleighs and driven to pensions to be warmed by steaming pea soup, tourtiere - and whisky, banned in the United States, but legal in Canada.\nToday, much of the same hospitality and joie de vivre are still to be found at a score of ski centers and neighboring towns. The closest is less than a one-hour drive from downtown Montreal, and especially attractive to Americans because the United States dollar is worth $1.40 in Canada. The region is primarily French-speaking, but English is spoken in all hotels and most restaurants and ski centers. Skiing Serious skiers head for Mont Tremblant (819-425-8711 or 800-567-6761 from the Eastern United States). At 3,001 feet it's the tallest of the skiing Laurentians, good-sized rolling hills best suited for novice-to-intermediate downhill skiing and cross-country touring. Eighty miles north of Montreal, Mont Tremblant has 33 runs, from the harrowing Flying Mile, a steep, narrow chute, to the gentle Sissy Schuss, almost three miles long and wide as a golf fairway. Skiers take two chairlifts, or about 20 minutes plus another 15 in a lift line, to reach the summit. A lift ticket costs $15 to $18 a day or $78 for five days, with a four-day lesson package of $60. For skiers aged 6 to 12 and over 65, it's $12 daily and $53 for five days; children under 6 ski for free. (All prices are given in United States dollars.) Mont St. Sauveur (514-227-4671), one hour from downtown Montreal, is among the largest - 22 runs - and most popular centers in the southern Laurentians, attracting up to 5,000 skiers on a busy Sunday. A second four-passenger chairlift was installed this year, and it has reduced the wait on lift lines from about 20 minutes to 15. Tickets are $14 weekdays, $15 on weekends; children under four ski for free, five to 12 for $8; those over 60 pay $12. Five-day tickets cost $50.\nMont St. Sauveur, along with Ski Morin Heights (514-226-1333) in Morin Heights and Vallee Bleu (819-322-3427) in Val David have added child care this year (approximately $7 a day).\nAuberge Mont Gabriel (514-229-3547), a resort hotel with its own ski hill near the town of Mont Rolland, and Mont St. Sauveur, with 97 percent of its trails lighted for night skiing, are favorites after dark and both have insulating cushions on their chairlifts. A four-passenger chairlift that opened this season at Mont Gabriel will serve a new advanced-level run, the Coup du Monde, site of the only Canadian stop of the World Cup of Acrobatic Skiing this Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\nThe Far Hills Inn (819-322-2014 or 800-567-6636), three miles east of Val Morin, is the acknowledged leader in organizing cross-country ski touring ($2 for nonguests), rentals and instruction. Seventy miles of trails, over frozen lakes and wooded mountains, connect with the Maple Leaf Trail and a total Laurentian network of about 2,500 miles, including 30 miles of trails of the resort hotel l'Esterel (514-228-2571) in Ville d'Esterel, where ski-school director Bill Deskin trains older people as well as blind and disabled skiers. Where to Stay Le Chantecler in Ste. Adele (514-229-3555) offers the most complete package in the southern Laurentians. Big enough to accommodate more than 300, the large fieldstone manor house has a comfortable country look with knotty pine walls, brass corridor lamps and rooms with large windows, newly decorated with traditional pine furniture and calico quilts. A six-night rate of $400 a person includes breakfast and dinner, seven days' skiing on Le Chantecler's 22-run hill and cross-country trails, ski instruction by a team of 70 and access to an indoor fitness center, pool and racquet courts. Two nights with three days of skiing and meals is $135 a person. (Rates given are a person in double occupancy during regular season, including tax and sevice, except where noted. Ski weeks begin Sunday nights and many weekend packages are available.) A six-night package with meals at the more modest Auberge Mont Gabriel (514-229-3547) is $285 to $350 a person.\nGray Rocks Inn (819-425-2771) in St. Jovite emphasizes learn-to-ski weeks. A turreted Victorian mansion and its annexes can accommodate up to 550 guests. Lodging ranges from rooms with shared baths to deluxe with fireplaces. Rates of $400 to $635 a person include six nights, three meals daily, seven days of skiing at Gray Rocks' own hill, 22 hours of instruction and access to cross-country trails, a health club and indoor pool.\nCondominiums offer good value, particularly for groups of four or more. An example is Village Mont St. Sauveur (514-227-4671) at the base of the ski hill. For five nights, a two-bedroom apartment rents for $320 for two people, $400 for four and, using the living room, $490 for six. Baby-sitting is available, and a 22 percent discount is offered on lift tickets at Mont St. Sauveur, just outside the door. A five-night, six-day package with lessons and day or night skiing is $270 a person without meals.\nThe deluxe Auberge St. Denis (514-227-4766), a small lodge a quarter-mile from Mont St. Sauveur is known for its French cuisine. Rates for five nights are $295 to $320 a person with dinner and breakfast or $170 to $200 a person with full breakfast. The inn's dining rooms are open to nonguests.\nHotel packages with meals are available also for cross-country skiers. At the Far Hills Inn, a 75-room hotel, a five-night package for $280 plus 10 percent service charge includes trail passes, lessons and use of an indoor pool and squash courts. Hotel l'Esterel, a modern resort on 5,000 acres with an indoor pool and gymnasium, matches that five-night rate of $280. At the Alpine Inn (514-229-3516) in Ste. Marguerite, a 100-room lodge with chalets, five nights cost $215 to $242. The smaller Auberge du Vieux Foyer (819-322-2686) in Val David has 23 rooms at $146 a person without private bath, or $196 with, for five nights.\nFarther north, up to 750 guests at Station Mont Tremblant Lodge (819-425-8711 or 800-567-6761) can ski about 50 yards to the mountain's southside chairlift. A five-night package ($340 to $480) includes six days' skiing, breakfasts and dinners, and 16 hours of instruction. It's $120 to $180 for two nights and lift tickets for three days.\nTyrolean-style chalets mask deluxe modern interiors at Cuttles Mont Tremblant club condominiums (819-425-2731 or 800-225-2550). A two-bedroom apartment, sleeping four or five, costs $430 to $570 for five nights, without meals, and a six-day ski package at Mont Tremblant ($112 a person) includes 22 hours of instruction. Meals are available in the main lodge for $18 a person a day; a pool and health club are new this year.\nThe Association Touristique des Laurentides or Laurentian Tourist Information Office (14142 Rue de Lachapelle, Rural Route 1, St. Jerome, Quebec J7Z 5T4; 514-436-8532) can provide information or make lodging reservations. Mont Tremblant has its own reservations office (819-425-8681). Where to Dine Le St. Trop (514-229-3298) in Ste. Adele set the standard for haute cuisine in the Laurentians six years ago. Much of the produce is imported, but concessions are made to Quebec with local foie gras, fresh salmon and lamb. Dinner for two is about $70, plus wine.\nAt l'Eau a la Bouche (514-229-4151), one mile north of Ste. Adele, chef Anne Desjardins and her husband, Pierre Audette, the maitre d'hotel, of-fer sturgeon caviar from northern Ontario's Lake Nipissing with whipped sour cream and paper-thin corn crepes as well as milk-fed Quebec veal, Nova Scotia scallops and pheasant, locally bagged, in light cream sauces. Dinner for two is about $50, plus wine.\nLa Petite Sologne (514-227-6436) is among the newest of St. Sauveur's 48 restaurants. Chef Michel Jourdin prepares simple recipes from his native Sologne in France. The table d'hote dinner is $25 for two plus wine; look also for smoked salmon, steak with black peppercorns or duck with peaches and, for dessert, souffle glace. A menu of Italian dishes along with valet parking and fireplaces attract a fashionable crowd at Da Tulio's (514-227-4313) in St. Sauveur. Dinner for two is about $45 plus wine, and among specialties are linguine fra diavolo and vitello misto.\nCross-country skiers stop for lunch in Val David at the 50-year-old La Sapiniere hotel (819-322-2020). A buffet ($16) every Saturday features many of the dining room's specialties: salad of mussels and celery remoulade, onion quiche, smoked trout, roast beef and pies. The Rotisserie au Petit Poucet (819-322-2246) is a big, family-style place known for its breakfast - fresh orange juice, eggs, maple-cured bacon, smoked ham and baked beans ($7). Just outside Val David at Auberge du Vieux Foyer (819-322-2686), soup and a sandwich cost $4.\nIn St. Jovite, a hearty traditional Quebecois dinner ($28 for two plus wine) at La Table Enchantee (819-425-7113), consists of potage aux gourganes, a puree of fava beans coated with cream and browned; cipaille, a casserole of game en croute; and grandperes, dumplings poached in maple syrup. For Nonskiers Armand Bombardier, a Quebecer, gave the world a brand-new sport in 1936 with his snowmobile, first used by a priest traveling a rural parish. Ste. Agathe's Club Moto-Neige, founded in 1963, was the world's first and today 2,000 miles of trails link Laurentian towns and connect with routes to Quebec City, 240 miles, or two days, away. Jean-Guy Page in St. Adolphe d'Howard (819-327-2433) organizes treks by the hour, day or week. The cost is $50 a day or $210 for six days for a one-person Bombardier Safari 377, including head-to-toe outergear, map and trail pass.\nArtificial snow and night lights guarantee a long run on Mont Olympia's new 1,600-foot toboggan hill in Piedmont. A pass for the T-bar ride up is $6 for a single, $8 for a double toboggan (514-227-3523). Apres Ski More than 900 people pay $3.50 on weekends to jostle, drink and dance to live bands at Bourbon Street in Hotel La Louisiane on Route 117 near Mont Rolland. The place to be seen in St. Sauveur as the lifts close, whether you've skied or not, is Bar 70 in the distinctive Pavilion 70 base lodge. The Express is Mont Tremblant Lodge's new swanky late-night dance club. A grown-up group gathers in the afternoon at the cozy bar of Cuttles Mont Tremblant Club, where a hot buttered rum is $2.70. Canadiana George Kelegher maintains warehouses of antique pine furniture and Canadiana to stock his busy shop, Le Coq Rouge, which has been in St. Jovite for 25 years.\nItems such as sap buckets, washstands and decoys - used by Quebec's habitants (settlers) and coureurs de bois (woodsmen and fur traders) - start at $25.
972	A LEGENDARY FISH FROM GALILEE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DF143EF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: A barren, arid wasteland extends up from the Dead Sea along the Jordan River, in the northern end of the Great Rift Valley that stretches up from Kenya to Syria; it is hard to understand how it could be part of the Fertile Crescent. The river is narrow here and has virtually disappeared with the drought of the past few years.\nA barren, arid wasteland extends up from the Dead Sea along the Jordan River, in the northern end of the Great Rift Valley that stretches up from Kenya to Syria; it is hard to understand how it could be part of the Fertile Crescent. The river is narrow here and has virtually disappeared with the drought of the past few years. The heat is so oppressive and the landscape so bleak that one wonders why the Children of Israel chose to settle here and indeed, why it has been the site of confrontation for thousands of years. Until, that is, you enter the Galilee. This is the region most prominent in the Gospels, where the Sea of Galilee and the villages around it are mentioned frequently and from whose fishermen came Jesus' disciples. This is also where the capital of Judaism was established in the first century, after the burning of Jerusalem. Here, the sands give way to the rolling hills from which the area takes it name. They are covered with olive groves, fruit orchards, banana plantations and plentiful, lush vegetation. The climate becomes gentle and the Jordan reappears, flowing out of the southern end of the Sea of Galilee in a wide, meandering stream. In this lovely setting, at Kibbutz Kinneret, there is a baptism site, Yardenit, which is free to visitors.\nThe sea is really a freshwater lake, harp-shaped and called Kinneret from the Hebrew word for stringed instrument. Josephus called it the Sea of Gennesar, because the plain of Gennesaret is just to the west; the ancient rabbis noted that the Lord created seven seas but the Sea of Gennesaret is His delight. It's also known as Lake Tiberias, after the town that Herod Antipas built on its shore and named in honor of Emperor Tiberius. In Arabic, it is still Bahret Tabariya.\nThe lake lies 680 feet below sea level, is roughly half as wide as its 14-mile length and still, as in biblical times, supports a lively fishing industry. It teems with bourri (gray mullet), sardines, carp, perch and a kind of fish, called tilapia, that is better known as St. Peter's fish.\nThis bony little denizen of the not-so-deep is said to have been the fish in whose mouth St. Peter found the shekel with which to pay his taxes. Today, it is still supplying shekels, not only to the fishermen of the lake but also to a whole industry that has grown around it. Fish farms cover more than 50,000 acres in the valleys. Tilapia hatchlings are collected and raised in the farm ponds.\nAlthough St. Peter's fish is available throughout Israel, it is at the lakeside restaurants in Tiberias that it seems to taste best. Perhaps it's that the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes is said to have taken place at Tabigha nearby, perhaps it's the glorious setting with the Golan Heights rising across the waters, perhaps it's the alfresco dining. Ein Gev, the kibbutz directly opposite on the eastern shore, is probably the most widely known eating place of the area, but Tayalet Tiberias, the Promenade, is the most delightful.\nStroll along the north end, under the big Israeli ficus and mimosa trees and look at the menus (they are written both in English and Hebrew) posted by Nof Kineret (Kinneret View), Cafe Hayam Eli (Eli's Cafe on the Sea) and Galei Gil (Waves of Joy); they are nearly identical, as are the prices. (Caramba, the dairy restaurant, doesn't serve fish.) Choose a table right on the water so you can toss some pita to the sardines, which will roil the water like piranha in a feeding frenzy, and order your meal.\nTypically, a meal at an Israeli restaurant begins with Oriental salads. In this country, Oriental means Middle Eastern, which includes Turkish and Greek with Moroccan, Syrian and Arabic. Many restaurants simply set an assortment in front of you and they are included in the price of the main course; at the Promenade restaurants, they are not. You can order them individually but it's best to ask for the plate of salads. A multitude of little dishes will be brought, along with a platter heaped with small, hot pitas, the round, hollow Arab bread. Tear off a piece and use it as a scoop for the hummus, a paste of ground chickpeas and spices, and tahini, a sauce of ground sesame seeds with a puddle of olive oil in the middle. Most of the salads are made with olive oil, lemon juice or vinegar, garlic and parsley and, except for eggplant salad, which can be one of a variety, the main ingredients stay the same from place to place.\nNow for the St. Peter's fish. You can order it grilled or fried (Galei Gil also does a sauce) and grilled is recommended, especially if you like crisp skin. The fish is very low in fat (1.5 to 3 percent) and high in protein (18 to 20 percent), has a white flesh that is so mild that even fish-haters love it and weighs about one pound soaking wet. It comes to the table on a bed of shredded lettuce, whole with head, fins and tail, and accompanied by very good french fries and a green salad. It's largely bone; start at the head and eat toward the tail. There's not much flesh, but as Spencer Tracy once said in another context, ''What there is, is cherce.'' The fish that is exported to the United States and elsewhere come from the larger farm fish and is available in fillets of about four and a half ounces each. They can be used in any recipe calling for a mild, white fish. The restaurants use some fish from the lake but most of theirs, too, come from the farms. With the meal, try the sweet, black Israeli beer.\nSweet-tasting food and drink, in fact, seem to be an Israeli passion. The desserts are creams and pastries, with the Oriental (again, read Middle Eastern) pastries heavy on the honey. There are strawberries and melon in season. Turkish coffee, which is boiled, thick and strong, is also sweet. A meal for four will cost about $60. Galei Gil is open from 8 A.M. to midnight, Nof Kineret from 9 A.M. to midnight, and Cafe Hayam Eli from 9 A.M. to 2 A.M. All are open every day except Yom ha-Shoa (Holocaust Day), which falls on April 26 this year, and Yom Kippur, which is on Oct. 3.\nTiberias is a superlative base for sightseeing and relaxing, with several deluxe hotels. The town's hot springs have been an attraction since antiquity.\nGetting There Tiberias is about a three-hour drive from Tel Aviv going via Haifa. It takes as long from Jerusalem, traveling via Jericho.\nWhere to Stay Tiberias is a resort city and has camping sites and hostels as well as hotels and spas. The hot springs south of the city (Hammat Tiberias) are 140 degrees and have been in use since biblical times.\nThe Tiberias Plaza (92233) is a luxurious hotel right on the lake; prices in high season (Dec. 19 to Jan. 4, April 20 to May 4, Oct. 3 to 6 and 17 to 26) are $90 to $120 for two, in low season (June 1 to July 16 and Nov. 16 to March 1), $80 to $95 and $80 to $110 for the rest of the year.\nGalei Kinneret (92331), also on the lake, is $87 to $107 in high season, $65 to $85 in low season and $75 to $85 at other times.\nGanai Hamat (92890) is a little over a mile out of town on the lake road, offering its own beach and special rates at the Tiberias Hot Springs spa next to it. In high season, a double costs $90, in low season, $46; regular rates are $54. All the above rates include breakfast but do not include a 15 percent service charge.\nTravelers would be wise to verify rates upon booking as they change frequently.\nTours The Kinneret Sailing Company has a daily, year-round service from the Promenade to Ein Gev, with additional trips in the summer.\nThere is an excellent guided walking tour every Wednesday, leaving from the Tiberias Plaza Hotel.\nEgged Tours (20474) and Galilee Tours (20330) run daily sightseeing trips by bus.\nFor more information, contact the Israeli Government Tourist Office, 350 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10118 (212-560-0650) or the Tourist Information Office, 8 Elhadeff Street, Tiberias, Israel (20992).E.

973	UNHURRIED KARIBA	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DF143EF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The lion was suddenly there, fixed and big and tawny in the headlights.\nThe lion was suddenly there, fixed and big and tawny in the headlights.\nFor a split second it paused, framed by the pale, brittle grass of the bushlands, its hard young eyes frozen in the glare. There was an intimacy in our encounter, tinged with excitement and fear. This was not, after all, some organized safari through the bushlands, but a sighting on the main tarred highway between Karoi and Makuti, before the road tumbles over the Zambezi escarpment on a route that could be traced from the Cape halfway to Cairo.\nThe traveler had not gone looking for lion, but the lion had nonetheless appeared, a whiff of wildness without mercy, on the tarred road that men had laid down to assert a frail mastery over these lands, a dominance challenged by the apparition.\nAfter the brief moment, it was gone, hunting perhaps, on some foul mission, for there were people living not far from the highway, people in huts, with chickens and children and goats all about them, aware always of the sly footfall in the dark betraying an imminent pounce.\nFor six years, sometimes frequently, sometimes fitfully, I have traveled the road from Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, to the lake at Kariba and its islands. But there had been a gap of two years since the last time, and I was returning to keep a long-delayed tryst without the certainty that things had not changed in my absence. So the lion bore a promise that things were not so different after all, and that soon I would be encased in a world where its paramountcy was acknowledged and treasured, and where humans tread lightly in a wilderness, ironically, of their own making.\nSometime in the 50's, Africa's erstwhile colonial rulers, with the audacity of overlords in an alien land, thought of building a dam that would stem the Zambezi River and flood its valley for 175 miles downstream of the Victoria Falls, creating both a new source of hydroelectric power and a stark, new beauty at the continent's heart.\nAnd so, after wranglings and doubts, they went ahead and did it, and the valley began to fill in the 60's, turning hilltops into islands, sending tens of thousands of Batonga tribespeople to higher ground and trapping game and birds too weak to flee the valley.\nThe animals were rescued by Operation Noah, as it was named by the conservationists who mounted it, and brought to safety in a new reserve created for them, called Matusadona. Then, in the early 70's, regardless of a bush war just beginning, and long ended now, people began to build wilderness retreats on the new islands formed by the manmade lake at Kariba. These camps, at Spurwing and Fothergill islands, marked the end of my 230-mile journey from Harare.\nAs I drove down the last, snaking stretch to Kariba, I wondered if the islands had changed. After all, no place, no continent, is immutable; human pressures build and erode the wild; people poach or are careless or grow tired of the effort to conserve and move on, leaving their creations to crumble.\nWhen traveling, the voyager sometimes seeks auguries; I chose the balding spare tire that was already in use due to a puncture earlier on. If it goes flat before Kariba, say, other things will go wrong; if it holds up, then the journey will be worthwhile.\nThe spare held, and dawn the next day redeemed the lion's promise. The lake stretched in the hard light, across to the mountains and the Sanyati Gorge that slices through them, and to the islands, places laden with memories of earlier trips - the cold lunches on days almost too hot for breathing; the squalls that hammered at my powerboat; the fish that were lost and the friends who had departed, and most of all, the peace of total isolation, on an island where first light arrives through slatted blinds, painting bars of gold on the mosquito netting.\nFor what is a safari all about if not to be alone, cut off from the cities and the highways and the noise and dirt? And what can offer greater isolation than an island, a dot on a chart showing wild, uninhabited lands to one side and 18 miles of water to the other, a divide from the lights of the mainland that sets the mind to an unhurried rhythm?\nYou still approach Spurwing and Fothergill by water, nudging between the spectral, petrified tree stumps that survived the filling of the lake and still stretch upward in crazy, anguished shapes - here, a hand imploring from the deep; there, two stately trunks that lean toward each other, a ceremonial archway never to be completed. And still, before a drumbeat announces that dinner is served, when people recount their day to others, there is much talk of boats and water and fish so big that only a thwarted angler could even conceive their magnitude.\nBut, these last four years, the rains, as elsewhere in Africa, have been capricious, failing totally sometimes and bringing drought, or blessing some places while leaving others to thirst. The water of the lake is low and there are oddities. A red channel marker at Fothergill, for instance, is left high and dry, a marooned sentry far from water; on the mainland, at Kariba, the marina gasoline station that used to float is beached, and a harbor is overgrown with grass. Worse still, the tree stumps, exposed now in the lake, have become harsh fangs that could pierce a hull; they appear in places on the water where years ago I had pushed the throttle of my boat forward to head for new fishing ground.\nThe islands have become temporary peninsulas, connected to the mainland game reserve by land suddenly bared, awaiting the rains from the north, in the Zambezi catchment area, that will restore their status. Not this year, so the wisdom runs, for it is too late and the rains have ended; but maybe next year, or the next. The continent does not provide a ready answer, beyond the faith that its capriciousness will bring good after bad, as it sometimes does.\nYet when the dawn spills over the harbor, in front of the thatched lodge that is my temporary home, or at Africa's quick sunset, far across the lake in another country, there seems no tie to the mainland. The mood is still an island mood, and the water remains the custodian of solitude and escape.\nBut to do? What is there to do? Rob Macdonald, the manager at Spurwing, says they ask this, the overseas visitors in particular, not yet attuned to the pace, Americans especially, wanting a neat package of game sightings and comforts and then departure.\nWell, it can be done, and it is done. There are motorized safaris from both islands, and game walks in elephant country, led by Rob Fynn, the owner of Fothergill, who is a professional guide and carries a rifle. And there are boat trips close to the shore where buffaloes and elephants graze in the lush grass that has regenerated on the land left bare by the falling waters. There are bucks and lions and birds, storks and goliath herons, fish eagles that beckon the trees to rise from the water with their haunting call. But in this small world, encased by bushland and water, there is, most of all, peace - the mainland and the tarred roads and the hotels with discos and casinos are far distant, and on the water, in the heat, where you are idly fishing or watching the elephants at their leisurely defoliation, no one can intrude.\nThe day begins, ideally, at dawn, before breakfast is served for the late sleepers who defy the sunlight turning the dark thatch to a mellowed ocher. Then, in October, say, the peak fishing season, to head out early across the water toward the Sanyati Gorge is to seek the promise fulfilled. The lake, as we used to joke on those rough days when the chop seared over the bows, can be a cruel mistress. The wind can come up from nowhere, and churn the water so, that the circumspect will busy themselves with trivial tasks in the harbor, like polishing the chrome around the bows, while the impatient go fishing.\nBut this time it is calmer, and the tigerfish, Hydrocynus vittatus, or striped water dog, bite ferociously for a morning, turning suddenly sated by 11 A.M. as the heat builds. We have tied up in a clump of trees, a spot chosen by the guide, a man called Champion, the skipper of the hired, 18-foot powerboat. Champion seems normally taciturn, catching his share of fish using a bait of freshwater sardines, known locally as kapenta, while the visitor tries a fly rod with less success. But his eyes scan water and land in quest of signs that at first eluded me.\n''Baboon,'' Champion says, pointing to a patch of the mainland. The visitor, at first, sees nothing - then they arrive, a family of baboons shambling past a herd of bucks.\n''Buffalo, see. There.'' He points again as the broad, black back of a buffalo rises above the grass of a lake shore that, when I first visited here, had been covered by water. A hundred yards away, amid the stumps, the water swirls suddenly, and the pink-gray head that rises from the water, snuffling, needs no introduction: hippo, about four of them, surfacing and sinking to their own rhythm, distant and harmless. But then, as the heat grows toward noon and we cruise the fishing spots, Champion espies another sight - a baby hippopotamus, vulnerable, close by the bank, only the top of its head showing clear of the water. Champion edges closer, and the mother surfaces, snorting and angry at the intrusion. Still the boat moves closer until we are a bare 10 yards from mother and calf.\n''Back off, Champion,'' I say, instantly regretting the uncertainty, the fear, that forced the command. Later, telling the story to Rob Macdonald at Spurwing, he agrees: Don't get too close to a nursing hippo, it's not worth it, he says, without needing to add that she'll overturn the boat and close those huge jaws on whatever flails in the water, and if the hippo doesn't get you, the crocs probably will.\nThat caution is typical of those in charge at Fothergill and Spurwing, and reassuring. There have been accidents because people don't accept the wildness of wild animals and become blase, strolling unaccompanied out of camp, or acting cavalier about the buffalo that stray into camp. Not too long ago, they say, Rob Fynn had to shoot an elephant that charged a party on a walking safari.\nWe can go close to elephants in the Land-Rovers for photographs, says Frik Maas, Fothergill's manager, but only because we know each herd personally and have a chance to second-guess their behavior. Out on the lake, while viewing game by boat, you can get close to the elephants, too, approaching the shore as they feed, no threat to them. Six years ago, business was not as good on the islands as it is now, and the traveler could simply arrive for lunch and find, probably, that there would be accommodation, too. That has changed. In Harare, I was told that both Fothergill and Spurwing were fully booked for the weekend. Fortunately, there had been a cancellation, so I was given a lodge of thatch with a shower and toilet and mosquito nets over comfortable beds and a view over the grasslands that used to be covered by water. If the rains are good for a couple of years, they reckon, the lake will again be at the doorstep of the lodges, filling the night with its lap and wash.\nAt evening, this time, as the sky turned a special kind of orange-mauve, I stood on a track near the camp, near the huge cables strung between the trees to keep elephants away, and watched Africa's rapid gloaming, a visible descent of a huge, glaring sun, timed in seconds as it fell below the hills of Zambia on the other side of the lake. Reinforced in isolation by the water, I strolled back, knowing that soon the lake would be dotted with the pinprick lights of the kapenta rigs, fishing with nets that resemble pelican jaws, lowered beneath a spotlight at each of their sterns. Then, I thought, a supper and an early bed, and at dawn the following day I would be back on the lake. There would be no urgency, and the fish would bite, and I'd release the small fry and leave the bigger ones for Champion to take home to the myriad pots of the mainland.\nIn the bar, I eavesdropped on a conversation between an American couple and an English couple; they were bemoaning the fact that, the next day, their program had a two-hour gap in it, and how could you come all this way and waste time like that? They hadn't, I thought, got the hang of it, not yet. If you go\nThe Road to the Islands Kariba can be reached either by road or by air. A medium-size sedan can be hired in Harare for about $35 a day plus about 70 cents a mile. The drive takes about four hours, and the last 30 miles from Makuti to Kariba run through a wildlife reserve. The transfer by boat from the mainland to either island costs about $40 a person, round trip.\nThe scheduled flight on Air Zimbabwe from Harare to Kariba is about $75 round trip; the airstrip is on Fothergill Island.\nBed and Board Accommodations on Fothergill Island, with all meals, range from about $35 to $45 a person a night, plus $37.50 a day if the visitor wants a full program of organized safaris. Boat hire, with fuel and driver in a reliable 18-footer, works out to a little over $75 a day.\nAccommodations on Spurwing range from tents set on concrete slabs for about $35 a person a night to cabins with private toilets and showers for about $50. Game-viewing drives and water cruises cost about $15 a person; boat hire fees range from about $18 a day for a canoe to about $65 (plus fuel) for a launch with an outboard engine.\nBookings for either Fothergill or Spurwing may be made through Abercrombie & Kent, 1420 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, Ill. 60521 (telephone: 312-954-2944 or 800-323-7308), or through agents in Harare. Package rates are also available.\nLooking at Animals Game viewing is best done during the African winter, from May to August, when temperatures are in the 70's and 80's, the grass is low and the animals gravitate toward the waters of the lake. Visitors should come armed with antimalaria medication (cerebral malaria is the main risk, and no one takes it lightly), insect repellent and long-sleeved shirts for protection against both the sun and mosquitoes. A hat is essential. Film should be bought in advance.\nTiger and Other Fishing For anglers, October is the best month for tigerfish, but temperatures can soar into the 90's and above. Take along a good sunscreen - but get someone else to apply it. Experts suggest that tigerfish are put off by any taint of sun lotion on bait or lures.\nBait can be bought on the islands, and tackle is generally available at Angler's Corner, Baker Avenue, Harare. Bright red and silvery Mepps lures, with a large single hook, catch tigerfish, as do gaudy bass streamers in red, black, white and silver (the bigger the better). Wire leader is essential since tigerfish have sharp teeth, and a hook sharpener should be included in the gear because tigerfish have a hard mouth and setting the hook can be difficult. The record tigerfish for the lake is about 34 pounds.\nThere is also good fishing for freshwater bream and a variety of other species, including a local catfish known as vundu. Smaller hooks and worm bait are used for bream. Vundu eat just about anything (including, it is said, carbolic soap) and night fishing for them usually involves heavy line, big hooks and some effort: the Zimbabwean record for a vundu, caught in the Zambezi in 1981, is more than 100 pounds.

974	ZURICH'S HAVEN OF GENIUS AND JOVIALITY	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDF143EF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: I am at home in few places In the house over the lake On the other side of the moon On the stage of the theater Surrounded by side scenes And in the Kronenhalle In Mother Zumsteg's empire The liver-dumpling soup steams . . . - From ''Kronenhalle'' by Friedrich Durrenmatt\nI am at home in few places In the house over the lake On the other side of the moon On the stage of the theater Surrounded by side scenes And in the Kronenhalle In Mother Zumsteg's empire The liver-dumpling soup steams . . . - From ''Kronenhalle'' by Friedrich Durrenmatt\nSwitzerland's Friedrich Durrenmatt, known for his plays of ambiguous message, is not so abstruse when it comes to his stomach. He favors liver-dumpling soup at the Kronenhalle in Zurich, where he settles in by the window, sometimes with Federico Fellini. They are part of a fitting tradition: The restaurant has been a surrogate home to a century of genius.\nHulda Zumsteg, its proprietress, who died two years ago at age 94, was fond of recalling old friends and patrons - Richard Strauss, Igor Stravinsky, Bertolt Brecht, Cristobal Balenciaga. Thomas Mann liked the red room - it reminded him of a German luxury ship. Braque and Miro sat around the tables, and they hang on the walls; Picasso, too. But the most devoted habitue, the one whose regular seat everyone asks to see, if not sit in, was James Joyce. ''Joyce lived here for eight years,'' says Gustav Zumsteg, Hulda's son and the Kronenhalle's owner. ''He came here every day. And he left this place to die.''\nJoyce liked Wiener schnitzel and goulash, smoked cigars and stared up into the corner, then went home to work on ''Finnegans Wake.'' Hulda Zumsteg was his dear friend. And he treated young Gustav as his own son, told him fairy tales, talked about birds and the beauty of life, gave him the pen he used to write ''Finnegans Wake.'' It was the restaurant's warmth and sparkle that attracted Joyce. ''The door,'' he said, ''locked out all the disappointment.''\nMother Zumsteg is dead, as are many old friends, but the Kronenhalle, alive with their heirs, endures as a pantheon. These days Durrenmatt can bump into Yves Saint Laurent, Catherine Deneuve, Placido Domingo, who join a bustle of Zurichers and foreigners, carpenters, shippers, princes and playboys and ordinary people. Zurich hotel concierges name the Kronenhalle their most frequently requested restaurant reservation. Its appeal? The food: simple, Swiss, classic. The atmosphere: hospitable, jovial. The art, the celebrities, the legend. ''This is one of the few places where one can still dream,'' explains Mr. Zumsteg.\nThe legend began with Hulda Zumsteg, an institution inseparable from the one she made. A poor shoemaker's daughter, she left the provinces at age 18 to find work in the city, first as a servant, then as a waitress. Possessed with vision and a will for hard work, she came to conquer that city, became its doyenne. Balenciaga dressed her; Miro painted birthday greetings to her; Willie Varlin, the Swiss portraitist, painted her. Her portrait, which you can't miss in the Kronenhalle, is reproduced in ''Zurich: Metropolis on the Limmat,'' a pictorial biography, on a page devoted to Varlin's prominent Zurichers. When she died, Zurich saw something like a state funeral. ''It was like one for a queen,'' recalls the first head waiter, Johann Kloimstein.\nHulda married a restaurateur, Gottlieb Zumsteg, saved every franc and bought an established but run-down Kronenhalle in 1921. She insisted on the finest linen, crockery, cutlery and cuisine. This Zumsteg philosophy has not changed, nor have some original recipes, passed down from chef to chef as a matter of policy. The first chef and cook specialized in regional dishes - boiled meat, red cabbage, noodles and soup. When a French chef was recruited, the Kronenhalle menu -and fame - became international. Today the original regional dishes are served on the trolley, a 50-year-old Kronenhalle custom that offers a daily lunch and dinner for about $21. Friday lunch is smoked pork with lentils; Wednesday and Saturday, bollito misto (boiled beef, sausage, chicken, tongue), tete de veau (head of veal) and marrow cooked in bouillon with cabbage, leeks and celery. Other days the trolley fare differs - a glazed calf breast for lunch, roast lamb for dinner -according to the season and market.\nMrs. Zumsteg also inspired the restaurant's welcoming atmosphere, appearing every evening to greet every guest. Today the family warmth is extended by her son, her granddaughter, Vreny Gerhartz, who helps Mr. Zumsteg, and a staff known for its longevity. Mr. Zumsteg calls the Kronenhalle his hobby - in ''real life'' he owns Abraham Silk, which makes fabrics for, among others, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Valentino. But he has managed the restaurant for 29 years, lives upstairs, and is intent on maintaining its traditions and character. When he renovated the premises between 1981 and 1985 he made sure everything looked exactly the same.\nAccording to Mr. Zumsteg, he persuaded his mother to open the Kronenhalle Bar, in 1965, to keep the restaurant accessible to the young and ''unmoneyed.'' And it is often crowded at night with a cross-section of Zurich. ''The important people,'' he says, ''have simple tastes.'' As for new trends in food, he acknowledges their contribution, but not on his menu. ''Personally I am for the great tradition of cooking, and our cooking is based on that tradition. You will never get nouvelle cuisine here.''\nMr. Zumsteg has added his own touches. Hanging on the Kronenhalle's walls, as casually as a bunch of $10 prints, are Klees and Kandinskys, Braques and Bonnards, a Cezanne, a Monet. Art is his passion. He has counted great artists among his friends, collected their works since he was a young man. The restaurant's paintings are the overflow from his homes in Zurich and Paris.\nThe Kronenhalle, which means hall of crowns, is in a five-story, gray, Biedermeier building, Zurich solid-discreet. The address is 4 Ramistrasse (telephone, 251 02 56). It could be a shuttered town house or bank but for six gold crowns above six first-floor windows and two pre-Zumsteg lanterns hanging by chains from gold-crowned bronze heads.\nThere are three dining rooms. The brasserie or traditional hall, for 80, is the center of the Kronenhalle, buzzing and historic. A masculine room of dark wood-paneled walls and wood floors, coat racks and tufted green leather benches with buttons, old chandeliers, tall Diffenbachia plants, it distills the restaurant's German Swiss past. Emblems of Zurich's medieval guilds border the walls above black wooden signs for Tuborg and Lowenbrau Munchen. Posters announce the Opernhaus and Schauspielhaus seasons. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung and Der Bund hang from newspaper racks. Mrs. Zumsteg by Varlin - a magnificent figure with upswept hair, designer dress, dragon bracelet by Benvenuto Cellini - peers out on her legacy.\nThe adjacent Chagall room, Mann's favorite, is dominated by the artist's ''Glaieuls,'' bright red and white gladioluses against vivid blue. More private, it seats 55 in an old-Europe aura of rich stained-glass windows, Persian carpets and red: pleated lampshades, leather chairs, thick velvet curtains. The upstairs room, for 60, is more formal and clublike, with dinner taken amid noiseless thick carpets, white cafe curtains and dark wood. Note the playful Miro, ''Pour Maman Hulda Zumsteg.''\nFor a table in the brasserie, reservations should be made at least two days ahead. In the Chagall and upstairs rooms, reservations can be made the same day. The Kronenhalle serves coffee and snacks as well as lunch and dinner and changes in mood from mellow to madhouse. Four to six is the quietest time, when patrons relax over coffee served on informal green and white cloths, and writers sit down to write. Saturday lunch is prolonged, the guest book whipped out for Roman Polanski or Claude Terrail, visiting from his three-star Tour d'Argent in Paris. Busiest nights are Tuesdays and Fridays. On a typical Friday the bar is packed out by 6. (The bar is open daily from 11:30 A.M. to midnight, the restaurant from noon to midnight.) Ears are near-deafened by the chatter in German, Italian, French. Diego Giacometti's bronze, owl-shaped lamps, Athenian symbols of wisdom and night, light up a crush of people - the collegians in Fair Isle and denim, artists in black leather, pillars of Zurich society in beige mink - standing sardine-style or seated on green leather couches around rust marble tables (bronze feet by Giacometti). The chief bartender, Peter Roth, is concocting one of his prize-winning drinks. The Ladykiller ($7), with Gordon's gin, Cointreau, apricot brandy and passion-fruit and pineapple juice, garnished with a rose-shaped orange peel and a green maraschino, is his most famous. Drinks are served with salted almonds, paprika potato chips and Bundnerfleisch ($13), that Swiss delicacy of smoked, dried, thinly sliced beef.\nThe walk to the brasserie is like the entrance one makes into a good party. There is a buzz. Women wear Chanel, real jewels, mink headbands, khaki; men wear loud ties, black tie, old school ties, no ties. Some have brought their babies and dogs. The room is also dressed up: two giant bouquets, birds of paradise or red Hawaiian anthurium, flank the Zumsteg family table.\nDinner is served on white linen, blue and white English china, and eaten with silver. Waiters wear white jackets, black ties; waitresses, black dresses, embroidered white aprons. The choice of cuisine is simple or classic, beef goulash with dumplings or trout with white wine. There is an a la carte menu (with an English translation) and a plats du jour menu. Meals are eaten with Burli, a slightly sour peasant bread. Most traditional dishes are served with golden Rosti - boiled, diced, fried, then baked, potatoes, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, the national dish of German Switzerland.\nA good Swiss meal might start with veal sausage salad ($10) and bouillon with pancake and marrow ($4.50), go on with veal steak, cream sauce, morels and noodles ($25) or shredded calf's liver and Rosti ($22) and end with Zuger Kirschtorte ($3.50). Aigle ($25 the bottle) and Dezaley ($32) are first-class Swiss white wines from the Vaud canton, very dry, round in the bouquet, a hint of a bubble. Dole des Monts ($20) is a dry red from Valais, comparable to a pleasant, light Burgundy. The Reserve de la Patronne is a red burgundy ($14 a carafe).\nAn international alternative: blinis with smoked salmon and caviar ($19), oxtail soup with sherry ($5), grilled turbot with English potatoes ($28) or young chicken with rosemary, risotto and bolets ($23). For dessert: grapefruit sorbet with vodka ($6) or fruit salad ($6) that comes with kiwi, passion fruit, papaya, mangoes, strawberries and pineapple.\nAs dinner starts, Irma, a Kronenhalle waitress for 10 years, wishes a hearty ''Bon appetit.'' When plates are depleted she inquires, ''Fini?'' -then serves a full second portion on fresh plates. In the meantime, the mood has revved up. Nino the clown walks in selling flowers. The Salvation Army pays its Friday night visit, sings ''Lass den Sonnenschein Herein,'' plays the guitar, hands out its newspaper. Dogs bark and babies clap hands. ''Clowns, hymns, dogs, babies, cats,'' says Mr. Kloimstein, the head waiter. ''everything is here.''
975	BEHEMOTH ON THE PRAIRIE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DE143EF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Snow whistles across the icy highway in Edmonton, Alberta, 350 miles north of the Canada-United States border. The temperature is 20 degrees below zero. As the airport taxi skates across the road, the driver says, ''You'd better enjoy this weather. This is a heat wave here. Things can only get worse.\nSnow whistles across the icy highway in Edmonton, Alberta, 350 miles north of the Canada-United States border. The temperature is 20 degrees below zero. As the airport taxi skates across the road, the driver says, ''You'd better enjoy this weather. This is a heat wave here. Things can only get worse.''\nMaybe not. A giant, ice-framed billboard proclaims our destination: the Fantasyland Hotel. The sign features a bevy of blondes reclining and eating grapes in decidedly un-frigid surroundings. The hotel opened in October and is the latest jewel in the crown of the West Edmonton Mall, by far the world's largest shopping center.\nThe mall, covering 110 acres and on two levels, includes a copy of the Versailles fountains, a re-creation of New Orleans's Bourbon Street, a miniature golf course modeled on Pebble Beach and an indoor amusement park, Canada Fantasyland, whose name, scale and style strongly suggest Disney. There are a half-dozen cuddly-looking tiger, lion and bear cubs, Wayne Gretzky, the hockey superstar, and teammates practicing slap shots and a five-acre wave pool that will be used for surfing championships next spring.\nOh yes, and there are 836 stores selling everything from diamonds and dog food to dining-room sets. Best of all, in these frosty environs, everything is indoors: You can lean against a palm, sip a lemonade and smile at the snow piled on the glass roof.\nContrary to predictions of some experts, the $750 million mall has become a major tourist attraction, drawing an average of 400,000 people a week, two-thirds of them from out of town. The first phase opened in 1981 and second and third phases were added in 1983 and 1985. ''I swear we have built a permanent Expo in Edmonton,'' says Bahman Ghermezian, the youngest of the four brothers who own the mall, referring to last summer's successful Expo 86 in Vancouver.\nThe success is such that a similar mall, to be named the Mall of America, is to be built in Bloomington, a suburb of Minneapolis. Ground-breaking for what may turn out to be twice as big a monument to mass marketing is set for next May. Plans call for a reproduction of Piccadilly Circus and the canals of Venice (with singing gondoliers) as well as both the elegant Right Bank and bohemian Left Bank in Paris. The Ghermezians are also involved in negotiations with New York State and the Province of Ontario over which will provide more government help to build an even larger mall. Governor Cuomo has promised $400 million in tax and other concessions for a megamall at Niagara Falls.\n''It is the best thing that could happen to any city in the world,'' says Nader Ghermezian, the second brother, of the third mall project. ''It will be the largest, most comprehensive tourist attraction ever built.''\nOn the way to the West Edmonton Mall, half an hour after passing that enticing billboard, our cab is sliding to a stop in front of the ice-draped Fantasyland Hotel. The door is opened smartly by a tall man in a scarlet and blue Mountie uniform, made taller still by his Dudley Doright hat. Inside, the doorman hands the bags to bellmen wearing sandals and skimpy Roman togas. Checking in, one notices the smiling receptionists, all women and all wearing equally skimpy Hawaiian-style attire with pink leis around their tanned necks.\nThe choice of rooms they suggest ranges from Polynesian suites where guests lie on water beds modeled after warrior catamarans under full sail to Roman rooms with white marble sculpture and columns and what is termed an authentic Roman bath. Among the 120 theme rooms - of the 360 in the hotel - are some in Hollywood style with 1950's neon, a black-tile bath and an enormous video screen. It is difficult to decide which room to select. All have enormous Jacuzzi baths, an array of mirrors on the walls and ceilings and bars stocked with caviar and champagne. I chose the Truck Room, with the bed fashioned from the back of a real Chevrolet pickup. On one wall hung a giant Stop sign, on the opposite a Yield sign, and in the corner stood a tall Shell gas pump with the price labeled at 29 cents a gallon. The yellow line stretching out across the blacktop carpet bespoke journeys and horizons and lonely adventure while a lifesize policeman glistening in the always changing traffic light stared into the sunken Jaccuzi.\nRooms like this are perhaps hard to leave. This is true even for children, who make up about half the guests. (All sofas can be unfolded into beds, and youngsters can sleep in various unconventional places, including the cab of the pickup.) But the mall beckons.\nOne of the first establishments the visitor encounters on stepping from the lobby of the hotel into the shopping mall is a Bank of America branch changing money for Americans. About a third of the mall's visitors are Americans, and since the Canadian dollar is worth less than their own they pay about 72 cents for a Canadian dollar.\nJust around the corner is an 80-foot-long Spanish galleon, a copy of Columbus's Santa Maria, floating in a tree-lined, indoor lagoon. It is this mix of the unexpected and expected that most characterizes the West Edmonton Mall. A few steps along, for example, is a 650-year-old, hand-carved pagoda, eight feet tall, in front of a lingerie shop. The visitor can walk a half-mile on one level of the building and a half-mile back on the other. Wheelchairs can be rented for $3.50 a day, strollers for $3 and motorized scooters, with shopping baskets, for $2 for the first hour and $1.50 for each additional. (Prices have been converted to United States dollars.) On Europa Boulevard, Cartier, Ralph Lauren, Saint Laurent and Courreges all display their wares. Canadian Tire, for your hardware needs, overlooks it all. If you emerge into the mall from the second floor of the hotel, you can buy a luxury car across from the adjoining chapel in which shoppers may pray, marry or, using a mall credit card, arrange a funeral.\nThere is plenty to eat as well as buy. Gumbo and jambalaya are served at the Cafe Orleans on Bourbon Street, hamburgers at Fudricker's across the street. Offerings in the 35-store Gourmet Court, a palace of fast food, include a 70-cent Japanese shish kebab at Shogun, a $3.50 calamari (squid) dinner at Aesop's Table and a 75-cent portion of french fries at the Fresh Fry Company. In all, there are 110 places to eat, including 3 McDonald's.\nAmong many places to buy a drink is the Sherlock Holmes Restaurant and Pub where more than 100 regulars maintain personal mugs - ''No. 9, please.'' At Puck's, you can quaff a margarita beneath more pictures of Wayne Gretzky than you dreamed existed.\nOf other diversions, the newest is the World Waterpark where thousands line up for 22 water slides with such names as Sky Screamer, Cannonball Run and Blue Bullet. An inner-tube slide twists and turns under six waterfalls. Then, when a foghorn sounds, parrots squawk, flamingos rustle and hundreds of shoppers scream, ''Surf's up!'' It is the moment for waves to appear at the far end of the wave pool, spreading and building up to a height of six feet. Scores of people shoot across them on rented air mattresses.\nNear the Waterpark is the submarine ride around the lagoon. It is billed as being better than Disney's because the 24-passenger submarines are real, although one cannot help but notice they run on tracks. Another claim is that the mall owns more submarines -four - than the Canadian Navy, a point that loses its impressiveness when the guide says that two of the Navy's subs have been cannibalized for spare parts for the third, which has not been running too well.\nOn our cruise the submarine passes coral reefs, real and artificial sharks, barracudas and other sea creatures and narrowly escapes the effects of a mock dynamite blast. The worst moment comes when the sub becomes disconnected from the track - a genuine misadventure - and we must wait for a diver to descend 15 feet to reconnect us.\nIn Fantasyland, which the mall describes as the world's biggest indoor amusement park, families wait in often long lines for such rides as an old-fashioned merry-go-round or the terrifying Drop of Doom. But one major ride is temporarily closed: It is the Mindbender, a high-speed corkscrew of a roller coaster, which crashed in June, killing three people and seriously injuring another. The Ghermezian brothers say that they and their families promise to be the first riders when a redesigned Mindbender is allowed to resume after repairs and government scrutiny. An official of the park says permission has been given for it to start running again on March 1.\nBut for many, the best thing about the mall is the mall itself. Malls, William Severini Kowinski argued in his 1985 book, ''The Malling of America,'' are essentially an extension of television for the television generations. ''Watching TV we can be everywhere without being anywhere in particular,'' he wrote. ''And basically, television and the mall are in the same business: entertainment in order to sell products.''\nMost of the ideas for fantasy rooms, exotic animals and other attractions came from the Ghermezian brothers themselves. ''But we do not do business for glory,'' Bahman Ghermezian declares. Rather, he says, this family of emigres from Iran achieved a Canadian variation of the age-old American dream. They arrived with beautiful carpets, turned those into real estate profits and proceeded to develop ever more beautiful projects. If the tastes their mall represents are stalwartly middle class, so what? Most people's are.\nBahman tells of his father, Jacob, now 85, who operated a large bazaar, the shopping center of its time, in Samarkand before the Russian Revolution swept away private property.\nAccording to Bahman, Jacob Ghermezian told his sons when they were young, ''When you grow up, I want you to build the biggest building in the world.'' Now, Jacob rouses friends his own age for hikes in the mall, picking them up in the morning and returning them in late afternoon. ''Sleep isn't good for you,'' he tells them. He carries a pocketful of Fantasyland tickets for children who promise not to smoke.\nSome 15,000 children came to the mall to trick or treat on Halloween, with candy courtesy of the Ghermezians. Valentine's Day in 1988 as well as next Feb. 14 is completely booked at the Fantasyland Hotel. And each month people throw $7,000 of coins into the mall's fountains. The money is passed on to charity.\nOn leaving Edmonton I discovered a minibus to the airport that charges $5. (Taking a cab costs $22.) The driver, stopping at another Ghermezian hotel, offers to buy me a coffee, and with the temperature at 10 degrees below zero and falling the offer is appreciated. ''The nice thing about the mall,'' the driver says, ''is that you can forget what's happening outside.'' An Edmonton checklist\nBuying Selectively At first glance the West Edmonton Mall would seem to something of a bargain. Alberta has no sales tax and for Americans a beneficial exchange rate means they can buy Canadian dollars at roughly 72 cents each. Moreover, there is lots of price-leveling competition: The mall has 55 stores, for example, selling nothing but women's shoes. Americans should be cautious, however, because on purchases totaling more than $400 United States Customs levies duties averaging 10 percent. If the shopper has been north of the border less than 48 hours, the 10 percent is levied on goods worth more than $25.\nThe worst deals are on items made in the United States, which are subject to Canadian import duty. Products from Europe and Asia face duties similar to those imposed by the United States and are generally priced the same as south of the border. Canadian wares are generally the cheapest.\nThe mall is open from Monday to Friday from 10 A.M. to 9 P.M., Saturday, 10 to 6, and Sunday, noon to 6. The mall's information number is 403-444-5200.\nPrice Tags Here are some sample prices: On Europa Boulevard, at Le Papillon, a gold and black skirt and top by the Italian designer Ann Ciona fetches $660; at Henry Singer a man's wool sweater by Ermenegildo Zegna costs about $200 and a Cerruti tie, $43. (All prices have been converted to United States dollars.) At Goodman Maneteau on the upper level, a high-fashion black leather, suede and patent-embossed coat by Linson goes for $715. At Harry Rosen's men's store on the second level, a navy cashmere blazer costs $355, while at the store's women's branch across the way a wool crepe suit by Samuelsohn is $450. At Abercrombie & Fitch, men's safari cloth pants are $98; jacket, $140.\nRides For families who want to try the trampolines, a haunted house and the small amusement rides, baby-sitting - for two-year-olds and up - is available for $1.25 for up to a total of four hours. Of the big attractions, Canada Fantasyland, with a ticket for about $11 for all ages, is the most expensive. But rides can also be paid for individually. The Drop of Doom, for instance, is $1.50. Admission to the World Waterpark is $7.50 and $6 for children, with the price for everyone dropping to $4.60 after 6:30 P.M. Guests at the Fantasyland Hotel can enter both Fantasyland and the Waterpark without charge, but they must pay for other attractions that have fees. The submarine ride is $5.75 and $3.60 for children, the Pebble Beach miniature golf is $3.60 a person and the skating rink charges $1.\nWhere to Linger In addition to many fast-food places, there is a variety of restaurants. Among those on Bourbon Street, where artificial stars flicker above a make-believe New Orleans, the Cafe Orleans serves shrimp creole, jambalaya, red beans and sausage on a combination plate for $5. Dinner for two with wine runs $25 to $29. Across Bourbon Street is the Pacific Fish Company, where fresh California swordfish, thresher shark and Hawaiian mahimahi cost about $11 and dinner for two with wine is around $43. Also on Bourbon Street is Zambelli's, a pizza and steak place where dinner for two with wine is about $20.\nThe City Downtown Edmonton is seven miles from the mall and a $4 round trip by bus. Attractions range from theater of various sorts, particularly the Citadel Theater's companies, to galleries and the domed Provincial Legislature. The many festivals include a couple of big rodeos. For those visiting Edmonton in July when the sun hardly sets, there is Klondike Days, celebrating the city's frontier past as well as its present position as ''Gateway to Canada's Arctic.'' The principal winter festival seems to be Edmonton Oilers hockey games, for which tickets are often available. Call 403-451-8000.\nLodging and Dining The Fantasyland Hotel at the mall (800-661-6454) charges $85 to $125 a night for two for its large theme rooms, which are fully booked on weekends through March. Rooms of the same size without themes but including Jacuzzi baths are about $68; the remaining rooms are around $47. One of the downtown hotels is the Four Seasons (10235 101st Street; 403-428-7111) where double rooms are $94 to $112, with special weekend rates of $54. The Westin (10135 100th Street; 403-426-3636) charges $75 and has weekend rates of $50 to $57. A special $50-a-night package available on Friday, Saturday and Sunday through Jan. 31 includes free parking and free shuttle service to the mall. At the new Ramada Renaissance (10155 105th Street; 403-423-4811), doubles range from $65 to $90, with weekend rates $40 to $47.\nFor dining there is the Four Seasons Room (403-428-7111) at the Four Seasons Hotel.

Porsenna had withdrawn his troops from the Janiculum and evacuated Roman territory.\nTo the Editor: I enjoyed Paul Hofmann's article on the Tiber River (Travel, Dec. 7). Livy in ''The Early History of Rome'' states that Cloelia, an unmarried girl, was a hostage of Lars Porsena held in the Etruscan lines, not far from the Tiber. Porsenna had withdrawn his troops from the Janiculum and evacuated Roman territory. I do not think there is any evidence that he withdrew to Umbria.\nWith a number of other girls, Cloelia eluded the guards, swam across the river under a hail of missiles and brought her company safely to Rome, where they were all restored to their families. Porsenna, furious, sent to Rome to demand Cloelia's return. Soon, his anger gave way to admiration of her more-than-masculine courage. He demanded her and said that the treaty he had made with the Romans would be broken if she were not returned. The Romans sent her back; Porsenna praised her publicly; friendly relations were restored, and the Romans paid tribute to Cloelia's courage, unprecedented in a woman, by an equally unprecedented honor: her statue on horseback on the Via Sacra.\nPerhaps Father Tiber, in its renovation, should be referred to as Mother Tiber, since women were recognized so early by the Romans. RHODA M. SCHALL New York Paul Hofmann replies: Livy is the oldest literary source for the Cloelia story, but folklore has embroidered on it: Porsenna's son Aruna and the Roman general Horatius Cocles were in love with the girl, King Taruin intercepted her and the other hostages, etc. Plutarch offers two versions of the Cloelia episode, one suggesting that Porsenna gave her a horse, whence the statue on the Via Sacra showing her on horseback. Porsenna's headquarters was at Clusium (now the town of Chiusi) near the border between Tuscany and Umbria. Herodotus called the Etruscan territory ''Umbria.'' As for Father Tiber, the gender of the Latin name, Tiberius, is masculine; the river gods of the Tiber and the Nile were always represented as men in ancient statuary.

You do not need to take a taxi from or to the airport (Ezeiza) and waste $25 or even $50 when there is bus service for roughly $4. It takes you to any major hotel in downtown Buenos Aires. All you have to do is buy the ticket from the counter of the Manuel Tienda Leon S.A. Bus Service at the airport exit. The company has its downtown offices next to the Hotel Panamericano at 9 de Julio Avenue facing the obelisk, but they pick you up from any major downtown hotel.\nOn the Recoleta there is not only the Gato Dumas Restaurant but at least a dozen other excellent restaurants where you do not need to spend $50. Brunch, nearby, at Don Juan Hippopotamus or Clark's ranges from $10 to $12.\nAlso, Buenos Aires is one of the safest places in the world at any time.\nTaxis are indeed honest and cheap and plenty, and there is no city in the world that has as many taxis as Buenos Aires. All taxis are modern and clean and the drivers polite. If the tourist wants even cheaper transportation, try the subway system. It is old and cannot compare with Washington, Mexico City or Montreal, but the price is about a dime. Nowhere else in the world will you find such fast bus service, also for about a dime.\nDespite all the problems over the last 20 years, Buenos Aires is still one of the great places in the world. It is surprising that more North Americans have not discovered it. O. CARLOS STOETZER Wilton, Conn. Shirley Christian replies: There is bus service from the airport to the city, costing between $4 and $5 a person, depending on the exchange rate. However, the operators say they do not drop people at hotels but at two downtown street locations or the close-in domestic airline terminal. It could be inconvenient for people with a lot of luggage.

982	ROMAN FLEA MARKET	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDE143EF937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: Flea markets are flea markets the world over. There's the usual assortment of junk, kitsch, household goods and used clothing, but the regular vendors at Porta Portese -the ones you find week after week in more or less the same spots - are a show in themselves. Whenever I accompany people for the first time to Rome's Porta Portese flea market, a milelong sprawl of booths and makeshift tabletops that unfolds and refolds every Sunday morning like a pop-up storybook village, I always advise them to look at the sellers as much as the merchandise.\nFlea markets are flea markets the world over. There's the usual assortment of junk, kitsch, household goods and used clothing, but the regular vendors at Porta Portese -the ones you find week after week in more or less the same spots - are a show in themselves. Whenever I accompany people for the first time to Rome's Porta Portese flea market, a milelong sprawl of booths and makeshift tabletops that unfolds and refolds every Sunday morning like a pop-up storybook village, I always advise them to look at the sellers as much as the merchandise.\nTake the two Neapolitan brothers who run a dish and glassware stand out of an old beat-up van. They drive up from Naples on Saturday night, sleep in the van and are up and in their spot on Sunday morning when the market opens around 6 A.M.. Gennaro, the older brother, works out of the side of the van, which, when lowered, reveals a kind of mobile showroom in which he is surrounded by boxes of wine glasses, stacks of pasta bowls and columns of dinner plates. His brother, on the ground below, does the wrapping and takes care of the money.\nThe show begins when Gennaro, who wears around his neck a microphone muffled by a handkerchief, selects a set of 12 dinner plates and, without once interrupting a running commentary about their merits, starts to arrange the plates in the form of an open flower bud. With turns in each direction and a flourish or two, he completes the arrangement by using one of the plates as the base and the others as the petals of the flower.\nThe climax to this modern commedia dell'arte vignette comes when - without blinking - Gennaro tosses the arrangement up into the air, and it lands intact in the outspread arms of his brother, who then squeezes the arrangement together like a deck of playing cards, wraps it in newspaper and hands it to an impressed and paying customer. It's a bravura performance that never fails to attract a crowd and just one of many you see at Porta Portese.\nAnother of my favorite regulars at Porta Portese is a tiny, wrinkle-faced old woman whom many people affectionately call the Etruscan Lady. She's on the left at the top of the broad two-laned rise that constitutes the antiques and collectibles section of the flea market. She stands apart from the other vendors around her because, instead of having a booth or a counter, she displays her goods -a few pottery shards and some rusted bronze statuettes - on a square piece of cloth spread out over the ground. She'll tell you that her bits and pieces come from the ancient Etruscan tombs that dot the countryside outside Rome, and indeed some of them look like they could be thousands of years old.\nOn close examination, however, it would seem more than likely that the Etruscan Lady is herself the oldest work of art on display. Everything else has a more recent history. The tourists and other customers either don't know this or don't care.\nA regular that anyone who has been to Porta Portese even once may recall seeing (or hearing) is an old man with a red cap and a long white beard who plays a few bars on a tiny, battered trumpet and then passes his cap. The vendors have given him the nickname Garibaldi because of the cap and the beard, which are trademarks of the Italian patriot of that name. Garibaldi's unexpected flourishes on the trumpet are so disharmonious that the vendors give him money to go away and not play in front of their booths, but I've never heard him play anything longer than five or six notes before the trumpet goes down and the cap comes off.\nIn addition to the gypsies, who should be avoided no matter how exotic they seem, Porta Portese has some regular beggars who are neither pickpockets nor thieves, but are rather harmless and fun to watch. One of these is an old man who carries a chipped coffee cup and who begs only from women. Evidently he has learned over the years that males are harder to convince of the salutary effect of parting with their change.\nAmong the amateur musicians usually found at flea markets seeking funding for their careers, Porta Portese has its own typical brand, made up of mandolin players, accordionists and flutists. But a personal favorite is the man who plays Neapolitan canzoni on a single flat laurel leaf he holds in place at his lips between the palms of his hands. It looks easy until you try it.\nLately I've become friends with a man and his wife who run a porchetta sandwich stall at the end of the used shoes section (rows and rows of perfectly polished specimens). Porchetta is the traditional Porta Portese snack on which shoppers munch while browsing. It consists of slices of roast pork dressed with rosemary and stuffed into freshly baked rosette (rolls). The pork is sliced from the end of a whole roasted pig that lies at the end of the counter.\nMy friends have been in the same spot for almost 2O years and recall, with great nostalgia, a different Porta Portese when there was less plastic and fewer good buys and more real bargains and sometimes even treasures to be found. Then, they say, you could find pieces of Galle glass, baroque gilded putti, Neapolitan creche figures and handpainted Sicilian cart pieces. Authentic examples of such items are becoming increasingly harder to find nowadays and, even when they do appear, they're snatched up almost immediately by the antique dealers or the earlycomers. (You can arrive late at Porta Portese - it closes at 1 P.M. - only if you are looking for furniture or marble because the vendors of these items are more likely to compromise on price than haul them home.) Not all the sellers at Porta Portese are Italian: a lot of them are foreigners made up of groups of Arabs selling carpets or blankets; Africans hawking wood sculptures or medicinal cures. But one group -Russian Jews - have become regulars and now have their own section of the flea market where they sell linen, caviar, binoculars and ballet slippers, along with handpainted lacquer boxes from Odessa and cigars from Havana.\nOriginally these items were carried out in the suitcases of refugees on their way to homes in North America. Once that emigration stopped, the present vendors took up residence in Rome. It's always a bit startling to come upon this section and notice the shift in vowels from Italian to Russian and suddenly to see samovars and balalaikas.\nBargaining at Porta Portese doesn't have to be a problem, as I learned from one of the regulars, a man who breeds passenger pigeons and walks around the market taking orders. Perched on his shoulder is Loredana, his pride and joy and a live example of the kind of results Mario can provide if you are so in need.\nWhen I asked Mario about bargaining, he advised me never to be afraid to try and not to worry about the language barrier because the vendors are used to foreigners and have their own ways of communicating. As Loredana pecked away at the buttons on his shirt, Mario gave me some step-by-step advice on how to proceed: ''First, cut the price any vendor asks for in half; then, move away a little bit, but not too far.'' With Loredana flapping about, he showed me how to do this. ''Then look at something else,'' he said, demonstrating the right kind of mock interest, ''and if the vendor still won't come down on the price, then you have only one thing left to try: Put the money in his hand,'' he said, stroking Loredana's back, ''They can't resist the feel of money.''\nAnd that was just about the best advice I ever got from a regular (and his bird) at Porta Portese.

984	IT'S HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDA1F31F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: I COULDA been a contender.\nI COULDA been a contender.\nOr so I used to think, whenever I watched a quiz show on television and knew the answer before the contestants. The money, cars, furs and press-on nails I've won as an armchair contestant over the years boggle the mind.\nI was never one for soap operas. I don't know who shot J.R. But give me a TV Guide full of quiz shows, and I can while away hours at a time.\nNot long ago, I finally got a chance to try the real thing. When a friend in Los Angeles offered me a place to stay, I was packed and on my way, faster than you can say ''Jeopardy.'' I left behind the racy novels I usually read when I fly cross-country. Instead, I spent five-and-a-half hours memorizing Trivial Pursuit questions.\nMy strategy was all mapped out. I was going for the shows that relied on brainpower and that paid off in big bucks. No porcelain dalmations or Desserts of the Month for me, thanks.\nOf course, this plan was based on the naive assumption that I would get on the show of my choice. After all, if I were going all the way to California at my own expense, how could I be turned down?''\nEasily. The competition for shows with cash prizes is formidable. When I called to book my tryouts, I was told that ''$25,000 Pyramid'' and ''Super Password'' both had month-long waiting lists. ''Jackpot'' was so backlogged it wasn't even scheduling tapings. So I settled for ''Card Sharks,'' ''Scrabble'' and ''Sale of the Century,'' figuring these would be less competitive.\nWrong again. Anywhere from 150 to 200 people showed up for each tryout. And that was only the first step. Only about one out of every 115 people who try out for ''Sale of the Century'' actually gets on the show.\nThe tryouts were held at the production companies, not the television studios, and lasted two to three hours. Each show has contestant coordinators, who are in charge of everything related to the contestants, including selection. The coordinators started out by having us introduce ourselves. Then they administered a test similar to the actual show.\nFor example, at ''Card Sharks,'' we had to guess how many people responded yes or no to specific questions. Then we had to yell ''Higher! Higher!'' or ''Lower! Lower!'' the way they do on television.\nAt ''Sale of the Century,'' we took a general knowledge test. Some answers I knew. Who wrote Moby Dick? (Herman Melville.) What did Elias Howe invent that helped home workers? (The sewing machine.) Some I guessed at. What are seraphim? (Angels.) Who wrote the Aneneid? (Virgil.) Where is the Bridge of Sighs? (I'm still not sure, but I think it's Venice.) And some I got wrong. Where is the vitreous humor? (The eye.) What state has two peninsulas connected by the Mackinaw Bridge? (Michigan.) My father couldn't understand why the questions were so hard. ''Why do you have to be so smart,'' he wanted to know, ''if all you do is dress up like a chicken and pick a door?''\n''No, no, Dad,'' I explained. ''It's 'Sale of the Century,' not 'Let's Make A Deal.' ''\nNext came the personality test. It meant giving our life histories in 30 seconds, without mentioning sex, politics or religion.\nIf we weren't sure what to do, we could ask the people sitting near us. Many had been through tryouts before. One woman was using her whole vacation for tryouts. She was with a friend who had won a motorcycle on ''Wheel of Fortune,'' or ''Wheel of Misfortune,'' as the contestant coordinators called it. Another had a two-page schedule of all the Los Angeles-based tryouts, and intended to hit them all.\nMost of the people trying out lived in Southern California, but there were people in my group from New York, Kentucky and Alabama. I met students, retirees, a teacher of religion, a track official, a serviceman, a chemist who was playing hooky from an international conference in Anaheim and a husband-and-wife team. (They assumed that if one spouse wasn't selected, the other would be.) One man was there because he had bet his son that if he didn't lose 25 pounds in three months, he would try out.\nAlong with 25 others, I survived the cuts for ''Sale of the Century,'' and was invited back the next morning for a callback. The callback has two parts - three, if I count staying up all night worrying about the other two. First, we had to tell some funny stories about ourselves that Jim Perry, the show host, could use to introduce us. We were primed by the contestant coordinators: ''Project your voice.'' ''Make eye contact.'' ''Sit still.'' (We were in swivel chairs.) And one more thing: ''Use Jim's name. 'Yes, Jim.' 'That's right, Jim.' He likes that.'' From then until my taping, I practiced by calling my husband ''Jim.''\nThen we ran through the game. The pressure was on: people failed the run-through if they couldn't answer any questions before the other contestants or if they weren't enthusiastic enough. Two people failed because they answered a question with a question. (''This is not 'Jeopardy,' '' we were reminded more than once.) Only eight of us managed to get through the callback. Men had an advantage, as fewer of them tried out and the contestant coordinators wanted both sexes to be equally represented. People in the armed services had a good chance, as long as they were in uniform. So did out-of-towners, especially those with unusual accents.\nThe instructions we received regarding our taping seemed endless. Besides remembering to smile, project our voices and call Jim by name, we also had to bring our Social Security cards and five changes of clothes to the studio. Five shows were taped each day, and after each show, the winner was supposed to change into another outfit so the next taping would seem like a new day. Women had to wear solid-colored skirts and blouses or dresses - no pants. No prints. No denim. No white, yellow, beige or black, except for one black skirt.\nThe day of my taping dawned, but that's about all. It was cold. Worse, it was raining. When it rains in Los Angeles, traffic stops. The only way to distinguish the Los Angeles freeways from the Long Island Expressway during rush hour is that Los Angeles drivers all have phones in their cars.\nI finally made it to the studio, where the NBC Compliance and Practice staff collected our Social Security cards and gave us more instructions: No talking to ''anyone or anything,'' except the other contestants and the contestant coordinators. Our guests were kept far away from us, just in case they might have seen or heard something that could help us.\nWe signed numerous releases, swearing that we met all eligibility requirements, that we understood our winnings would not be sent until 90 days after our tapes aired, and that we would pay any required taxes on our winnings (that's why they wanted our Social Security numbers). I think somewhere in there I also promised them my BMW.\nFinally, our big moment arrived, and we were escorted into the studio. It sure didn't look the way I thought national television would. The studio was much smaller than I'd expected, with a big hole in the carpet that was patched while we waited. And one look made it clear why we'd been told in the run-through not to swivel in our chairs. The contestants' chairs were close to the edge of the platform. If we rolled back too far, we would fall off.\nI could give you all sorts of reasons why I didn't win: I am a leftie and the buzzers were on the contestants' right; I was assigned the middle seat and no one in the middle seat ever seems to win.\nBut the real reason I lost was that I was too distracted by everything else going on in the studio to pay much attention to the game.\nPrizes were being positioned. Cue cards were being set up. The crew was priming the audience. I followed it all, and at times forgot I was supposed to be participating in the show, not just watching it!\nWhen I finally did buzz in, it was a disaster. The answer was ''shark.'' I have a Boston accent, so the answer came out ''shaaak.'' Jim Perry couldn't understand me, and I had to keep repeating it.\nI only led once during the show, but it was at the best time - when the player in the lead gets to try for the jackpot. That day it was $9,000. I had to pick which of three boxes the money was in (the other two had $100 bills). Naturally, I picked the wrong one.\nI came in second. I won $144, press-on nails, diet breakfast food, the ''Sale of the Century'' home game and other miscellaneous items that I'll receive in 90 days. I didn't even get lunch.\nWas the experience worth the more than $1,000 I spent on airfare, car rentals and eating out every night? I think so. The story makes great dinner conversation and my friends are all extremely jealous of my press-on nails. My husband says he would have paid even more just to get me to stop talking about going on a game show.\nHe doesn't know it yet, but I'm thinking about trying out again next year. I watched a show the other day, and the winner was so slow to hit the buzzer that I kept thinking, ''I coulda been a contender...''\nBy the way, just in case you're ever on a game show and they ask: ''I coulda been a contender'' comes from the movie ''On The Waterfront.'' Marlon Brando said it.\nWESTCHESTER OPINION
985	STORM WARNING: ON THE HOME FRONT	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D91F31F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: WITH the season for blizzards just around the corner, it's time to take stock and prepare for the worst. Last year, after almost 24 hours of dire warnings, all a cautious mother would learn from the television commentators was to lay in a supply of batteries, bottled water and masking tape. Frankly, that wouldn't get you through the first 15 minutes in a real storm if you had kids.\nWITH the season for blizzards just around the corner, it's time to take stock and prepare for the worst. Last year, after almost 24 hours of dire warnings, all a cautious mother would learn from the television commentators was to lay in a supply of batteries, bottled water and masking tape. Frankly, that wouldn't get you through the first 15 minutes in a real storm if you had kids. Let's be honest, batteries are good either to make toy robots whir forever, or to make flashlights work so you can play coal miner. The best that bottled water will get you is a full water pistol. Masking tape, however, may come in handy if you finally decide to tape hands, feet and even little mouths after a full day in the house. In any case, in anticipation of a winter full of storms, any household with children should consider stocking the ''real'' necessities.\nTo begin, at the first hint of a storm, assume school will close, thus assuring that the storm will go elsewhere. This means that the kids will be home all day with nothing to do, but you can't let them outside because the storm might hit. Entertainment is up to you.\nTherefore, first purchase a supply of important foodstuffs. Discount all suggestions of canned goods. Your children don't eat canned peas when there isn't a storm; they're certainly not going to eat them now. Do not buy any frozen dinners. If the microwave isn't working there is nothing worse than a frozen enchilada. Crunchy, possibly nutritious, but incredibly depressing. Do be sure and lay in a supply of soda, potato chips and cookies. To justify these purchases, remember that these foodstuffs do not have to be cooked, warm soda (should ice be unavailable) offends no one, and this type of food cuts down on the arguments about why there is never anything good to eat in the house. Put your guilt to rest by buying some fruit or sunflower seeds to munch on between serious snacks.\nI, personally, also suggest a supply of chocolate chips. Baking is a diversion for the children in between game shows and cartoons. While the kids may or may not help you cook, they most certainly will eat. Further, should all power go off, chocolate chips by the handful aren't a bad snack (for you or the kids).\nRemember, space your activities well. During one storm, I made the fatal mistake of baking cookies at 9:30 in the morning. That meant that by 10 in the morning we had already used up one of our best ''pass the time'' activities; the kids were well on their way to a sugar high and it seemed pointless to suggest that 10 in the morning was a tad early for soda. Which leads to the next point. At these times it's never too early for a snack. Overeating may possibly lead to naps - a welcome relief.\nNext, secretly buy a tape for your VCR - one with absolutely no redeeming educational value and that your kids have always wanted to rent. Hide it and save it for a rainy/snowy day. No need to point out that in the snow belt you need a VCR as a basic survival tool. Do not count on cable television to meet your programming needs. Cable transmission goes out when the sun is shining and the temperature is in the 90's. You can't count on the standard broadcasting networks either. Clearly members of the weathermen's union see storms, or even better anticipate storms, as their golden opportunity for stardom. All programming is permanently interrupted as meterologists compete to dazzle the audience with unintelligible gibberish about warm air masses that are about to dump 20 inches of snow either on my house or the Atlantic Ocean, whichever comes first. Scarcely the type of entertainment to prevent fratricidal homicide.\nDo not forget to buy a surge protector for the computer. Should the power go out in the middle of ''Pac Man,'' at least you won't lose thousands of dollars worth of equipment or software. This is no time for quibbling over how many hours a child can play computer games before his eyes glaze, his hand becomes permanently attached to the joystick and all brain cells atrophy.\nLastly, try and make the storm work for you. The day before one storm, my first-grader came home with the news that his homework for the night was to prepare for a natural disaster. He was told by his teacher to be sure and clean up the backyard and bring in all the toys. Was it wrong of me that I suggested that hurricanes, tornadoes and blizzards were drawn inexorably to messy rooms?\nThe list of essentials might get you through the first six hours of calamitous weather. By that point, one hopes, there are either snow drifts or puddles that the kids can attack. In any case it is clear that whoever wrote the lyrics ''the weather outside is frightful, but in here it's so delightful, let it snow, let it snow,'' did not have children at home.\nWESTCHESTER OPINION

My Eden had become a voodoo island.\nMY magical garden, my little slice of paradise, lay plundered and desecrated. Rising above the weeds various enough to fill a botanist's volume, on discarded broomsticks and rotted tomato stakes, hung sacks of human hair. My Eden had become a voodoo island.\nSurrounding these gruesome totems were the remains of once-joyful effort - chomped-off tomato and cucumber plants, zinnias, black-eyed susans, gloriosa daisies and sunflowers, squash and pumpkin vines. All that had survived unscathed - as in comic relief - was an abundance of garlic plants, which recently stood with their goose-like heads filled with next year's tiny seeds. Hundreds of these morsels were sniffed and ignored by the marauder.\nThis all stemmed from the day I read in a major English-language daily that hanging bags of human hair, preferably unwashed, would deter foraging deer. Having, the previous season, dispatched by stealth, cunning and explosives a resident woodchuck, and having seen earlier this year a deer the size of a Russian tank blithely nibbling my strawberries and perennials, I took swift action.\nFeeling I was slipping into an event almost Biblical in its mood and significance, I went before my mirror, reached for a plastic gadget fitted with a razor blade and sheared off most of my hair. Those who know me and my limited supply were moved either to awe or laughter by the sacrifice. When the task was done, I looked more like an extremely old Boy Scout about to leave for summer camp than a fairly young writer, but I had my sack of hair. I rushed down to the garden and tied it to a cage supporting a crop of promising green tomatoes.\nThe next evening upon arriving home from the city - after accepting in rather excellent humor, I felt, a day of mean-spirited tonsorial comment - I returned to the garden. A giant bite had been taken out of the most mature tomato and a good portion of one entire plant had been ripped from the main stem. Obviously, the situation called for more hair.\nThe first chance I had, I rounded up my three young children and headed for Mr. Gino. Mr. Gino is a gentleman of skill, patience and tact, but when I told him why the children were getting haircuts, all he could manage was a meek grin to mask his disbelief. ''Ah, I hear that works sometimes for the deer,'' he said. I also caught him staring at my head when he thought I wasn't looking.\nWhen the three heads were shorn, Mr. Gino began sweeping up, but when he aimed his broom under the other barber's chair I protested. ''No, no, this is my family only against the deer.'' He dumped our ammunition in a brown supermarket bag and we returned home loaded.\nThe hair totems went up wherever I had cultivated our series of raised beds. As I later announced to three thoroughly befuddled children, ''You have witnessed a hair-raising event.''\nWeeks went by. At first, it seemed, what I had begun to call ''the damned Bambi'' was discouraged. But ultimately it became bolder than ever. In four or five weeks, Bambi and perhaps accomplices had laid waste to every precious growing thing save the garlics.\nBut, just a minute. Maybe I had aimed at the wrong prey, had falsely accused these gentle and lovable animals. I called in my friend Joe Stahl, who manages the huge Hudson Pines Farm for the Rockefeller family in Pocantico Hills. Joe and I walked among my weed collection - all effort at farming since abandoned -while his children and mine hung back and our wives waited on the terrace. Joe held a few remnants of plants and flowers in his hands, brushed the occasional still-bare spot of soil with his shoe, stood upright and peered around at the woods.\n''Don't see deer tracks, but that's because the soil's so dry now,'' he said. ''It's definitely deer. Look how high they've eaten on the plant. Nothing else does that.''\nJoe Stahl went on to reveal that deer had eaten a sizable part of the corn crop intended to feed the Hudson Pines cattle herd, and as he spoke I saw, growing close to the groud, a curious-looking dark weed I'd never spotted before. I reached down to examine it. It wasn't a weed. The deer had helped itself to a mouthful of my hair hanging in one of the sacks and then had spit it out.\nAt dinner that night, the children, who had been curious if not always sympathetic witnesses as my dismay about the deer grew to despair, brought up the subject directly for the first time.\n''Daddy,'' asked the youngest, ''who is this 'damned Bambi' you're always talking about?''\n''That's not a fit subject for the table, Sweetheart,'' I told her. ''Bambi was a very unpleasant critter, just like the one in our garden. As I recall, someone sold her story to Hollywood and they cleaned up her act for the movies.'' WESTCHESTER OPINION

Some recipes are especially suited to revising. Here's a case in point.\nStart with chicken cutlets, the boned and skinned breast halves that are sold in supermarkets. (Or you can start with whole breasts and bone and skin your own.) The recipe that calls for stuffing them, then cooking them in sauce can be varied almost infinitely.\nA spinach stuffing seasoned with cheese and walnuts, with a red wine sauce spiked with balsamic vinegar, is one approach. Mushroom duxelles, a fine puree of mushrooms and shallots enriched with a little cream, makes a different dish, this time the sauce based on dry Marsala wine and smoothed wih some cream.Smoked mozzarella bound with rice provides yet another taste for the stuffing, its sauce made with tomatoes and white wine. Each of these recipes is cooked in about the same manner; the set of stuffing ingredients and sauce flavorings have changed.\nTry a few variations on your own. A filling of pesto and bread crumbs with a light tomato sauce might be one idea. Cooked wild rice and shallots bound with a bit of cream in a sherry-and-cream sauce is another. Finely minced ginger, scallions, garlic, Smithfield ham and water chestnuts for a filling, with a sauce of chicken stock and dry sherry, gives the dish a Chinese character, especially if the chicken rolls are dusted lightly with water chestnut flour or cornstarch instead of wheat flour.\nChicken Breasts Stuffed with Spinach 1 pound fresh spinach or a 10-ounce package of frozen. 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons finely minced shallots 1 clove garlic, minced\n1/2 teaspoon dried sage 2 tablespoons walnuts 2 tablespoons freshly grated Italian Parmesan cheese\nSalt and freshly ground pepper 8 small boned and skinned chicken breasts, about 2 1/2 ounces each, pounded thin. 4 tablespoons flour 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup dry red wine 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\n1. Trim the spinach of any coarse stems, wash it very well and chop it. If using frozen spinach, defrost it. Heat butter in a large skillet. Add one tablespoons of the shallots and the garlic and saute over medium low heat until tender. Add the fresh or frozen spinach and cook until the spinach is completely wilted and any excess liquid evaporated from the pan.\n2. Transfer spinach to a food processor; add sage, walnuts and cheese and process to a fine puree. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n3. Spread about a tablespoon of this mixture on each flattened chicken breast, roll the chicken around the filling and secure with toothpicks or tie with butcher's cord. Dust each roll lightly with flour.\n4. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the chicken and saute quickly over medium high heat until golden brown on all sides.

988	COVERING RISK ON THE SLOPE	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D61F31F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: The Europeans seem to have come up with an emergency rescue card without which one should never put foot to ski boot. It is Carte Neige, or Snow Card, and advertisements prominently posted around the French Alpine ski resort of Courchevel last season touted it as the best thing since chairlifts.\nThe Europeans seem to have come up with an emergency rescue card without which one should never put foot to ski boot. It is Carte Neige, or Snow Card, and advertisements prominently posted around the French Alpine ski resort of Courchevel last season touted it as the best thing since chairlifts.\nThe card covers the cost of searching for and rescuing an injured skier (up to about $1,000 to $3,000 an occurrence, depending on where the accident occurred and how extensive the rescue operation was), then transporting the skier to a medical clinic, hospital or home (up to about $900 an occurrence). It also pays for emergency medical treatment (up to about $800), for the forfeiture of lift ticket and ski school pass and for legal defense if the skier is sued for property damage or for injury to other skiers. Its brochure says Carte Neige will even pay for transporting the insured's body to a mortuary in the event of a fatality.\nThe coverage is not limited to ski resorts in France; it extends worldwide, according to the brochure. And, a spokesman said, it covers all mountain sports except activities like parasailing.\nFor all this, the individual vacationer pays about $20 for the season beginning and ending Nov. 15, or about $15 for an eight-day vacation. A family of four can buy coverage for about $65 for the season.\nCarte Neige is available through the French Ski Federation (La Federation Francaise de Ski), at French travel agencies and at ski schools. For more information, one can call the ski club in Annecy (50.51.40.34) or Carte Neige headquarters in Paris (45.72.64.40).\nSkiers as well as professionals knowledgeable about medical insurance said they knew of no coverage offered in the United States similar to Carte Neige.\nIn any event, the American skier headed for slopes abroad should consider how Carte Neige might duplicate medical insurance coverage he or she already has or could get with a travel insurance policy.\nA member of a health maintenance organization like Health Insurance Plan of Manhattan, for example, would have to bring back all itemized bills showing diagnosis, date of service and date of charge and then could expect to be reimbursed for all ''reasonable and customary'' doctors' charges, hospital charges in full and other charges directly related to the injury.\nBut would this include, for example, the ski patrol's charge for search, rescue and transportation off the slopes? ''That's a gray area,'' a HIP spokesman said. And how long might the skier wait for a claim to be processed and for a reimbursement check to arrive in the mail? A minimum of six to eight weeks.\nA subscriber of Blue Cross-Blue Shield who has basic coverage would be required to bring back all itemized bills and ''have them put into English and American money,'' a spokesman said. Most physician and hospital charges would be reimbursed in full, but the basic policy would not cover any transportation charges, she added. And the claimant would wait at least 21 working days for reimbursement.\nThe HIP and Blue Cross clients, of course, would pay nothing extra for this coverage, but neither would they be gaining such Carte Neige benefits as legal-defense insurance and reimbursement for the unused lift ticket.\nThe initial reaction of Americans on their first ski trip to Europe might be: Is this a good deal? Is Carte Neige even necessary?\nThe answers require a comparison of, well, les pommes et l'oranges.\nIt helps to compare some basic fiscal, philosophical and jurisprudential differences between French and American ski resorts:\n* In France, an injured skier requiring rescue by the ski patrol is charged a fee ($85 to $150, or more if a helicopter is required) that must be paid on the spot unless one is covered by Carte Neige or similar medical insurance programs available in France; thus the ski patrol is a service that, in effect, helps pay for itself. In the United States, there is no charge for rescue or transport by the ski patrol, unless one considers that the cost of this service is, in effect, included in the price of the lift ticket, so all skiers actually pay for it whether they need it or not.\nOn the other hand, some Americans would argue that, relative to French resorts, United States resorts provide far more amenities for the skier's dollar and the ski patrol is one such amenity.\n* In France, ski patrols are staffed by professionally trained, state-tested and state-regulated emergency medical technicians who are paid by the resort operators. In the United States, ski patrols operate under very little governmental regulation; although most major resorts are moving toward all-professional patrols, a spokesman for the National Ski Patrol System acknowledged that most ski patrolers nationwide are volunteers who are usually paid with free season ski passes and must heed only those training requirements established by the resort managers.\n* In the United States, the cost of liability insurance has helped push up lift ticket prices and threatened to close some ski resorts. Paul Parot, director of skiing services at Killington, Vt., said ''one of our main reasons for going pro'' in ski patrol services was the liability insurance issue. In France, this seems to be a nonissue, mostly because of differences in the legal system that result in far fewer lawsuits for damages.\nCarte Neige's basic coverage could also be approximated in a travel insurance policy. Mutual of Omaha, for example, sells four types of travel accident insurance; a policy for eight days' duration that pays $15,000 for loss of life, limb or sight, $1,500 accident medical expense benefits and $150 monthly in the event of total disability would cost $3.08.\nIt would not pay the ski patrol's rescue charge, but a separate trip cancellation policy would cover emergency transportation to the nearest medical facility if you had to interrupt your vacation because of covered illness or injuries. That would cost $30.40 for $800 worth of coverage. The two policies together would thus cost $33.48.\nAfter so many apples and oranges, the skier is likely to be a bit dazed by the options available, much in the way of someone shopping for the best buy among video cassette recorders.\nAn American skier in Europe probably ought to consider buying the eight-day Carte Neige; its $15 cost would be well worth it if only for the rescue service that would otherwise cost $85 and might not be reimbursed.\nBut, then, the ski patrolers at Courchevel boast that the huge resort records only 350 injuries among the more than 1.5 million skiers who use it each season. Such a figure is hard to verify, given the ski patrols' differences in definition and recordkeeping, but if it is true it is only about one-tenth the average rate of injury reported by American resorts.\nPhilippe Mermin, a Courchevel ski patroler for 15 years, attributed this record to the well-staffed operation of the resort, to the grooming that the trails are given year round, to the European skiers' penchant for instruction and safe skiing and to the Europeans' less litigious nature.\nInterviewed atop La Saulire, one of the highest peaks at Courchevel, one very foggy morning, Mr. Mermin said - and an officer of the company later confirmed - that Service Public des Trois Vallees, the owner and operator of Courchevel, had been sued only once in 20 years. The plaintiff, a man who had been injured while skiing, lost his case.

This question was asked not only by colleagues, but also by friends, acquaintances and even the unknown woman-on-the-street.\nAnd that question used to drive me around the bend. There was only a slight rounding of my belly. I hadn't yet heard my baby's heartbeat. I wanted to know that everything was all right. I wanted it to sink in - I'm going to be a parent -my life is changed forever. I wanted to think about tiny T-shirts, warm pajama stretchies and microscopic finger nails. I was scared. I was thrilled. A baby!\n''It's the same as any other company disability,'' the woman who ran the company health care program told me. ''Six weeks' unpaid leave.'' She went on to tell me that I could take the six weeks anytime, but that most women preferred to have the maximum time with the baby, and to work ''right until the end.''\nSoon after this discussion I began to compare notes with other pregnant women on the job. ''My goal,'' one television producer said, ''is to go into labor while I'm on location, and to be back at work within two weeks.''\n''This pregnancy is going to interfere as little as possible with my life,'' a stockbroker said.\nThere seemed to be a whole new machisma afoot about pregnancy and childbirth. And I found it very threatening. I did not want to work until ''the very end,'' which, I now realize, should have been described as ''the very beginning.'' I did not want to ''keep my mind off it'' as was suggested. Rather, I really wanted to savor it, with warmth and anticipation.\nThose were the sweet feelings. There were others. Like fear, nausea, dizziness and swollen ankles. I wanted to put my feet up.\nAnd it seemed that the new machisma did not only extend to mental restraint; physical fortitude was also de rigueur. This, of course, included, and in a sense was culminated in, the prevalent attitude toward childbirth itself.\nThe questions about where I was taking my Lamaze or Bradley Painless Childbirth classes were soon forthcoming. When I answered that natural childbirth was not for me (any more than natural appendectomies were) people would react as if I wanted my unborn child to come in to this world in a coma and slip away soon thereafter.\n''I think natural childbirth is fine for women who want to try it,'' I would protest weakly. ''I just don't believe in gratuitous pain. I like pain killers. I've always liked pain killers. I wouldn't do anything to hurt the baby. I'm just talking about some local anesthesia.. . .''\nAt best, contemporaries counseled you to try not to feel gulty if, after 22 hours of labor, you ''broke down'' and asked for an epidural block. Given that my idea of breaking down was begging my obstetrician (no doubt in vain) for general anesthesia, I felt quite out of step with the times. Again, the disapproval was pronounced. I quit my job in my eighth month. I did not take a leave; I just quit. For the next month my phone would ring and it would be former colleagues. When I answered the phone ''Hello?'' they would respond with: ''Are you still around? Hasn't that baby come yet?'' I felt inclined to explain that biologically, the leaving of the job and the start of labor are not connected; and that one could loll about the house for months - even years - without a baby coming.\nFinally, the baby did come. For a few weeks I was treated like a new mommy. Flowers arrived, with congratulations, and - oh joy - dozens of tiny T-shirts and snugly warm pajama stretchies. But no sooner were my daughter and I settled into our new routine (if life with a newborn can be called routine) when advice began to pour in.\nI'm not talking about the older ladies on the street who scolded me that the baby should have her head covered in this weather. I mean being told that a comparative analysis of the benefits of Huggies, Luvs and Pampers was not a sufficient use of my master's degree. And that there was this great center where they were really loving that took babies at six weeks. And about the wonderful woman who took care of infants just three blocks from my house.\nMuch of this was apparently in concern for my mental well-being. ''Are you going crazy?'' ''Aren't you bored?'' And my favorite, from a woman who obviously had no kids, ''What do you do all day? It must be marvelous to have time to actually read a book!''\nAttitudes toward pregnancy and child rearing seemed to have taken a 180-degree turn. Once, as soon as a woman began to show, it was considered bad taste to be seen in public. Once, and not very long ago, a mother who worked outside her home was considered to be selfishly neglecting her children - no matter how great her financial need.\nBut today, if you don't go from the office to the Jane Fonda pregnancy work-out class in your ninth month, you are made to feel somehow like a failure. If controlled breathing doesn't get you through the ordeal of childbirth, you're a wimp. And if you're home raising your child, (a job with no days off, no sick leave, in which you are on call all night long, to a very small boss who is almost impossible to reason with) then you are slacking off, taking it easy and someday, one assumes, you'll finally get back to work.\nWomen's liberation was supposed to be about choices. Much of the time, these choices, with their competing emotional and financial needs, pull and tear us in different directions.\nNone of our chosen paths are without their trade-offs. Whether a mother is staying at home, working outside the home, or trying to find some workable combination, she will certainly have her share of frazzled days and ambivalent feelings.\nBut exchanging one set of stereotypes about the ''right'' way to be pregnant and the ''right'' way to be a mother with a new set is not the answer. Forced to suppress our own doubts and insecurities about our chosen paths, we then become righteous whether we are mothers at home or mothers with careers. Inevitably, we turn on each other, and that doesn't do any of us any good. Machisma is new and tough. But sisterhood has been around a long time. And it's powerful.\nCONNECTICUT OPINION

Keeping all of these elements in mind, we have compiled a number of resolutions for 1987. To wit:\nTo eschew blackened redfish, reddened blackfish, incinerated mystery fish and other ''Cajun'' catastrophes until this much-abused, badly adapted cuisine returns to its natural habitat, New Orleans, and to Paul Prudhomme, who knows how to prepare his native Cajun dishes properly.\nTo brace oneself for the next wave of food fads -Southwest, Middle East, Middle West, Thai, Muong, Uzbek, Bahian, Burmese or whatever -and enjoy the best of them, until they, too, disappear into the abyss of yesterday's fads.\nThe next time we hear ''Hi, my name is Bruce/ Brunhilde/George/Georgette and I'll be your waiter/waitress tonight,'' we promise to respond, ''Hi, I'm Martha (name chosen to preserve critic's anonymity), and this is Ted, Ed, Greg, Peg and Meg, and we're your table guests tonight.'' This response, if observed by every diner tired of the pseudo-friendly, informal approach practiced in so many restaurants these days, might go a long way toward ending this dubious custom.\nThe next time a waiter asks, ''Is everything all right?'' to tell him if it isn't - politely, of course. As part of the same resolution, we promise to return hot soup served cool, chilled soup served at room temperature, meat over- or undercooked, desserts stale and overage. It is our view that a good restaurant appreciates feedback if something is amiss. Most diners ''vote with their feet'' by not returning to a restaurant whose performance is flawed. We think it more responsible to let the establishment know what is wrong so that it can correct it.\nWhen a waiter or busboy begins clearing our plate while other diners at our table are still consuming their course, we pledge to ask him to wait until everyone is finished. This cavalier treatment may make it easier and faster for the staff cleanup, but it rushes diners and destroys the possibility of enjoyable, relaxed dining. Equally offensive is the bad timing in some restaurants whereby entrees are plopped on the table while diners are still polishing off their appetizers. Such amateur practices should be rejected by caring diners. After all, professional service is part of what we pay for when we dine out.\nTo ignore all daily specials cited by the waiter if the verbal recitation consists of more than than one appetizer, one entree and one dessert. Restaurant managements must be made to realize that most patrons' memories are not designed for total recall, nor are all waiters/waitresses competent to provide the lengthy litanies. Suggested rule-of- thumb: If the number of specials exceeds two or three items, they should be handwritten or photocopied and supplied to each table, European-style, with prices duly noted. If the price is not quoted, the diner may be in for a disagreeable surprise when the check arrives. Yet reciting the price often seems tacky. A written list of specials solves the price problem, as well.\nTo be grateful for menu simplicity and skeptical of all that describe specific dishes in True Confessions language, such as ''lovingly garnished with tender, emerald-hued, fresh basil hand-plucked from our own gardens'' or ''gently caressed with a dollop of sweet cream, whipped into peaks by chef Louis himself.''\nTo request a smoking or nonsmoking section when making a reservation by telephone. If more patrons paid attention, perhaps more restaurants with seating capacities that exceed 75 would obey the law and provide designated sections as required. The flagrant disregard of this law by many Connecticut restaurants should be a matter of public concern. It soon would be, if more of us made our preferences and protests known.\nWhen dining out personally, not professionally, we resolve to avoid restaurants that refuse to take reservations, a noticeable and disagreeable trend in many new places. This strikes us as a managerial decision that is contemptuous of patrons and nullifies attempts at gracious dining. An hourlong wait dissipates some of the fun of dining out. The no-reservations policy also smacks of greed: If you can herd waiting diners into the bar, it guarantees a higher volume of bar business. Never mind that by the time many diners totter to their restaurant table, they may be in no condition to enjoy any subtlety in the cuisine. Could that be part of the motive? If the diners have had several drinks, they are bound to be less discerning about what they eat.\nTo reward exemplary service, not just in the tip, but with complimentary words as well, both to the server and to the maitre d'hotel. Good service includes remembering which diner ordered which dish. It can be annoying to have plates dealt like cards by waiters who either do not care or can not seem to keep track of who ordered what. A course in memory training may not be part of the job description, but we have noticed good servers develop their own techniques for keeping track of who ordered what, no matter how large the party or how varied the menu choices. Not making the effort suggests an indifference to the job and the patrons.\nTo give special thanks in advance to restaurants that care enough about patrons who consider tea bags an affront to gracious dining to offer brewed tea. It is aggravating to us diehards that even some of the finest restaurants, establishments that would blanch at the idea of offering instant coffee, brandish the ubiquitous tea bag shamelessly.\nTo keep in perspective the experiences that might make one a culinary curmudgeon, and enjoy the variety and pleasures that dining out in Connecticut hopefully will yield in 1987.\nDINING OUT

The new tenant, a steak house called Abel Conklin's, is a combination of the old frame house and a 1986 addition.\nThis blending of old and new is also seen in the food.

The rest of the decor is masculine steak house: wood paneling, hunt prints, comfortable seating and a working fireplace. The atmosphere is clubby, but happily the food is better than that at most clubs.\nThe dish to have is the house special - the prime aged porterhouse steak, nicely crusted on the outside, juicy and tender inside. It can be ordered for one, two, three or four people at $19.95 a person. The filet mignon takes runner-up position. If you like filet mignon, this is a good one, large and tender, but the porterhouse is a more flavorful cut.\nThe extra-thick loin lamb chops were huge but not as tender as the beef. The steak sandwich was acceptable, but even the frugal are advised to spend the extra $5 for the porterhouse.\nFor those who do not eat meat, the best bet is the lobster, priced according to the market and size. On the night of our visit it was $27.50 for a two-and-a-half-pound lobster, perfectly cooked and nicely presented. The fish of the day is another nonmeat possibility. The mahi mahi was fresh, good and garnished with grilled fresh pineapple. On another night the fish of the day, an ocean blowfish francese, was bogged down by a soggy coating.\nSeafood is featured in the appetizers. The Norwegian smoked salmon is excellent. The jumbo shrimp cocktail consisted of truly jumbo shrimp, firm and attractively presented on romaine in a bed of ice in a silver scallop dish. Very fresh oysters on the half-shell were similarly presented.\nAll the appetizers are cold - probably a wise decision made to take the pressure off the kitchen. If you prefer to begin with something hot, try the soup of the day. Homemade Manhattan clam chowder and beef and barley soup were excellent.\nAmong the salads, the Caesar had a well-balanced dressing but was marred by commercial-quality croutons. Even though there were about a dozen different vegetables in the mixed garden salad, it was dominated by iceberg lettuce. The result was uninspired. A better choice is sliced tomatoes and onions. Where do they get these wonderful beefsteak tomatoes in winter?\nAlmost half of the entrees on the menu are strictly a la carte. Here, a la carte means just that - no potato or vegetable. Of the vegetables, the stir-fried mixed vegetables were the best, a wonderful and somewhat surprising combination of red cabbage, baby corn, broccoli, cauliflower, squash, onions, straw mushrooms, carrots, peppers and snow pea pods. Only the bland creamed spinach failed to win high marks. The best potato dish was the hash browns - very crispy, fortified with lots of onions and served piping hot.\nDesserts are baked on the premises, and there are some very good choices. The house dessert one evening was a boule de neige, a very rich flourless chocolate dessert of fudgelike consistency. Other good choices are creamy-rich Amaretto cheesecake, tangy key lime pie and apple sour cream streusel pie. The pecan pie was good but was served cold. It is a ''no-no'' to put pecan pie in the refrigerator. Desserts are garnished with fresh fruitand with a rosette of real whipped cream created with a pastry bag, not an aerosol can.\nThere is a limited but fairly priced wine list of French and California selections, with an emphasis on red wines, appropriate at a restaurant specializing in beef dishes. With a few high-priced exceptions, wines range from $9 to $35. A Chateau Talbot-St. Julien 1979 at $24 is good value. The house red wine, a light, smooth French Burgundy at $3 a glass, is commendable.\nThe service, by attractive young people, is efficient and attentive. The owners seem to be on the premises at all times, and their concern is apparent. A three-course meal, including wine, tax and tip, will average $35 to $45 a person.

992	PROPERLY CUT MOLDINGS CAN PROVIDE A DECORATIVE TOUCH	1987-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DF1630F937A35752C0A961948260	LEAD: WOOD moldings have so many uses, both decorative and practical, that few woodworking or carpentry projects can be satisfactorily completed without them.\nWOOD moldings have so many uses, both decorative and practical, that few woodworking or carpentry projects can be satisfactorily completed without them.\nIn most cases moldings add a finishing touch to a job - for example, to trim around the edges of a door or window frame, or to conceal gaps on inside or outside corners after wood wall paneling has been installed.\nMoldings can also be used to dress up a simple flush door by gluing strips to the surface to create a paneled effect. The same thing can be done on a flat painted wall. Or they can be used to add a decorative touch to otherwise plain surfaces or woodworking projects.\nA simple plywood box, for instance, can be ''dressed up'' to look like a skillfully hand-crafted chest or cabinet by simply adding moldings on the corners, and perhaps some moldings that form a design on the sides or top of the box. Two or even three different styles of molding can be combined to create a single, more elaborate-looking molding, or to create the effect of a heavy frame around a large poster or wall-mounted decoration of any kind.\nIn addition to these purely decorative uses, moldings also have many practical uses around the home, such as covering up joints or seams that are less than perfect and helping to make joints more waterproof, especially around the outside.\nRegardless of how molding is used, its final appearance will be determined by how neat a job the handyman does in fitting and joining the individual pieces. Neatly fitted joints that have no unsightly gaps or ragged edges will give the project a finished, professional look, while poorly fitted joints that have unsightly gaps or ragged edges will give the whole job an amateurish and sloppy appearance.\nTo insure snug-fitting joints, it is essential that moldings be accurately cut off at the proper angle, and that cuts be clean and smooth with no splintering. To accomplish this, a sharp, fine-toothed saw should be used, such as a backsaw or dovetail saw; even a hacksaw fitted with a coarse blade will work fine. Mitering is the technique most often used to join two pieces of molding that meet at right angles, especially on outside corners. Each piece is cut off at a 45-degree angle so that the two ends will form a 90-degree angle.\nFor accurate cutting, a miter box will be needed to guide the saw and to hold the molding steady while the cut is being made. An inexpensive or homemade one similar to the one illustrated here is more than adequate. There are also more elaborate models you can buy that are made of metal and will permit adjusting for all angles.\nNormally made of wood, these U-shaped miter boxes have one set of slots to guide the saw when cuts are to be made at a 90-degree angle, and another set of slots to guide the blade when cuts are to be made at a 45-degree angle. The molding to be cut is placed on the bottom of the box so that its back edge -the edge that will go against the wall or other surface - is against the back wall of the box. It should be in the same position as it will be when installed.\nA cove molding, for example, which normally fits into the corner between a wall and ceiling at about a 45-degree angle, should be held inside the box at the same angle. For the actual cutting, a backsaw - a special saw similar to the one shown here - is the best type of saw to use. It has a stiff metal spine along the top of the blade to insure a straight cut, and has its handle set at a more suitable angle for use with a miter box. An ordinary carpenter's saw can also be used, but it must be sharp and the finer the teeth the better. Even then, it will not give as clean a cut as a backsaw or a dovetail saw (a smaller version of a backsaw with finer teeth).\nOne problem with installing moldings on an outside corner - such as where two walls meet - is that the corner joint formed by the walls is not always exactly 90 degrees. One way to compensate for this is to cut the molding off at an angle that is slightly more or slightly less than 45 degrees after some trial fitting with scrap pieces, and possibly some sanding or filing to insure a perfect fit. Another way is to install the moldings as is -with mitered ends at a 45-degree angle -then fill in any gaps that remain by using a spackling compound or wood plastic.\nIn dealing with inside corners, the same problem often occurs. So a different technique, known as coping, is used by most professional carpenters. Even when the corner does form a 90-degree angle, it is often difficult and time-consuming to achieve a really accurate fit, because even the slightest gap will be noticeable when viewed from above. With a neatly coped joint there is seldom if ever a gap visible. And when you are not dealing with an accurate corner angle, coping solves the problem of determining the correct angle; when properly done, it almost insures a neat-looking corner joint.\nCoping is done by first cutting off the end of one piece at a straight 90-degree angle, then nailing this piece in place against one of the walls with its square end butted straight into the corner as shown. The end of the second piece is then cut off with a coping saw - a fine-toothed jigsaw that is designed for cutting intricate curves - so that its cut end matches the profile on the front of the molding when it is pushed against the face of the piece that is already in place, as shown here. With a simple shape like the one illustrated here, you can use a scrap piece of the molding to trace its profile onto the back of the piece to be coped. Then follow this outline, on the back, with your coping saw as you carefully trim off the end to match this profile.\nThis technique works only with moldings that have a flat backside and a fairly simple shape. The method that most carpenters prefer, and the one that will work with any molding, regardless of shape, is to first use a miter box to cut off the end of the second piece at a 45-degree angle, just as though it were being mitered.\nYou will then notice that the inside edge of this cut, the edge that is along the carved face, clearly outlines the face of the molding, so all you have to do is cut the end off a second time with the coping saw. Only this time you cut it off at a 90-degree angle while following the outline of the molding's face so as to reproduce its profile on the end of the piece. You can now push this into the corner with the curved or cut-out end directly up against the face of the previously installed piece on the other wall.\nWhen a single length of molding is not long enough for the job, so that two pieces have to be joined end to end, most handymen will simply butt the ends together. However, this creates a joint that is often quite visible, and one that will be prone to opening up periodically as the wood shrinks.\nA much neater and less noticeable joint that will not be affected by expansion and contraction of the wood can be made by using a technique known as scarfing. Each piece is cut off at a 45-degree angle, as shown here, then the two angled ends are overlapped, as illustrated, before being nailed in place. For best results the nails should be slanted toward the piece underneath so that they go off at an angle that will more deeply penetrate the second piece, rather than going straight through into the wall behind the two.\nQuestions about home repair should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

''You went last week. You'll grow up stupid!''\n''WHAT, again?'' my mother used to exclaim. ''You went last week. You'll grow up stupid!''\nIt was a weekly argument my mother and I had when I grew up in the 1940's in the Five Towns. The argument was whether I was to be permitted to join my friends at the Cedarhurst Movie Theater, the only movie house in all of the Five Towns. (I read recently that the theater has been converted into a shopping center - a little bit of news that released this flood of memories.) ''That movie house is a baby sitter for all the parents who want to get rid of their kids on Saturday,'' my mother used to protest while I silently prayed, ''Why can't my parents be like other parents?''\nThe only way I would get to the theater, I knew, was to convince my mother how educational the movies were. Consequently I would prepare arguments as to what ''Tarzan,'' ''The Thin Man,'' ''Love Crazy'' or ''Casablanca'' had to offer an 11- or 12-year-old girl.\nGetting permission, however, was the least of my problems. One had to have a ''date'' with a girlfriend. The one you went to the movie with determined your popularity.\nThese dates were arranged no more than two days in advance. Sometimes if there was an important football game in our small private school, the Woodmere Academy, we would opt to go to the football game rather than the movies. However, if it rained unexpectedly, ''dates'' had to be arranged hurriedly in the morning.\nDuring the 40's most people had only one phone number, and the stock market used to stay open on Saturdays until noon. That meant I had to make my calls quickly while my father groaned that he could not even call his broker on the one day he had time to talk to him.\nThe ''date'' started with lunch at one or the other's house, and one parent driving us to the movie. We would spot our friends from school and stand in line with them. Out of the corner of our eyes we would notice, too, if any of the boys we knew had come to the movies.\nI was very much influenced by the movies, and perhaps that is what my mother disapproved of. Sometimes I wore my hair over one eye like Veronica Lake; other times I tried an upsweep. I bought all the movie magazines and after reading all the gossip about my idols cut out the pictures and pasted them in a scrapbook.\nIn private I wrote preposterous short stories to be sent to Hollywood. Years later, re-reading these efforts, I recognized rehashed plots of my favorite movies.\nMuch, much later, when our marriage was breaking up, the marriage counselor said, ''We want to keep in mind that your generation was influenced by those romantic movies where all was glamour and perfect love.''\nMy first love was Gregory Peck. He was - for a young girl - a safe love up there on the screen. Of course, I was dreaming about the future -what was possible once I got out of the Five Towns.\nBecause the Five Towns had no other entertainment than the Cedarhurst Movie Theater, it was our only release from the weekly routine of homework, gym and home. It made us laugh, cry, cheer and at times gave us nightmares. It assured us that romance was around the corner and that the good guys always win, and reminded us that even though our lives were tranquil, the world was at war.\nPerhaps it is only right that if the theater had to go, it should be converted into a shopping center. Don't we in a sense shop to project our dream of how we would like to see ourselves?\nBut I have another dream - a wish as unrealistic as the movies we used to watch. I hope that at night, when they lock up the shopping center, Gregory Peck, Hedy Lamarr, Richard Conte, Veronica Lake, Cary Grant and all the rest with their wonderful romantic stories come right through the walls to haunt the place.\nCONNECTICUT OPINION

Lapham's review of my book ''The Great American Magazine'' (Nov. 16). Until now I kept deciding that nothing would be served by such a communication, and I am reluctant to grieve in print for readers who are rightly skeptical of authors' claims of foul. Even so, I continue to believe that Mr. Lapham's review is really awful, a meanspirited, condescending and smarmy piece of work that intemperately trashes Life, Henry Luce and other targets of easy opportunity. With a passing lordly pat on the head, Mr. Lapham says that I write with ''grace and charm,'' but at his hands such a compliment is more like a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. Within the grand sweep of his contempt Mr. Lapham includes ''the makers of the press'' in general, which makes me wonder what he has done all these years to keep his own principles intact while he toiled eagerly at various levels in the pits of magazine publishing, including, on numerous occasions, at Life.\nIndeed, Mr. Lapham seems altogether capable of the sort of tiresome little rhetorical sins we all find so familiar. For instance, in his review he uses a quotation from Bernard De Voto to counter something I wrote about the early Life, but he neglects to tell the reader that the De Voto quote can be found in the book - which is possibly where Mr. Lapham found it, too. On another occasion he says that I don't ''dwell on the reasons for the magazine's rise and fall,'' preferring instead ''to remember all the swell times and all the swell people.'' This is less than accurate. The book deals often and at length with the reasons for Life's failure, focuses strongly on its impending doom, and its recollections include a lot of not-so-swell times and portraits of not entirely swell people, like Luce.\nMr. Lapham appears to find it particularly damning that I enjoyed working for Life, and his review somehow suggests that the author of a really good book about such a rag would have better spent a career hating it.

Raskin's book ''The Common Good'' (Nov. 23) entirely missed the point. His major complaint - that Mr. Raskin failed to address possible ''ideologically conservaVive'' challenges to his proposals - ignored the fact that Mr. Raskin has developed a set of concrete alternatives for a more just and democratic America. Mr. Raskin's proposals offer a vision and a hope in a period when young people like myself are questioning what democracy is all about. KATHERINE ROBERTS New York

Sanders' ''Mexico'' (Dec. 7), that ''Mexico currently faces no threat from Guatemala (or indeed from Nicaragua, Cuba or the Soviet Union).''\nThose of us who warned that, after independence, India would align itself with the Soviet Union were ridiculed. Then we were told that China would not go Communist because of its family structure. Then that Cuba would not go Communist because of the Cubans' love of freedom. Then that Nicaragua would not be a Soviet target because the Soviet Union would not want to take on another Latin American country because of the cost of Cuba.\nAs one buried in the analysis of Soviet sources, I see clearly the likelihood that the Sandinistas will remain in control of Nicaragua, and then will come El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and finally Mexico. I do not say this will happen, but it is a possibility that cannot be brushed aside. RONALD HILTON Stanford, Calif.

In this case, his opposition is to a law that, if enacted, will broaden Suffolk County's power of review over building projects in our pine barrens [ ''New Dispute on Pine Barrens,'' Dec. 14 ] .\nObviously, Mr. Kulka has his own interests at stake, not those of the people of Long Island. Despite restrictions, Long Island has experienced unprecedented ''growth'' during the last five years (can you imagine the destruction that would have occurred without these restrictions?) and a corresponding decrease in the quality of certain facets of life.\nAmong these are deteriorating traffic flow (currently Mr. Kulka is working on plans to alleviate congestion along major arteries of the Hauppauge area, which he has been instrumental in developing by rerouting traffic through neighborhoods); an increase in traffic fatalities; decreasing air and water quality; an unresolved waste removal crisis, particularly in overdeveloped areas; inflation of land values and the corresponding increase in the cost of houses; a labor shortage and, recently, an enormous increase in taxes -again, particularly in overdeveloped areas. Anyone who has lived on Long Island most of his or her life recognizes the sacrifices we must make in the name of ''development.''\nWe Long Islanders must think of ourselves as a region with a distinct geographic, ecological and cultural basis, not simply as a market ripe for commercial exploitation, if we are to pass on to future generations a decent environment and a sense of place that transcends material values. Mega-developers, like Mr. Kulka, always argue that without their projects we will lose our tax base and our jobs. Similar arguments have been used by strip-mine operators in Kentucky, by pro-apartheid advocates in South Africa afraid of divestiture, and wherever wealthy land-owning people are able to control the destiny of people they think are dependent upon them.\nSooner or later Long Islanders will have to free themselves from this false notion of dependency. To do so now will save our lands, our water supply, our natural resources from further destruction; to do so later can only perpetuate an ever-spiraling cycle of ''growth'' and recession that depletes our God-given resources while adding to, not easing, our tax burden.\nJack Kulka said, ''Intelligent people do not take vast areas of land and classify them as environmentally sensitive.''\nWhy not? After all, it is such vast areas of land that form the basis of our national park and forest system, which is considered the best in the world. Intelligent people had the foresight to set aside vast areas of environmentally sensitive land decades ago; and if intelligent, not selfish or greedy people, are allowed to do the right thing today, they will continue to set aside vast tracts of land here and elsewhere for future generations.

Certainly its exposure of the misdiagnosis and misplacement of special education students, its critique of intelligence testing and its documentation of the use of special education classes to resegregate black students deserve a careful reading.\nHowever, the Grangers' book comes close to arguing that emotional and learning disabilities are fictions spread by therapists, teachers and educational bureaucrats looking for an easy ride at public expense. Specialized education for all but the most severely disabled is therefore not only a waste, but virtually a crime.\nMy wife and I spend many hours each week struggling with the educational system to get our 5-year-old son, whom we know to have special needs, the education that we know can help him -and that he has a right to.
