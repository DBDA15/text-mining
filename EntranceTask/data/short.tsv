1815742	Share Grandma's Birthday, With Music and Animation	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E2D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	FOR years, Internet users have treated online photo services like a batch of holiday snapshots -- checking them out for a while, then letting them collect dust on the shelf as soon as something new comes along.\nNow Smilebox.com, a start-up based in Redmond, Wash., is offering customers the opportunity to build online scrapbooks with animation, music and artwork. The kicker is that, in a market cluttered with free services that have struggled to produce profits, Smilebox is actually attracting paying customers.\nSmilebox.com users pay $1 or $2 to choose from among 350 graphic templates for their digital photos, or pay for a $5 monthly subscription for unlimited access to the templates.\nThose with dozens of holiday photos might choose to collect them in a virtual photo album with holiday themed artwork on the borders, for instance. Next, users can choose from among 700 musical selections to accompany the photo book, and decide on other visual flourishes, like animated transitions between pages. (Smilebox also offers a free version that includes advertisements and fewer music and template choices.)\nUnlike many other photo-sharing services, Smilebox does not require users to upload photos to the Web site and edit them there. Rather, since users download the template, they need only drag images to the desired locations on the template, then upload the entire file to the Web site. Smilebox then delivers e-mail messages to the user's friends and family, inviting them to view the book.\nShould Smilebox gain enough acceptance with consumers before the free photo services offer up competing features, analysts said, it may well build a successful business. Building a successful business of any significant size, though, may be asking too much.\n''This looks to me like a niche business,'' said Christopher Chute, an analyst with IDC, a technology consultancy. ''Getting people to pay has always been a problem, so they've got to find a hook.''\nAndrew Wright, the chief executive of Smilebox, believes he has found at least one hook into a bigger market, thanks to an alliance with Hallmark. In that partnership, the greeting card company in December started offering a modified version of Smilebox on Hallmark.com.\nAccording to Steven Ruschill, who oversees online initiatives for Hallmark's new business development group, the Smilebox partnership has yielded ''pleasantly surprising'' results, despite his company's having done nothing to promote the service. ''It's a little too early to judge it fully, but so far so good,'' he said.\nHallmark.com visitors who clicked on the Smilebox feature turned into paying customers more often than Mr. Ruschill anticipated, he said. If the number of paying customers reaches an undisclosed threshold over the next several months, he said, Hallmark will most likely retain the service on its site and continue to share the revenues with Smilebox.\n''When the novelty starts to wear off, the question is whether users will just think of this as another thing they have to do,'' he said.\nMr. Wright said that Smilebox.com's traffic climbed steadily after the company introduced it in April, reaching about 500,000 visitors in December. He would not say how many of those visitors were paying customers, but he said, ''the business model is working very well.''\nIn addition to revenues from subscriptions and one-time sales, Smilebox is also distributing Google ads alongside its free photo templates, netting the company about $7 for each 1,000 people who view a page of pictures.\nMr. Wright is, however, more focused on the fee-based service, having already built a successful subscription offering in the online games category which, like online photos, is dominated by free services. Mr. Wright formerly led RealNetworks' RealArcade, and several former RealNetworks executives, among others, have backed his business with $6 million in venture financing to date.\nMr. Wright's fee-based approach is unusual, but not unique. Smugmug, a photo-sharing service based in San Francisco, charges $40 to $150 annually for digital photo storage and sharing. Chris MacAskill, Smugmug's president, said the company is profitable, with slightly more than $10 million in annual sales, and spends nothing on marketing. He said Smilebox ''looks very interesting.''\n''I've seen quite a few attempts at it in the past,'' Mr. MacAskill said, referring to digital scrapbooking, ''including a very impressive Sony site, Screenblast, that for some reason never got traction and went away. Surely someone will make it work, and these guys look like they've got a lot of talent.''\nThe darling of free online photo-sharing, Photobucket.com, will introduce both free and paid services that will compete with Smilebox early in 2007, said Alex Welch, the company's chief executive. Mr. Welch said that service would let users create custom slideshows with audio.\n''There's definitely a huge hunger for online editing tools,'' Mr. Welch said. ''The question is whether you can charge for it and differentiate yourself enough to make a business out of it.''\nPhotobucket.com raced to the top of online photo-sharing sites in 2006, reaching 15.6 million visitors in November, according to ComScore Media Metrix, an online measurement company. A year earlier the company attracted 10 million fewer visitors, but word quickly spread among MySpace users, among others, that Photobucket simplified the process of posting photos on that Web site and others, and an Internet star was born.\nNow Mr. Welch said that even as it develops new features to keep pace with Smilebox and others, it is working harder to generate advertising revenue from visitors. The business recently created its own advertising sales team to strike deals with big brand marketers and advertising agencies. Until now, the company has distributed ads on behalf of Google and other networks, an effort that Mr. Welch said ''has worked well.''\nIf Photobucket, Smilebox and similar services generate significant profits from ads or user fees, IDC's Mr. Chute, for one, will be surprised. ''The lack of a clear revenue model has always been the bane of these sites,'' Mr. Chute said. ''The only way these guys have ever made money was to be acquired.''\nE-COMMERCE REPORT
1815743	Hush, Little Baby, Mama's Crooning	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E2D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Entering the world of Carly Simon's new album ''Into White'' (Columbia) is like tiptoeing into an enchanted garden. The fanciful Cat Stevens song that opens the record and gives it its title establishes a mood of deep, dreamy calm that is sustained over 14 songs.\nSinging quietly in a low throbbing alto caressed by exquisite folk-pop arrangements, Ms. Simon projects the warmth and intimacy of a parent caught up in the magic of the bedtime stories she is reading to her children. And the presence on the album of her two grown children, Sally and Ben Taylor, enhances its aura of a family musicale.\nOddly enough ''Into White,'' which will be released tomorrow, is not the record Ms. Simon originally intended to make. After releasing a collection of standards, ''Moonlight Serenade,'' made in the Rod Stewart mode, Ms. Simon said, 61, she longed to cut loose and make a rock 'n' roll album with Booker T. Jones, the legendary keyboardist, producer, and architect of Memphis soul. But Columbia Records executives deemed the idea uncommercial (probably wisely, she now admits) and instead proposed an album of lullabies.\n''Though it wasn't what I wanted to do, I had nothing against lullabies because I sang them to my kids, and we still sing those songs to each other,'' she said, lounging in a Manhattan hotel room recently. ''What started out as a lullaby album turned into a lulling album of gentle things by other singer-songwriters that I love. And it became what it is, an album you put on at the beginning and leave on till the end.''\nAmong the high points are sparkling renditions of the Beatles' ''Blackbird,'' ''Oh! Susanna,'' ''You Are My Sunshine,'' ''Scarborough Fair,'' ''Manha De Carnaval'' (the haunting theme from the movie ''Black Orpheus'') and a simple, unvarnished ''Over the Rainbow.'' The album's final song, ''I'll Just Remember You,'' written by Ben Taylor, was a last-minute addition. ''Into White'' includes only two originals: ''Quiet Evening,'' a collaboration with the guitarist David Saw, and a revised version of ''Love of My Life,'' written in 1992 for the Nora Ephron film ''This Is My Life.''\nBut the image ''Into White'' projects, of a woman basking in the serenity of late middle age surrounded by family, is only one aspect of Ms. Simon's complicated, larger-than-life personality. For Ms. Simon has never made a secret that she lives on a psychological rollercoaster.\nShe has persevered in the face of acute stage fright, terrifying panic attacks and assorted phobias, including a fear of flying. Her personal relationships are intense and often stormy. Eight years ago she was treated for breast cancer, and in her recovery recorded ''The Bedroom Tapes,'' the most raw and soul-searching album of her career.\nAlthough his name keeps coming up in her conversation, she is out of touch with James Taylor, the singer-songwriter and father of her children whom she divorced in 1983. ''He just doesn't get me,'' she said in a tone of regret.\nToday she lives apart from her second husband, James Hart, a writer whom she married 19 years ago. Her perspective on marriage: ''Unless you're Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, it's going to be something else besides an apple pie.''\nThat emotional turbulence runs through albums that chronicle with blunt honesty a life of extreme mood swings. The facts may be disguised, but the emotions -- ferocious passion, vengeful anger, desperate longing, jealousy, heartbreak, ecstasy -- are laid bare.\nIt can't be easy to be Carly Simon or to live with her. As she wrote in her song ''Give Me All Night'': ''I have no need of half of anything.'' It goes on to demand, ''Don't give me fountains, I need waterfalls/And when I cry, my tears will fill an ocean.'' It sounds exhausting.\nShe is unembarrassed about her candor. ''Look,'' she said, ''if you think of us on the edge of the Milky Way, we're nothing. So let's tell as much as we can. The more the better.''\nIn recent years, she said, those personal demons have taken a new form. ''I no longer have anxiety attacks,'' she said. ''Instead I have depression, although it isn't continuous by any measure.''\nThe death of her close friend Mindy Jostyn, in March 2005, plunged her into the depths. The wife of her longtime songwriting collaborator Jacob Brackman, Ms. Jostyn was both her musical director and soul mate.\n''When Mindy died, a switch flipped in me, and I fell apart,'' she recalled. ''I remember taking pictures for the cover of 'Moonlight Serenade' the day before I went to the hospital, because I could no longer eat. People had to force tomatoes into my mouth. I'm 5-10, and I was down to 112 pounds.''\nShe is nothing if not resilient. At a time when the record industry is contracting, Ms. Simon remains one of a handful of acclaimed singer-songwriters who have been able to hang on to a major label, but just barely. Her contract with Columbia guaranteed the company would record a sequel to ''Moonlight Serenade'' if it went gold (500,000), but it fell slightly short. Columbia renewed her contract, but only if she would make the record the label wanted. She wonders now if anyone will want to make an album of her original songs.\n''I probably have 300 lyrics now,'' she said. ''I always write lyrics first. But because of my age I may have to turn them into a book of poetry.''\nMs. Simon has almost finished a first draft of a play, as yet untitled, which she described as being about ''justice and the hypocrisy of justice.'' One of its characters is her friend John Forté, the prep school-educated rapper who worked with the Fugees.\nSix years ago he was arrested in Texas for cocaine possession with intent to distribute after being found transporting liquid cocaine that he said he thought was money. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Ms. Simon, who met Mr. Forté through her son, believes his story, and initially put up $250,000 of bail money and has subsequently waged an ardent campaign on his behalf, but so far to no avail. ''I'm proud of the work I have done for John,'' she said. ''But I am terribly despondent over not being able to get him out.''\nAlthough Ms. Simon still keeps an apartment in New York, she spends most of her time on her 40-acre farm on Martha's Vineyard, where both her children have residences. Ben, when he is not on tour, lives in a cottage he took over from the caretaker. Sally and her husband, Dean Bragonier, an ecologist, are building their own house there. Both children are musicians; each has put out three solo albums on small labels.\n''Living a low-profile life has been extremely helpful,'' Ms. Simon said. ''I think I would have burned out had I lived in one of the major show-business cities. My life is mainly being at home and in the garden and playing guitar and piano.''\nOn good days this may be the closest Ms. Simon comes to inhabiting the enchanted garden evoked on her luminous new album.\nMUSIC

Children were everywhere, a rare sight at the venerable institution. They were having pictures taken in front of the house, dashing up and down the stairs of the Grand Promenade and, before long, sitting up in their seats all over the auditorium.\nPeter Gelb, the Met's new general manager, whose multifaceted outreach efforts have already become a model for opera companies everywhere, has rightly stated that the major impediment to making this art form accessible to children is that most operas are simply too long. So besides translating the text from German into English, the solution here was to cut the production, which normally lasts 3 hours 10 minutes, down to 100 minutes without an intermission.\nActually the matinee clocked in at close to two hours, but few of the children seemed to mind. The audience was remarkably attentive and well behaved. Of course one strict Met protocol -- if you leave the auditorium, you are not allowed re-entry until intermission -- was wisely ditched for the day, so children could take restroom breaks.\nShortening the score involved what must have been painstaking decisions. The overture and several entire arias and ensembles were cut. Other arias were abridged through some very deft trims. Otherwise the Met went all out. The cast was excellent, and James Levine conducted.\nThe very free English translation by the poet J. D. McClatchy was clever and singable. Papageno, still without a girlfriend and miserable, asks forlornly: ''Is my face just one big puddle? Aren't I cute enough to cuddle?''\nThe Papageno, Nathan Gunn, was certainly cute enough. This dynamic baritone exuded charm and cavorted about the stage like an acrobat. At one point he tried to flee danger by scurrying up the side of a huge plastic tube he was trapped in, only to slide back down, landing with the floppy-limbed aplomb of a Charlie Chaplin. He seemed the darling of every child in attendance (and the audience included Mr. Gunn's five).\nThe stupendous bass René Pape was Sarastro. A lovely, clear-voiced lyric soprano, Ying Huang, in her debut role at the Met, was an alluring Pamina. Matthew Polenzani brought his sweet tenor voice and wholesome appeal to Prince Tamino. The agile coloratura soprano Erika Miklosa was a vocally fearless and aptly chilling Queen of the Night. As the wicked Monostatos, the trim tenor Greg Fedderly was unrecognizable with his flabby, fake pot belly, which induced giggles every time he exposed it.\nI am on record as being no fan of Ms. Taymor's production, which to me is a mishmash of imagery, so cluttered with puppets, flying objects and fire-breathing statues that it overwhelms Mozart's music. But this show was not presented with me in mind. So let me offer the reactions of three young attendees. Amitav Mitra, my neighbor, who is 8, came as my guest. And Kira and Jonah Newmark, 9 and 7, the children of friends, were also glad to share their critiques afterwards.\nFor Amitav, this was his first opera. Though Jonah had seen opera videos at home with his sister, he too was trying the real thing for the first time. Kira, a burgeoning opera buff, has attended, as she put it, ''real three-hour operas,'' most recently ''The Barber of Seville'' at the New York City Opera.\nNot surprisingly Ms. Taymor's fanciful sets, costumes and puppets won raves from this trio of critics. But their most revealing comments were about the singing and the story.\nThe singing ''was loud,'' Amitav said. Jonah added, ''It was too loud.'' Kira more or less agreed. I pressed them about this. Today, when children hear amplified music everywhere, often channeled right into their ears through headphones, how could unamplified singing seem too loud?\nAmitav clarified their reactions when he said that the singing was ''too loud for human voices,'' adding, ''I never thought voices could do that.''\nSo their reaction was not a complaint about excessive volume, but rather an attempt to explain the awesome impression made by Ms. Miklosa's dazzlingly high vocal flights as the Queen of the Night, or Mr. Pape's unearthly powerful bass voice, or the amassed chorus in the temple scenes. It takes a while for young opera neophytes to adjust to such mind-boggling voices, to realize that this strange, unamplified ''loudness'' is actually amazing.\nThe other common reaction concerned the story, which all three children enjoyed. Kira, though, was struck by the gravity of Prince Tamino's dilemma. ''Tamino was a little too serious for me,'' she said, adding: ''He never does anything that's funny. He takes things seriously.''\nI think Mr. Levine, who conducted a glowing and elegant performance, would be pleased by Kira's reaction. Mr. Levine made certain that some of the opera's most somber episodes were included, like the long scene in which the confused Tamino is confronted by the austere Speaker (David Pittsinger), a stalwart member of Sarastro's brotherhood, at the entrance to the temple.\nLike most fairy tales ''The Magic Flute'' is a mysterious story of good and evil. Naturally, Ms. Taymor's production makes the opera's monsters quite charming, like the puppet bears who are enchanted by Tamino's magic flute. And the boys singing the kindly Three Spirits (Bennett Kosma, Jesse Burnside Murray and Jacob A. Wade) are turned spectral and eerie, with their bodies painted white and Methuselah beards.\nThis ''Magic Flute'' was the first Met opera that was transmitted live in high-definition video to some 100 movie theaters around the world. Ultimately the point of this technological outreach is to entice newcomers into attending opera performances. The children I spoke with are likely to be back.\nSummarizing his reactions to ''The Magic Flute,'' Jonah said, ''I don't think it's going to be the best opera I'm going to go to in my life.'' What he meant, explaining further, was, ''I'm, like, going to go to others that will be even better.''\nMUSIC
1815745	France Frets As Louvre Looks Overseas	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E2D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	When the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation began offering its expertise, collections and name to new museums around the world some years ago, not a few French curators and art critics sniffed disdainfully at the idea that a major museum should rent its art and sell its brand.\nNow France too seems to be heading down a similar path, and opposition is mounting here.\nQuestions are being raised about plans to create a satellite of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, and to establish an outpost of the Georges Pompidou Center in Shanghai. Critics have accused President Jacques Chirac of using the country's museums to promote France's political and commercial interests abroad.\n''Museums are not for sale,'' proclaimed the headline of an opinion article in Le Monde on Dec. 13 signed by three heavyweights of the French art world, Françoise Cachin, former director of French museums; Jean Clair, former director of the Picasso Museum; and Roland Recht, a leading art historian.\n''From a moral point of view,'' the authors wrote, ''one can only be shocked by the commercial and promotional use of masterpieces of our national heritage.'' France should lend works of art, they said, but without charge. ''Objects of our heritage are not consumer goods,'' they added. ''And to protect them is to guarantee their universal value for tomorrow.''\nA French art Web site, La Tribune de l'Art (latribunedelart.com), quickly organized a petition endorsing Le Monde's article and demanding ''preservation of the integrity of the collections of the French museums.''\nThe government is at the center of the dispute because, unlike most major cultural institutions in the United States, France's national museums are government owned and heavily subsidized. The Culture Ministry appoints their directors and has the last word on major policy decisions.\nThus the ministry endorsed earlier, uncontroversial moves by the Louvre and the Pompidou to spread beyond their walls. Both are now building striking new satellites -- the Louvre in Lens northwest of Paris and the Pompidou in Metz in eastern France -- to display parts of their collection, much of which is permanently in storage.\nBut eyebrows were raised when the museums reached outside France. The Pompidou had hoped to participate, in collaboration with the Guggenheim, no less, in a major urban and cultural development planned for Hong Kong, but that scheme fell through. Now it is looking to open an annex in Shanghai, perhaps as soon as 2009.\nPompidou officials assert that the aim is not to make money but rather to be present in China as that country emerges as a major new center of contemporary art. And President Chirac, who recently visited China, is clearly eager to use the Pompidou to raise France's profile in the world's fastest growing economy.\nWith negotiations under way and details still under wraps, the Shanghai plan has so far raised only questions. In their article in Le Monde, Ms. Cachin, Mr. Clair and Mr. Recht asked whether it would not be wiser to expand the Pompidou itself so that it could show more of its collection in Paris.\nThe Louvre is viewed more skeptically. Last fall it began a three-year loan program to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, with a series of exhibitions of works taken from its storerooms and walls. In exchange it will receive $6.4 million to be spent on the renovation of its decorative arts galleries.\nIt is not uncommon for entire collections or exhibitions to receive loan fees. Nonetheless many critics felt it was undignified for the Louvre to be seen exchanging art for money.\nDefending the decision, Henri Loyrette, the president and director of the Louvre, argued that the program bolstered the museum's prestige, a claim supported by the popularity of its Atlanta displays. He also said that he considered the money offered by private American donors to be a contribution to the Louvre, and not a fee.\nThe Abu Dhabi project, however, has raised more complicated issues. If approved, the Louvre annex would be one of five museums planned by Abu Dhabi as part of a multibillion-dollar tourist development on Saadiyat Island. Already last July, the Guggenheim signed a memorandum of understanding with Abu Dhabi to build a museum designed by Frank Gehry.\nAccording to French press reports Mr. Loyrette was barely consulted about the Louvre's involvement and privately expressed reservations, noting that the Louvre's resources were strained by the High Museum program and the Louvre-Lens development. But, the reports said, he was overruled.\nThe critics have much to work with: the idea of removing major works from the Louvre for long periods; the usefulness of engaging in a tiny oil emirate with a population of under two million and the propriety of receiving a reported $1 billion in exchange. ''Isn't that 'selling your soul?' '' Ms. Cachin, Mr. Clair and Mr. Recht asked in Le Monde.\nSome commentators, though, have suggested that the Louvre's participation is itself a payoff. According to a French government report to Parliament, the United Arab Emirates acquired more than $10 billion worth of French armaments, mainly Mirage fighter planes, between 1996 and 2005.\nOne sign of the political sensitivity of the issue is that inquiries to the Louvre about Abu Dhabi were channeled to the Culture Ministry, where the official in charge did not respond to requests for an interview. Francine Mariani-Ducray, Ms. Cachin's successor, has insisted, however, that loans of art to the emirate did not mean ''selling'' French museums.\nAlso writing in Le Monde, she charged critics with disdaining small developing countries and said it was a tribute to French cultural influence that France had been invited to share its expertise with Abu Dhabi. ''It is a chance that should be seized,'' she said.\nIn the government, though, there are signs of still more radical thinking. Last month a report ordered by the Economy Ministry said that France should lift ''several taboos'' on its cultural policy, including allowing museums to rent or sell works of art. The report even cited the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, as a good example of how a brand could be exploited internationally.\nIt is a fact of French public life that once the president decides something, the rest of the government closes ranks around him. So those defending the uniquely spiritual quality of art may be on the ropes. On the other hand France holds presidential and parliamentary elections in the spring and after that everything could change again.
1815746	Mozart, Now Singing At a Theater Near You	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE2D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	In movie theaters across the United States on Saturday, people did an odd thing during the main attraction: They clapped. They clapped between scenes and when certain characters left the screen.\n''I did at the beginning too,'' said Walter Perron, 88, a retired chemist who was at the Walter Reade Theater in Manhattan. ''And then I thought: Who am I clapping for?''\nBut habits die hard. The show was a live broadcast, in high definition, of Mozart's ''Magic Flute'' at the Metropolitan Opera, the first of six productions to be broadcast from the Met through April.\n''The Magic Flute'' played at 100 theaters, most of them scattered throughout the United States and Canada, with seven in Britain, two in Japan and one in Norway. Though the box office receipts are not all in yet, the broadcasts seemed to be a success, with an average audience capacity of 90 percent, the Met's press office said. Forty-eight of the 60 American theaters were sold out in advance, including those in Boston; Phoenix; Louisville, Ky.; Pittsburgh; and New Brunswick, N.J. Six of the 28 Canadian theaters were sold out, as were all of the locations showing it in Britain, as well as the theater in Norway.\nThe production selected first for broadcast was in many ways the surest bet. The director Julie Taymor's take on ''The Magic Flute'' played to sold-out houses when it was initially presented at the Metropolitan Opera in 2004. To capitalize on that success, the Met, under Ms. Taymor's guidance, fashioned a 100-minute version in English (down from three hours in German) as a more child-friendly production. Did the broadcasts, as envisioned, attract people new to opera? Hard to say. Interviews at several theaters around the country suggest that the average viewer was already familiar with opera, if not an aficionado. But none of the viewers had had the chance to munch on popcorn at a local cinema in the presence of a live, Met-level performance of the aria ''Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schön.''\n''This is a good opportunity to see opera without a lot of stress,'' said Erika Homann, who was at a sold-out theater in Livonia, Mich., just outside Detroit, with her husband, their 8-year-old son, 5-year-old daughter and 11-year-old niece.\nAudiences tended to be middle-aged or older, though many parents, like Ms. Homann, brought young children. Several viewers said that they had attended productions by local opera companies but had never gone to the Met, which was a plane ride, hotel and $100-plus ticket away. These performances cost $18 a person.\n''I have been dying to go to the Met for years,'' said Leighanne Duaro, 47, of Hazel Green, Ala., who was at a theater in nearby Huntsville with her two children, ages 18 and 22, and her sister. ''This is the closest thing you can get to going to the Met, to see the production and not be there.''\nThe broadcasts did not all go off without a hitch. A theater in Jacksonville, Fla., canceled the showing because of technical problems. Viewers in Lincolnshire, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, had to move at the last minute to another screen in the theater complex.\nThe broadcast in Burbank, Calif., was plagued with stops and starts, sound problems and, at one point, a screen going completely blank. But though an usher offered refunds, most of the audience stayed to the end, making jokes whenever another glitch occurred and cheering during the curtain calls.\n''I think it was just the most incredible thing I've ever experienced,'' said Shawnet Sweets, 45, who works in the box office of the Los Angeles Opera. ''Even with the technical difficulties it was O.K., because that happens in live productions. There's always a mishap.''\nThere is a difference between seeing opera onstage and on screen, several attendees said. The camera chose the viewpoints and often closed in on a particular character rather than panning to show the whole scene.\n''One thing I wished I could have seen more of was how the sets worked,'' said Martha Edwards, 63, who was at the theater in Lincolnshire.\nBut even those who had nits to pick were quick to add that they enjoyed the show and were planning to buy tickets to future broadcasts. (''The Magic Flute'' will be rebroadcast, though not live; also on the schedule are Bellini's ''I Puritani,'' Tan Dun's ''First Emperor,'' Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' Rossini's ''Barber of Seville'' and Puccini's ''Trittico.'')\nSome viewers even questioned why the Met hadn't tried this already, praising the idea and lamenting the dwindling audience for opera. Few put it better than William T. Robinson III, a 66-year-old retired music teacher, at the theater in Huntsville.\n''If you go to many classical performances, you see that a lot of them are senior citizens, baldheaded and white,'' said Mr. Robinson, who is black and was wearing a hat. ''I think there is a need to create a new audience and get more minorities to come to these kind of activities.\n''Otherwise,'' he added, ''how are you going to get to the Metropolitan Opera from way down here in Huntsville, Alabama?''
1815747	Murdoch vs. Regan: Hollywood Girds for Latest Boldface Battle of Egos	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	When it comes to spectacle, Hollywood enjoys nothing better than a nasty legal battle between two determined and egotistical adversaries: Bette Davis meets Joan Crawford, in a courtroom.\nIn the past such face-offs have featured prominent figures like the former Disney chairman Michael D. Eisner, the DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, the superagent Michael S. Ovitz, the humorist Art Buchwald and the actress-writer Joan Collins. Many of them cringed to hear their private comments and inner thoughts offered up for public consumption.\nAnd so may it go if the headline-making book publisher Judith Regan proceeds with a lawsuit her lawyers have threatened against the News Corporation, which owns HarperCollins, the publishing house that fired her in December after the O. J. Simpson book and television project imploded.\nIn an interview last week Ms. Regan's lawyer, Bert Fields, said he was preparing to file a lawsuit for libel and wrongful termination against the News Corporation shortly after the New Year because of allegations that she had been fired after making anti-Semitic remarks during a heated phone conversation with a company lawyer.\n''My present thought is that we would sue not just for breach of contract but for libel,'' he said. ''They issued false and defamatory statements about Judith. This has been terribly destructive to her career, and I think the damages could be huge.''\nA News Corporation spokesman declined to comment officially because the matter involved an imminent lawsuit, but he provided what he said was the company view: the News Corporation was confident about its case and not worried that a third party, a temporary worker who was briefly Ms. Regan's assistant, had emerged to support Ms. Regan's account of the conversation that led to the dismissal.\n''We're very confident that what we said is not false,'' said the company executive, who added that the News Corporation chairman, Rupert Murdoch, was taking an active interest in the matter. ''But this seems to be heading more toward a public relations war than a litigation.''\nWell, naturally so. In Hollywood battles a war of words often precedes legal formalities, and Mr. Fields has plenty of experience. He has played legal counselor in headline-grabbing cases like Mr. Katzenberg versus the Walt Disney Company in the mid-1990s, and two Tom Cruise defamation cases, in Britain in 1998 and in California in 2003, both over allegations that he was homosexual.\nIn those instances Mr. Katzenberg and Mr. Cruise got satisfaction, either financial or legal, although they had to suffer through headlines that, in Mr. Cruise's case, repeated the unsupported allegations and, in Mr. Katzenberg's case, unearthed a nasty remark about his diminutive height.\nBut a case involving Ms. Regan may well prove to be uglier and more prurient. Legal scholars and prominent litigators said that proving libel is extremely difficult, but it opens the door to a public airing of the litigants' private affairs.\n''Libel is a very, very high mountain of proof to climb, and you can get destroyed in the process,'' said Pierce O'Donnell, a leading litigator who successfully sued Paramount in the 1980s for Mr. Buchwald, who contended that the studio had stolen his screenplay idea in its movie ''Coming to America.''\nMs. Regan, whose lively personal life is already well-worn fodder for tabloid gossip, will find lawyers poring over every off-color remark she may have made, Mr. O'Donnell said. Former colleagues have already emerged to confirm that she was reprimanded in the past for making an anti-Semitic remark at work.\nMr. O'Donnell said: ''She will open herself up to every scurrilous allegation. She will not enjoy one minute of this litigation. They'll hire a bulldog, and it'll be a bloodletting.''\nMeanwhile HarperCollins, which owns ReganBooks, would probably face uncomfortable questions about why it tolerated Ms. Regan for so long if the company found her behavior so objectionable.\nAnd executives would also have to submit to a detailed examination of their decision-making process in the Simpson project, a book titled ''If I Did It'' and a television interview conducted by Ms. Regan, which unleashed such a cascade of public outrage that both were canceled.\n''Everything that went on will get into evidence,'' Mr. Fields promised. ''What really happened with that interview, what Jane Friedman,'' the president of HarperCollins and Ms. Regan's former boss, ''is really like.''\nA significant issue for a jury, Mr. O'Donnell said, would be whether the accusations of anti-Semitism were merely a pretext for getting rid of the controversial publisher. HarperCollins ''may say that this was the straw that broke the camel's back, but the other side may say the straw was really the embarrassment over O. J.,'' he said.\nThe breach-of-contract matter might be considered a garden-variety case, except for the accusation of anti-Semitism. With four years remaining on her contract, Ms. Regan would have been paid several million dollars had she not been fired for cause, a general term that usually includes behavior like dishonesty, failure to carry out orders or sexual harassment.\nBut the charge of anti-Semitism itself is not a clear-cut one for either side, legal experts said. In its termination letter News Corporation did not specify the reason for Ms. Regan's dismissal, though the company did later release its account of the allegedly anti-Semitic remarks to the news media.\nMr. Fields said he planned to argue that a HarperCollins lawyer, Mark Jackson, knew that Ms. Regan never said that a ''Jewish cabal'' was in league against her during that phone conversation.\n''He stated it, knowing it was false,'' Mr. Fields said. ''These days people don't want much to do with an anti-Semite or an anti-black person.''\nOthers said it was more complicated. ''It really is a he said-she said,'' said Alan R. Friedman, a leading New York entertainment lawyer. ''Both sides have their reasons. Both witnesses have reason to be less than objective. And you have to show that it has an impact on her reputation. Will this really change anyone's opinion of Judith Regan, a 'Jewish cabal'? This isn't like denying that the Holocaust occurred. That's just a burden.''\nDavid R. Ginsburg, who is executive director of the entertainment law program at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if a jury believed she made the remark, it would be a basis for firing. ''Taking it in the abstract, it is damaging for a company to take no action while a senior executive purportedly makes anti-Semitic remarks,'' he said.\nSeveral lawyers said they imagined that the matter would never have received this much attention if not for the furor over O. J. Simpson. And they said they believed it would be settled quietly once the media noise died down because the negative implications for both sides were so great.\nOn the eve of the new year there were indications that a window might open toward conciliation. Mr. Fields suggested an apology: ''In my view they should retract what they said. If they did, it might limit the damages. We'd still sue for breach of contract, but we might not sue for libel.''\nThe News Corporation executive said the company would prefer to settle the matter quietly. ''We'd like this to go away quickly, amicably and professionally,'' he said. ''We're not going to settle at any price. We have a very strong case. But having the winning case doesn't mean you want to go to court.''
1815748	Arts, Briefly	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E1D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Peaceful Protest at 'Idomeneo'\nAbout 20 Muslims protested peacefully outside the Deutsche Oper in Berlin when it presented the second performance of its production of Mozart's ''Idomeneo,'' canceled in November out of fears arising from a scene showing the severed head of the Prophet Muhammad, The Associated Press reported. At the protest on Friday the demonstrators, above, prayed and displayed a green Islamic banner inscribed in Arabic with what they said was a Muslim expression of faith. ''Islam is for freedom, but we are against this insult,'' said Yusuf Oezgoez, a Turkish-born resident of Berlin. Marcel Kuhlmey, a Berlin police spokesman, said, ''There have been absolutely no threats, nothing.'' Spectators greeted the controversial scene, including the severed heads of Jesus, Buddha and the pagan sea god Poseidon, with applause, and one woman laughed. In contrast to a near sellout for the first performance, on Dec. 18, 1,355 tickets out of a possible total of more than 1,800 were sold for the second.\nMoretti Quits Turin Festival\nTwo days after being named artistic director of the Turin Film Festival, the Italian director Nanni Moretti quit, The Associated Press reported. Quoting a statement carried by the Italian news agency ANSA, it said that Mr. Moretti, left, had cited ''an atmosphere of tension'' that arose when some festival organizers objected after he was chosen on Wednesday. Mr. Moretti said, ''There has been talk of organizing two competing festivals in the same city; someone suggested a lack of ethics; and some have even said that I would be an instrument for politicians to strangle the festival's independence.'' He continued, ''With great pain I give up the job and leave you to your method problems, procedural disputes, personal grudges.'' Organizers could not be reached for immediate comment. The appointment of Mr. Moretti, who won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2001 for ''The Son's Room,'' had been seen as a move to invigorate the Turin festival, which spotlights young directors and independent films from around the world.\n'Museum' Admissions Lead the Way\nHoliday moviegoers in search of laughs and inspiration kept ''Night at the Museum'' (Fox) and ''The Pursuit of Happyness'' (Sony) in the top spots at American box offices over the weekend. ''Night at the Museum,'' the comedy starring Ben Stiller as a museum guard, pulled in $37.8 million in its second week in release to reach a total of $116.8 million, according to estimates by the box-office tracking company Screenline. ''The Pursuit of Happyness,'' the up-from-poverty story starring Will Smith, attracted $19.3 million in its third week. The newcomer to the Top 5 was the musical ''Dreamgirls'' (Paramount), moving into wide release in its third week and drawing $15.5 million to take third place. Fourth place went to ''Charlotte's Web'' (Paramount), based on E. B. White's pig-and-spider tale, with $12 million in its third week; and fifth place and $11.3 million went to ''Rocky Balboa'' (Sony-MGM), in the second week of the latest slugfest in the career of Sylvester Stallone.\nA Court Date For George Michael\nGeorge Michael, charged with driving while in an unfit condition, has a date with a magistrate on Jan. 11, Agence France-Presse reported. The charge grew out of his arrest in London on Oct. 2, when motorists called the police to report that Mr. Michael was causing an obstruction at traffic lights. Mr. Michael, 43, the former Wham! frontman whose real name is Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou, was found slumped over the steering wheel of his car and was arrested on suspicion of being unfit to drive and possession of what was said to be marijuana. Mr. Michael was found in a similar state at the wheel of his car in February, when he was cautioned for possessing marijuana.\nU2 Ponders New Direction\nU2 may be plotting a course change. At least it looks that way, according to Bono, its frontman, Reuters reported. ''Our band has certainly reached the end of where we've been at for the last couple of albums,'' he said in a BBC Radio interview. ''I want to see what else we can do with it, take it to the next level. I think that's what we've got to do.'' Asked if he planned a move from rock 'n' roll, he said: ''We're going to continue to be a band, but maybe the rock will have to go; maybe the rock has to get harder. But whatever it is, it's not going to stay where it is.'' He added that he would like U2 to explore compositions that feature just voice and acoustic guitar. ''I would like to do a couple of tunes in that direction,'' he said. ''I'd like to strip things down. That's something I'd be very interested in at the moment.'' The band is expected to go to work on a new album soon and plans to release it this year. Discussing the recently released compilation ''U218 Singles,'' including two new songs, he said: 'We've never been much of a singles band. But we did it because we have a very young audience coming through, and we wanted to, you know, just be very available for people who want to check us out, you know.''\nIndiana Jones Is Back\nWhat has Indiana Jones been up to since his last adventure 18 years ago? Moviegoers will find out in May 2008, when the filmmakers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg plan to bring to the screen the fourth chapter in the career of the intrepid archaeologist, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Lucas, above left, said he and Mr. Spielberg had recently signed off on the script for the film, which will once again star Harrison Ford, above right, now 64, who said in Rome in October that he was ''fit to continue'' to play the title role. Not surprisingly Mr. Lucas, who spoke while preparing for his duties as grand marshal today in the Rose Parade, said: ''It's going to be fantastic. It's going to be the best one yet.'' But he did not divulge details of the plot of the film, in development for more than a decade and scheduled to go before the cameras this year in locations that include Los Angeles. Previous Indiana Jones adventures were ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' (1981), ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' (1984) and ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' (1989).\nFootnotes\n''Tea and Sympathy,'' the Robert Anderson play about a lonely, misunderstood boarding-school boy that opened on Broadway in 1953 and ran for more than 700 performances, will be revived by the Keen Company as the final production of its season. Previews begin on March 6, with an official opening scheduled for March 15. The limited engagement runs through April 14 at the Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton.

1815750	Critic's Choice	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E1D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	David Banner ''Spare Clips: The Mixtape'' (B.I.G.F.A.C.E.)\nHe is a first-rate roarer, an accomplished producer, a proud Mississippian, a budding actor, an energetic philanthropist and a former president of the Student Government Association at Southern University, in Baton Rouge, La. Despite all this David Banner can't -- yet -- consider himself an A-list hip-hop star. And since the release of his not-quite-convincing 2005 album, ''Certified'' (SRC/Universal), he has kept a pretty low profile.\nNow he's back with a new mixtape, ''Spare Clips,'' which provides welcome proof that he hasn't given up. Proof too that he remains as unpredictable as ever. In one half-sung, half-snarled diatribe, he proclaims, ''With my Bible in my other hand/Screaming, 'Lord, I don't really wanna kill a man'/But they gon' make me come out of mine/Poppin' and bustin' my nine.'' Soon he switches directions again, pausing for a historical reminder -- ''Black folks hung from these trees'' -- before blasting away at his detractors.\nSome of these tracks have appeared elsewhere; one, the Pimp C collaboration ''Get Crunk,'' comes from the 1999 album that David Banner released as part of the group Crooked Lettaz. And there's a thumping remix of ''Ain't Got Nothing,'' about conspicuous nonconsumption, from ''Certified.''\nMost of the time David Banner (whose real name, Lavell Crump, may be even better than his stage name) would rather sound fierce, or earnest, than slick. That explains the rough-and-tumble appeal of his CDs, including this one; it also helps explain why more listeners haven't embraced them. But his raucous, synthesizer-driven beats may yet win him wider recognition. His production credits include ''Rubberband Man,'' a breakthrough single for T.I. And this mixtape includes a glorious track David Banner recently cooked up for Snoop Dogg and his Dogg Pound. ''Gimme some of that Mississippi, that jungle music, cuz,'' says Snoop Dogg, and David Banner does precisely that.\nHyphy Hitz (TVT)\nHyphy didn't quite break in 2006. But hyphy, the exuberant form of hip-hop native to the Bay Area, was more visible than ever. E-40, a hyphy godfather (though his extraordinary career predates hyphy), scored both a hip-hop hit (''Tell Me When to Go'') and a pop hit (''U and Dat''). And ghost riding -- in which a driver leaves his seat to pose alongside his moving car, or on top of it -- threatened to go from a semi-secret Bay Area tradition to a tabloid sensation; last month The Associated Press reported that a man had been killed in a ghost-riding accident in Stockton, Calif.\nStill, with the exception of E-40 (whose album has been a modest hit), Bay Area hip-hop has remained mainly underground. The year's best hyphy CD, ''The Slapp Addict'' (Slapp Addict Productions), was a compilation by the San Jose producer Traxamillion; it sneaked into (some) stores with scarcely any promotion.\nListeners wondering what they've been missing could do worse than to buy ''Hyphy Hitz,'' a scattershot compilation that gathers some of the scene's biggest names and tracks. And while there are some puzzling choices (most notably the inclusion of Da Muzicianz and Twisted Black, two TVT Records acts from Georgia and Texas, respectively), this CD captures hyphy's flamboyant appeal pretty well. The playful pioneer Mac Dre (who was shot and killed in 2004) and the croaky veteran Keak da Sneak (who popularized the term ''hyphy'') show up, and so do younger acts like DB'z (whose ''Stewy'' is partly a tribute to ''Family Guy'') and Dem Hoodstarz (who contribute an all-star remix of ''Getz Ya Grown Man On.'') While the basics of hyphy -- sparse 1980s-inspired beats, zooming bass lines, cheerful chants -- seem pretty cartoonish, successful subgenres have been built on far flimsier foundations. One of the best tracks, ''Super Sic Wit It,'' features Mistah F.A.B. and Turf Talk, both of whom have eagerly anticipated CDs due this year; that's reason enough to be hopeful for hyphy's future.\nBeirut ''Lon Gisland'' (Ba Da Bing)\nIn May an indie-rock band named Beirut released an odd and sometimes excellent album called ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing). Beirut is the project of Zach Condon, a young singer-songwriter who is evidently obsessed with Balkan brass bands; the CD, which ranged from crooned laments to ragtag celebrations, turned Mr. Condon's band into an indie sensation, not least because the whole thing seemed so improbable. For the album's European release Mr. Condon recorded enough material for a short bonus disc, ''The Lon Gisland EP,'' which is now available in the United States. (The CD is coming soon; a vinyl version, from Chouette, and a digital version are currently available.)\nThe highlight of ''Lon Gisland'' is ''Scenic World,'' a grander and handsomer version of perhaps the most infectious song from ''Gulag Orkestar''; the tinny keyboard ostinato is now a slightly less tinny accordion ostinato. There are four other songs, including ''Carousel,'' a dolorous and woozy waltz that tells fans the one thing they have been waiting to hear: ''Gulag Orkestar'' was no fluke.\nCritics Choice

Earlier in the show the band covered Cream, Jimi Hendrix, Willie Dixon (by way of Howlin' Wolf) and Little Milton (via Jerry Garcia). A James Brown jam was offered in tribute. A Stevie Wonder vamp cropped up in a Mahavishnu Orchestra tune. And during John Fogerty's ''Effigy'' there were quotations of Johnny Cash songs.\nThat clutter of references does a decent job of summing up Gov't Mule, a jam band with more than a casual investment in classic rock, soul and the blues. The Friday concert, the first in a three-night run, was typical: a seesaw of dense, hard riffs and rambling digressions. Along the way there was room for original tunes spanning the group's 11-year recording career. (It helps that the concert lasted well over three hours.)\nThe originals -- and, for that matter, the array of influences -- came courtesy of Warren Haynes, Gov't Mule's lead singer and guitarist. Mr. Haynes hails from a Southern-rock tradition of shaggy virtuosity. And as he regularly does as a guitarist in the Allman Brothers Band, which has also been known to set up shop at the Beacon, he galvanized. It was unmistakably his show, despite the reliable cohesion of his band.\nAs a singer he makes ample use of a bluesy rasp, flexing it to fit whatever dynamic the music demands. So he was convincingly sweet-tempered on ''Hide Your Love Away,'' one of the Beatles songs. Elsewhere he mostly howled.\nOn ''Brand New Angel,'' a psychedelic tune from ''High and Mighty,'' Gov't Mule's latest album, his harnessed rage made the chorus sound like something by Soundgarden. Then came ''Mr. High & Mighty,'' the album's lead track: the juicy hard-rock riff, coupled with a strained vocal, evoked vintage AC/DC. It's probably not a good thing that the originals weren't much more original than the covers, but Mr. Haynes made that seem forgivable.\nThe guitar playing helped. Most of his solos evolved from choice single notes to an ecstatic strumming wail, producing a sense of tension and drama. And his rapport with the drummer Matt Abts, the keyboardist Danny Louis and the bassist Andy Hess felt rewardingly deep. But because Mr. Haynes went long on every tune, tedium occasionally set in.\nSo it was a relief when Mr. Haynes brought on other guitarists as foils: the versatile Jimmy Vivino on several tunes, as well as Cesar Rojas and David Hidalgo, both members of the veteran Los Angeles band Los Lobos. Nobody posed a serious challenge to Mr. Haynes, but they all nudged him in productive ways.\nAs an opener Los Lobos provided an interesting contrast to Gov't Mule. Los Lobos drew heavily from their recent album ''The Town and the City'' and leaned on a smoldering sort of atmosphere. Mr. Hidalgo and Mr. Rojas took turns soloing and singing; there was no obvious star in the ranks.\nLos Lobos' set was far less dynamic than Gov't Mule's, and not nearly as free-flowing. But as the irresistible groove of ''Chuco's Cumbia'' segued into the sinuous meditation of ''The Valley,'' a nifty spell was cast. Los Lobos had a perspective, and a sound, to call its own.\nThen again they seemed to have the most fun on a cover of Buddy Holly's ''Not Fade Away.'' And that was after Mr. Haynes had joined them onstage.\nMUSIC REVIEW\nCorrection: January 9, 2007, Tuesday A music review on Jan. 1 about Gov't Mule and Los Lobos, at the Beacon Theater, misstated the surname of a member of Los Lobos. He is Cesar Rosas, not Rojas.

HarperSanFrancisco. $24.95.\nAs a child Amy-Jill Levine insisted on attending catechism class at a Catholic church. She faithfully administered Holy Communion to her Barbie doll. This, despite being, then as now, an observant Jew. A professor of New Testament studies at Vanderbilt Divinity School, Ms. Levine has spent a lifetime exploring the profound connections and equally profound divisions between Christianity and Judaism -- and, perhaps more important, between Christians and Jews.\nThe premise of ''The Misunderstood Jew: The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus'' is simple: Jews and Christians need to understand one another. The implicit corollary: Despite years of trying, and to their mutual harm, they do not.\nIn a book intended for Jews and Christians alike (but mostly addressed to Christians) Ms. Levine offers both critique and corrective on topics as seemingly disparate as the Jewish content of the Lord's Prayer and Christian responses to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But that is Ms. Levine's point: to show how frequently and disastrously inaccurate beliefs about Jesus and early Judaism produce distorted relationships in the present.\nHer first chapters, devoted to the Jewish Jesus and the New Testament, are the least satisfying. In the interests of educating her reader about Judaism in both the first century and the 21st, she moves somewhat erratically between the two eras.\nA discussion of Jesus' views on the Sabbath begins with a modern Jewish view of the Sabbath before considering the roots of this view in the Torah, and she discusses how the Christian celebration of Sabbath on Sunday rather than Saturday changes its symbolic import, before returning to Jesus and his first-century context. The information is valuable but might be more edifying, especially for the nonspecialists who form the book's primary audience, if the shifting time frame were less distracting.\nMs. Levine's reconstructions of first-century Judaism are corrective in some places but elsewhere simply repeat unhelpful truisms. For example, she uncritically takes rabbinic writings as representing the ''majority'' view among first-century Jews, despite growing scholarly rejection of this stance. Similarly, Paul's belief that Jesus' blood atoned for human sin is described as unprecedented and ''off-putting'' for Jews. Certainly, blood atonement is off-putting for most modern Jews, but in some ancient Jewish contexts it was standard fare, as evidenced by repeated claims in 2 and 4 Maccabees that the blood of Jewish martyrs atoned for the sins of the people.\nMs. Levine's perpetuation of some anachronistic readings, however, confirms her larger point: Our received assumptions about what Jesus (and Paul) meant in their original settings are deeply entrenched, often serving agendas of which we are not even aware. She is on a surer footing when she addresses the question of anti-Judaism within the New Testament. Three extremely painful texts -- 1 Thessalonians 2:14-15, with its claim that the Jews killed Jesus; Matthew 27:25, in which the Jews call for Jesus' blood upon themselves and their children; and John 8:44, in which Jesus labels the Jews ''children of the Devil'' -- suffice to demonstrate that regardless of authorial intent or historical context, the plain meaning of the New Testament is often virulently anti-Jewish.\nIn such instances historical context becomes irrelevant; the problem will not be solved by more or better scholarship. Rather, the problem can be addressed only by those who read these texts as Scripture: ''Christians must denounce anti-Jewish readings.'' What Ms. Levine finds, however, is that even theologically educated and well-meaning Christians frequently don't denounce such readings, but instead either deny their anti-Jewish content (here the Pontifical Biblical Commission comes in for special criticism) or, often unwittingly, replicate it.\nMs. Levine's documentation of the insouciance with which liberal Christians slander Jews and Judaism is perhaps the book's most important contribution. She cites numerous examples of contemporary scholars, particularly theologians of liberation, who first ''invent a bad Judaism'' and then ''explain how Jesus abrogates this bad system.'' In her most outrageous example, Jesus' crucifixion is said to mark the ''triumph of the patriarchal god of Judaism.''\nMany of the works Ms. Levine cites were published by the World Council of Churches, a group committed to overcoming anti-Semitism. How can well-meaning Christians perpetuate such theological abomination? Mostly, argues Ms. Levine, through sloppy scholarship and lazy reading.\nChristian seminarians are taught little about Judaism, either ancient or modern (Judaism does not count as a ''different'' tradition in many programs that require study of a non-Christian tradition), and so look to the only ''Jews'' available -- the Israelites of the Old Testament -- for a model of what Jews do and believe. First-century Jews are seen either as figures transplanted from the Old Testament or as practitioners of a ''late Judaism'' that has corrupted Old Testament ideals. Modern Jews, in turn, embody the already-fossilized religion practiced by Jesus' first-century enemies.\nWithin this limited horizon Jesus can only be defined against the Judaism of his day rather than within it. Hence Ms. Levine's concern ''to see Jesus as a Jew who made sense to other Jews in a Jewish context,'' ultimately allowing him to become ''a bridge,'' spanning the gap between modern Jews and Christians.\nJewish-Christian dialogue, having come into its own in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has seemed less compelling in recent decades. Ms. Levine's chilling tales of casual anti-Judaism among scholars who should know better rekindles the urgency of the task. She covers a vast canvas and of necessity does so in broad strokes, some more effective than others. But it is a book whose strengths far outweigh its flaws, and whose flaws count only because its subject matters so deeply.\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES Julie Galambush is associate professor of religious studies at the College of William and Mary.

1815754	Disney Plans to Introduce a Sleek Makeover of Disney.com Site	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	When the Walt Disney Company's chief executive, Robert A. Iger, takes the stage at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Jan. 8, he is expected to introduce the new Disney.com Web site that has taken more than a year to redesign.\nFor years Disney's Web sites, which include the popular ESPN.com, ABC.com and Disney.com, have been among the Internet's most visited. In November, the company overall ranked No. 9 among sites visited at home and work, according to Nielsen Netratings, which tracks online traffic.\nBut critics of the Disney.com, the homepage for a lot of the company's online offerings, say it looks amateurish and is hard to navigate. Disney recently showed off the revamped Web site at a company meeting at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.\nSome executives who saw it said it was much improved, with video and interactive features, and was much sleeker than its clumsy predecessor.\nRevamping Disney.com has been a No. 1 priority for Mr. Iger, who has sought to extend the Disney brand by embracing new digital media. But behind the revamping, analysts and others say there is an equally pressing issue facing Mr. Iger, one that many entertainment conglomerates may face in the coming years: Who should be running the company's Internet properties?\nIn the past, Disney executives have bristled at the influence Disney's Internet Group, which oversees most of the company's online ventures, exerted over film, television and theme park Internet operations. Executives wanted more authority over their own online creative ventures.\nIt is not the first time Mr. Iger has grappled with how much autonomy executives should have. In 2005, he disbanded the company's unpopular strategic planning unit, giving more power to the company's individual units.\n''It's inevitable that each division will be in the Internet space,'' said Harold L. Vogel, a media analyst. ''I don't detect that Disney has resolved this. Someone is going to have to coordinate and, at the same time, not quash the creative side. I'm sure there will be political fights over this constantly. It will happen at every media company.''\nAt Disney, the Internet Group is run by a company veteran, Steve Wadsworth. Currently, division executives are expected to work closely with Mr. Wadsworth and his team in developing new ideas for their division's online ventures, including those for theme parks, ABC.com and ESPN.com. Mr. Wadsworth first joined Disney Online in 1995, having spent two years in the consumer products division.\nChristopher Dixon, managing director at the investment firm GGCP. who has followed Disney for years, suggested a ''structural overhaul'' of the group, giving the division heads greater control. ''The Internet Group needs to set technical standards, be a facilitator,'' said Mr. Dixon. ''One person can't do it all.''\nA spokesman for Mr. Wadsworth said neither he nor the executive overseeing Disney.com's revamping, Paul Yanover, were available to comment because they were on vacation. Mr. Yanover is a Disney veteran who was hired last May from Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Online, which he headed and helped develop e-commerce business for the company's theme parks. The spokesman said Mr. Iger was unavailable.\nSince 1999, Mr. Wadsworth has had direct oversight of several online sites including Disney.com, FamilyFun.com and Movies.com, as well as Disney's mobile phone ventures. Mr. Iger told investors at a conference recently that it could take three to five years for the company's recent investments in Internet video and mobile devices to show significant profit, despite its promise.\nDisney Online, which Mr. Wadsworth oversees, was founded in 1995 and includes a cadre of games like the highly successful Toontown Online and Pirates of the Caribbean Online, which will be released in 2007. In 2005 it introduced Disney's Game Café for adults.\nIn addition to its own operations, the Internet Group is expected to consult with the divisions on major strategic initiatives. And that has caused tension as executives seek to more seamlessly integrate the Internet into their traditional businesses, said Disney executives who asked not to be named because of their relationship with the Internet Group. ESPN.com was created in 1995, the same year as Disney.com. Many within Disney consider ESPN.com to be a far superior Web site because of strong oversight from ESPN's management team. As a result, said one of the executives, ESPN.com seeks to operate with little interference.\nLast year, the Disney-ABC Television Group appointed Albert Cheng to head a newly formed digital media team and charged him with creating new business ventures for ABC's online unit. He reports to Anne Sweeney, co-chairman of Disney Media Networks, who negotiated with Apple Computer to sell popular ABC television shows like ''Desperate Housewives'' on iTunes.\nThat venture has proved most successful. Not only did other networks follow suit, but ABC has expanded the number of shows available on iTunes while offering ad-supported Disney shows for free on ABC's Web site.\nIn November, Walt Disney Studios hired a new technology officer to help it, among other things, deliver Disney movies online. Studio executives are hoping for more oversight of movie properties, including online movie distribution at home which has the potential for big profits.\n''That is the holy grail,'' said Mr. Dixon, particularly given Apple's interest in in-home entertainment. Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, is now Disney's largest investor after Disney's $7.4 billion acquisition of Pixar Animation Studios, formerly owned by Apple.\nEarlier this year, Mr. Iger considered combining all of Disney's online games and video game operations -- some of which are overseen by the Internet group -- within Disney's consumer products division. The consumer products team has been aggressive in expanding its video game operations and has sought to bring the company's expertise under one roof. Games are a priority for Mr. Iger; Disney has acquired small game makers to create Disney-branded content, instead of simply licensing popular titles.\nMr. Iger decided to allow the online game business developed by the Internet Group to remain there, instead of combining it in the consumer products division. Mr. Vogel, the media analyst, said there was a case for keeping it separate, although in the long run it might be better if they were a single unit. For Mr. Dixon, of GGCP, it is not whether Disney can best exploit the Disney franchises through Disney.com, but when and how it will actually happen.\n''The irony is they have all the pieces,'' he said. ''They now just have to figure out the next phase.''\nCorrection: January 10, 2007, Wednesday Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Jan. 1 about plans by the Walt Disney Company to introduce a revamped Web site at the Consumer Electronics Show referred incorrectly to the business relationship between Apple and Pixar Animation Studios. While Apple's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, was once the majority shareholder in Pixar, Apple never owned the animation studio.

Last year, they were the third most shoplifted category, after meat and analgesics.\nThe decline partly reflects increased security for pseudoephedrine, a decongestant that can be used to make the drug methamphetamine. By the end of 2005, 34 states had passed laws restricting sales of medicines with the chemical, and often requiring stores to keep them under lock and key.\nThe report also suggested that self-service checkout lanes, where customers scan and pay for their purchases themselves, are surprisingly theft-free. Of the roughly 5,400 stores in the survey with self-checkout lanes, 63.6 percent reported no increase in theft rates.\n''Individuals in the self-checkout lane, they think they're being watched more than ever before, and they probably are,'' said Wayne Breckenridge, director of education for the Food Marketing Institute.\nALEX MINDLIN\nDRILLING DOWN
1815756	Loaded With Personalities, Now Satellite Radio May Try a Merger	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E0D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Last year's debut of Howard Stern's radio show on Sirius Satellite Radio put the technology on the map, raising the public's awareness of satellite radio and helping to boost significantly subscriber totals for Sirius and its larger rival, XM Satellite Radio.\nToday, thanks in part to the outsize radio personality, the Stern Effect has increased Sirius's base to about six million subscribers, up 80 percent from one year ago. XM has increased its numbers by more than 30 percent, ending 2006 with 7.7 to 7.9 million customers.\n''There is a tendency to view satellite radio as if the glass is half empty, and that it is a failure or disappointment,'' said Craig Moffett, senior cable analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.\n''In fact, nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said. ''Satellite radio is growing faster than any consumer product except for the iPod.''\nBut Sirius and XM shares have taken a battering on Wall Street, with prices for both off about 50 percent from their year-ago levels. On Friday, Sirius closed at $3.54, while XM ended the year at $14.45.\nAnd now, the industry may be getting ready to try an even more dramatic third act -- a possible attempt to merge the two services.\nThe benefits of a merger have been promoted by the chief executive of Sirius, Mel Karmazin, for a number of months, and Sirius officials continue to say that a merger would be a good thing. XM has not commented on the possibility, and neither company has said whether they have actually discussed the issue.\n''When you have two companies in the same industry, we have a similar cost structure. Clearly, a merger makes sense from an investor's point of view to reduce costs, and to have a better return,'' said David Frear, the chief financial officer for Sirius.\nBoth companies have continued to lose hundreds of millions of dollars because of marketing and other subscriber acquisition expenses. During the year, XM sharply lowered its expectations for 2006 subscriber levels, from January's predicted end-of-year total of 9 million to a maximum of 7.9 million. (Sirius reduced its subscription projection by about 100,000.)\nNate Davis, XM's president, said his company believed that the slower-than-expected growth rate was of its own making and not a result of any market indifference. ''We did not stimulate the market with new products,'' he said.\nXM's most talked-about receivers, the Pioneer Inno and Samsung Helix, were first announced one year ago. Several new receiver models will be introduced later in 2007. In addition, production of some receivers was temporarily halted to stop a condition that was allowing satellite signals to be picked up by neighboring vehicles.\nThe hiccups typical of fledgling industries appear to be over. Both companies have their programming lineups largely in place and a wide range of receivers available in retail stores.\nIn addition to Howard Stern, Sirius features personalities like Deepak Chopra, Judith Regan, Richard Simmons and Martha Stewart. Sports programming includes N.B.A., N.F.L., and N.H.L. games; Nascar programming begins this year.\nXM has shows with hosts including Bob Dylan, Ellen Degeneres, ''Good Morning America'' personalities, and Oprah Winfrey. XM broadcasts every Major League Baseball game as well as P.G.A. golf.\nYet the vast majority of programming remains duplicative. Each company offers a wide variety of rock, pop, folk, and other musical genres, as well as the same news channels, which include the BBC, CNN, Fox, and MSNBC. Sirius and XM each claim that their music channels are more compelling than the competition's, but most casual listeners would be hard-pressed to tell the difference.\n''The services mirror each other tremendously,'' said Richard Doherty, an analyst with the Envisioneering Group, a research firm. ''More people know that one service has Howard Stern than know which one has him.''\nExcept for a relatively small handful of viewers looking for particular programs, consumers searching for a satellite service in a retail store often make their decision not on the merits of one over the other, but which one is more convenient to buy.\n''For the subscriber, it all comes down to which one of the two is closer to the cash register. Customers cannot tell the difference between the two services,'' Mr. Moffett said.\nCustomer choice will play an even smaller role in the coming years as both companies come to rely more on selling satellite radio as a factory-installed option on new cars, and less on receivers sold at retail stores.\nBoth companies have exclusive agreements with the automobile companies. Customers typically get free service for a number of months, and then must pay $12.95 a month to continue listening.\nXM has exclusive arrangements with General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan and Porsche. Sirius has similar alliances with BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford, Kia and VW-Audi.\nToday, about 63 percent of XM's subscribers are buyers of new cars, and Sirius's new subscribers are derived equally from new car and after-market sales. As more cars are equipped with satellite radios, the new car market could grow to as high as 70 percent of sales in the next few years, Mr. Moffett said.\n''We see greater and greater demand in the car market,'' said Mr. Davis of XM. ''And we think the used car market will be an opportunity to sell to new subscribers.'' Used car subscribers incur no additional hardware costs if the receiver is already in place.\nAnd if the companies were to merge and effectively double their subscriber base, the new company could reduce programming costs through increased negotiating clout, removal of duplicative channels and elimination of redundant employees.\nWhether Sirius and XM attempt to merge, a number of variables that will determine the size of the industry's success remain unknown.\nThey include the number of new cars that will be equipped with satellite radio receivers; the percentage of new car owners who will subscribe after the free trial period ends; and whether purchasers of used cars equipped with satellite radio will be more or less likely to subscribe than new car owners.\nThe business may also be vulnerable to subscription overload, Mr. Doherty said, if consumers find that monthly recurring expenses from cellphone bills, cable TV, and other services are too high.\nYet even if that is true, there is little doubt that the concept of satellite radio is no longer alien to consumers.

1815757	The Sleepy Subject of Canada's Grain Exports Perks Up	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E0D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The business of grain marketing has not been its usual sleepy self lately in Western Canada.\nPlans by the government to strip the Canadian Wheat Board of its monopoly control over most of the country's wheat and barley exports have provoked a fight that is pitting farmer against farmer and the agency against the government.\nThe wheat board, founded 75 years ago as part of a wave of cooperative ventures for improving farmers' lives, is now one of the world's largest grain traders, with annual sales of $4 billion to $6 billion.\nThe board is, in many respects, among the last of the cooperative projects that remains true to its original goals. But those goals now have little in common with the open market philosophy of the minority Conservative government that came to power just under a year ago.\nShortly before Christmas, that clash resulted in an unusual cabinet order to fire the wheat board's president, Adrian Measner.\nThe fate of the board will be eagerly awaited in the United States, where farm groups have unsuccessfully challenged the Canadian board's monopoly. Among the companies likely to move into Canada's export market, if it is opened, are commercial grain traders like Cargill of Minneapolis and Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill.\n''There is absolutely no doubt that part of the reason the Conservative government is pushing as hard as it is pushing is, I suspect, that they are feeling pressure from the Americans,'' said Murray Fulton, an agriculture economist who directs a center for the study of cooperatives at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.\nThe wheat board concept is simple. In exchange for its monopoly over wheat destined for export from Canada's three prairie provinces, as well as a small part of British Columbia, it pays every farmer the same average sale price. Overall, Professor Fulton said, price averaging has provided most farmers with greater stability and higher prices than they would have obtained in an open market.\nA study commissioned by the wheat board on barley prices released in December gives more specifics. The report, by Richard S. Gray of the University of Saskatchewan, Andrew Schmitz of the University of Florida and Troy G. Schmitz at Arizona State University, concluded that farmers' barley revenue from the wheat board was 59 million Canadian dollars higher from 1995 to 2004 than it would have been in an open market system.\nWheat board supporters argue that the board also helps farmers by negotiating terms with railways and ports.\nThe system seems to have supporters on the buyers' side as well. It provides a more uniform grading of grains than is available in the United States, for instance.\nBut averaging prices has a significant drawback for some farmers. By definition, an average price is often lower than what individual farmers who live near the United States border could obtain by directly trucking their harvest south. The province of Alberta, home to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, has long opposed the board for that reason, among others.\nChuck Strahl, the minister of agriculture, has repeatedly said that all he wants is to give farmers the choice of pooling their risk through the wheat board or going out on their own.\n''We are trying to get more marketing choice for farmers,'' he told the House of Commons in December. ''We want to put more money in their pockets. We want them to take advantage of their own expertise.''\nProfessor Fulton argued in a separate study published last month that the wheat board cannot survive in an open market. Indeed, its history before it was granted a monopoly supports that idea. The operation floundered as farmers chose the open market when prices were high, returning to the board only during hard times.\nMr. Strahl has not found it easy to end the board's monopoly. A 1998 law gave farmers control of the board by letting them directly elect 10 of its 15 directors, with the balance, including the president, being appointed by the government.\n(Because the government guarantees the board's finances, however, it retained the power to issue cabinet orders.)\nThe Conservatives, in the minority, have been unable to get any of the other parties to support changes in the wheat board. An attempt earlier this year to amend the board's legislation was resoundingly defeated by opposition parties.\nAnd when five wheat board positions came up for election this fall, the government heavily promoted candidates who backed its plan. Farmers, however, responded by electing four candidates who favor the current monopoly.\nNow Mr. Strahl plans a vote on creating an open barley market early in 2007. But he has also made it clear that the government will not be bound by its results.\nThe level of support for the government's open market plan is unclear. Even Mr. Strahl said during recent committee testimony: ''I think I've had 4,500 letters on wheat board issues since I've been in office. They are almost equally divided.''\nMr. Measner, a 34-year veteran of the wheat board, had become something of a minor celebrity by rebuffing orders from Mr. Strahl and his staff to stop promoting the monopoly system and start backing the government's plan.\nBefore his dismissal on Dec. 22, Mr. Measner began a court challenge of a cabinet order requiring the board to support the government, arguing that it is unconstitutional and outside the government's power over the board.\n''The government has a direction they're taking the wheat board, and it doesn't matter what people say or what people want,'' Mr. Measner said in an interview from his home after his firing. ''My position is that it should be farmers making the decision.''\nKen Ritter, a farmer from Saskatchewan who is the board's chairman, said the legal challenge of the government's orders will continue as will the board's campaign to keep the current system.\n''This is very, very divisive,'' Mr. Ritter said. ''This has gone on for 40 years.''\nProfessor Fulton said that by firing Mr. Measner and attempting to gag the board, the government runs the danger of alienating even some of the farmers who back its open market position.\n''The view seems to be shifting,'' Professor Fulton said. ''Even farmers who might support a change in the wheat board are saying, why do it this way?''
1815758	Studios' DVDs Face a Crack In Security	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E0D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	An anonymous computer programmer may have skewed the competition over standards for high-definition DVD discs by possibly defeating a scheme that both sides use to protect digital content.\nThe standards, HD-DVD and Blu-ray, are being backed by rival coalitions of Hollywood studios and consumer electronics and computer companies that are eagerly marketing a new generation of digital media players and video game machines tailored for widescreen TVs.\nThe HD-DVD coalition includes companies like Microsoft, Intel, Toshiba and NEC; the Blu-ray camp has Sony, Philips and Samsung. Among studios, Universal is exclusively backing HD-DVD. Paramount and Warner Brothers also support HD-DVD, but not exclusively. Representatives of Walt Disney, 20th Century Fox and Warner Brothers are on the board of the Blu-ray group.\nThe two groups have taken different technical approaches in their efforts to prohibit consumers from making copies of movies and other digital material stored on discs. Both groups use an encryption scheme known as Advanced Access Copy System. The Blu-ray system also adds a software-based component that makes it possible to modify the copy protection scheme on new discs if the old one is broken by hackers.\nThe standards are brand new, but it appears that the two groups' copy protection schemes are already about to be tested.\nThe HD-DVD camp may have suffered a setback when the programmer, who identified himself as Muslix64, announced in the Internet discussion forum Doom9 on Dec. 18 that he had successfully copied movies distributed in the HD-DVD format. The note directed readers to a site where demonstration software he had written could be downloaded.\n''I was not aware of anyone having done that, so I did,'' he wrote.\nIn an accompanying video demonstration posted on the YouTube Web site, the programmer showed encryption keys for six movies and concluded by stating ''A.A.C.S. is unbreakable? I don't think so. Do you? Stay tuned for source code in January. Merry Christmas.''\nBecause the encryption system has a hierarchy of encryption keys, simply breaking the system for a single movie does not mean that it is possible to copy all movies.\nTechnical experts who have examined the software posted by Muslix64 said that it was only a partial solution for making copies of the digitally protected material, but that it did not bode well for the Advanced Access Content System.\n''They're playing with something that is incomplete, but it is still a troubling sign,'' said Richard Doherty, the president of Envisioneering, a consumer electronics industry consulting firm.\nThe programmer has said that he plans to post more software on Tuesday, describing a more complete attack on A.A.C.S.\nOn Friday, the industry group that is completing the A.A.C.S. protection standard issued a short statement saying that it was aware of the claims but had not yet verified them.\nIf the person who identified himself as Muslix64 is able to create a complete version of a decryption program, or if others extend the software so that consumers without technical expertise can readily make copies of movies, that would create a crisis for the HD-DVD camp. That system contains a ''revocation'' mechanism for shutting down HD-DVD players whose encryption system has been compromised. But industry analysts say that taking such a step would give the HD-DVD system a tremendous black eye, angering consumers and shaking the confidence of Hollywood studios in the system.\nToday's DVDs are protected using an earlier encryption technique known as Content Scramble System, or C.S.S. That system was undermined in 1999 by a small group of programmers, and movie studios have said that the new A.A.C.S. would not fall victim to the same kind of technological attack.\nThe Blu-ray system adds modifiable copy protection software, known as BD Plus, that is based on an approach pioneered by a group of technologists at Cryptography Research in San Francisco as a safeguard in the event the A.A.C.S. is compromised. Industry executives said that Microsoft opposed the Cryptography approach because it would shift control to the studio and away from hardware makers.\nIf the HD-DVD protection system has indeed been compromised, it was not immediately clear which camp would benefit most directly.\nSome posters in Internet discussion groups have argued that the cracking of HD-DVD may increase the popularity of the system among consumers eager to make copies of movies they have purchased.\nAt the same time, a weakened encryption system could undermine studio support, causing some to turn to the Blu-ray technology instead and giving the Blu-ray group an advantage in offering a wider range of content.
1815759	Something Wiki Is Coming To the Web Search Market	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The voluntary collaborative ''wiki'' model, which was marshaled to create the behemoth online encyclopedia Wikipedia, is being recruited for another challenge: to build a better search engine.\nThe project, called Wikiasari for now, was announced in December by Wikia, a for-profit company co-founded by Jimmy Wales, the former options trader who has been the public face of Wikipedia. Like Wikipedia, a wiki search engine would be based on the idea that volunteers can do the work of paid specialists -- in the case of search engines, the work of sophisticated computers that evaluate Web sites for relevance using secret criteria.\n''The one thing that I feel like I know how to do is build communities,'' Mr. Wales said. ''I mean it differently than the way it is often abused in the Internet community as feedback ratings. I mean people who know each other, who have discussions. In Wikipedia, there are discussions. We want to encourage that here.''\nThe Wikia search engine would allow users to see how the results were generated and modify those rankings using their own knowledge of the Internet. Any changes could be reversed by a different user, and, as in Wikipedia, long discussions could ensue over the decisions.\n''I suspect there is a need for categorization and grouping'' by the volunteers, Mr. Wales said. ''It would not make sense to have a dialogue for each long-tail search. For popular searches, it makes sense.''\n''The question is: Will there be a demand?'' he said. ''I think there will be. People are not happy with the lack of transparency.''\nGil Penchina, the chief executive of Wikia, compared the search-engine process to filtering spam.\n''Humans are pretty good at that; machines are not so good at that,'' he said. ''What is obvious to a person is not always obvious to a machine. There are all sorts of tricks to fool the search engines. We think that people are better than machines at making decisions about what are proper results for any search term you type in.''\nMr. Wales and Angela Beesley, a co-founder of Wikia, are pivoting from the nonprofit encyclopedia to the world of dot-com start-ups.\nMr. Penchina said that Wikia, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif., had raised $4 million from a group of investors, and that in December it had additionally received ''an undisclosed, significant cash investment'' from Amazon.com.\nAs for the idea of getting people to donate their work to a for-profit operation, Mr. Wales said, ''Part of the incentive problem is making it fun.''\nAs Wikia's profile increases, the officials of the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation -- which says it is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content -- say they are trying to make the distinctions between the two more clear. The foundation, ''was originally very related to Wikia,'' said Florence Devouard, who replaced Mr. Wales as chairman, in an e-mail message from France where she lives. And ''accordingly, in the past few months, we have worked on entirely separating the two entities.''\nAs for concerns that the Wikia search engine, perhaps with groupings and categories, could become more like a for-profit Wikipedia, Ms. Devouard said in the e-mail message that she was not worried.\n''There is already a Wikipedia and people aren't going to waste their time reinventing the wheel.''
1815760	Looking for the Next Google; Everybody Wants a Slice Of the Web Search Pie	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E0D91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	In brand-new offices with a still-empty game room and enough space to triple their staff of nearly 30, a trio of entrepreneurs is leading an Internet start-up with an improbable mission: to out-Google Google.\nThe three started Powerset, a company whose aim is to deliver better answers than any other search engine -- including Google -- by letting users type questions in plain English. And they have made believers of Silicon Valley investors whose fortunes turn on identifying the next big thing.\n''There's definitely a segment of the market that thinks we are crazy,'' said Charles Moldow, a partner at Foundation Capital, a venture capital firm that is Powerset's principal financial backer. ''In 2000, some people thought Google was crazy.''\nPowerset is hardly alone. Even as Google continues to outmaneuver its main search rivals, Yahoo and Microsoft, plenty of newcomers -- with names like hakia, ChaCha and Snap -- are trying to beat the company at its own game. And Wikia Inc., a company started by a founder of Wikipedia, plans to develop a search engine that, like the popular Web-based encyclopedia, would be built by a community of programmers and users.\nThese ambitious quests reflect the renewed optimism sweeping technology centers like Silicon Valley and fueling a nascent Internet boom. It also shows how much the new Internet economy resembles a planetary system where everything and everyone orbits around search in general, and around Google in particular.\nSilicon Valley is filled with start-ups whose main business proposition is to be bought by Google, or for that matter by Yahoo or Microsoft. Countless other start-ups rely on Google as their primary driver of traffic or on Google's powerful advertising system as their primary source of income. Virtually all new companies compete with Google for scarce engineering talent. And divining Google's next move has become a fixation for scores of technology blogs and a favorite parlor game among technology investors.\n''There is way too much obsession with search, as if it were the end of the world,'' said Esther Dyson, a well-known technology investor and forecaster. ''Google equals money equals search equals search advertising; it all gets combined as if this is the last great business model.''\nIt may not be the last great business model, but Google has proved that search linked to advertising is a very large and lucrative business, and everyone -- including Ms. Dyson, who invested a small sum in Powerset -- seems to want a piece of it.\nSince the beginning of 2004, venture capitalists have put nearly $350 million into no fewer than 79 start-ups that had something to do with Internet search, according to the National Venture Capital Association, an industry group.\nAn overwhelming majority are not trying to take Google head on, but rather are focusing on specialized slices of the search world, like searching for videos, blog postings or medical information. Since Google's stated mission is to organize all of the world's information, they may still find themselves in the search giant's cross hairs. That is not necessarily bad, as being acquired by Google could be a financial bonanza for some of these entrepreneurs and investors.\nBut in the current boom, there is money even for those with the audacious goal of becoming a better Google.\nPowerset recently received $12.5 million in financing. Hakia, which like Powerset is trying to create a ''natural language'' search engine, got $16 million. Another $16 million went to Snap, which has focused on presenting search results in a more compelling way and is experimenting with a new advertising model. And ChaCha, which uses paid researchers that act as virtual reference librarians to provide answers to users' queries, got $6.1 million.\nStill, recent history suggests that gaining traction is going to be difficult. Of dozens of search start-ups that were introduced in recent years, none had more than a 1 percent share of the United States search market in November, according to Nielsen NetRatings, a research firm that measures Internet traffic.\nAmassing a large audience has proved to be a challenge even for those with a track record and resources. Consider A9, a search engine owned by Amazon.com that received positive reviews when it began in 2004 and was run by Udi Manber, a widely recognized search specialist. Despite some innovative features and early successes, A9 has captured only a tiny share of the market. Mr. Manber now works for Google, where he is vice president of engineering.\nThe setback apparently has not stopped Amazon or its chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, from pursuing profits in search. ChaCha said it counts an investment company owned by Mr. Bezos among its backers, and Amazon is an investor in Wikia. An Amazon spokeswoman said Mr. Bezos does not comment about his personal investments.\nSome start-ups are similarly bullish. ''We expect to be one of the top three search engines,'' said Riza C. Berkan, the chief executive of hakia. It is a bold claim, given that hakia's technology is not yet ready for prime time, and Mr. Berkan readily concedes it will take time to perfect it.\nThe dream, however, is quintessential Silicon Valley.\n''It is hard for me to believe that anybody thinks they can take Google's business from Google,'' said Randy Komisar, a venture capitalist who was once known as Silicon Valley's ''virtual C.E.O.'' for his role as a mentor to scores of technology firms. ''But to call the game over because Google has been such a success would be to deny history.''\nIn some ways, the willingness of so many to make multimillion-dollar investments to take on Google and other search companies represents a startling change. In the late 1990s, when Microsoft dominated the technology world, inventors and investors did everything they could to avoid competing with the software company.\nYet many of today's search start-ups are putting themselves squarely in the path of the Google steamroller. Most explain that decision in similar ways.\nThey say that Google's dominance today is different from Microsoft's in the late 90s when its operating system was a virtual monopoly and nearly impossible to break. In the Internet search industry, ''you earn your right to be in business every day, page view after page view, click after click,'' said Barney Pell, a founder and the chief executive of Powerset, whose search service is not yet available.\nThey also say that the market for search simply is too large to resist. Google, which, according to Nielsen, handles about half of all Internet searches in the United States, is valued at an astonishing $141 billion. So, the reasoning goes, anyone who can grab even a small slice of the search market could be well rewarded.\n''You don't need to be No. 1 to be worth billions of dollars,'' said Allen Morgan, a partner at Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm that invested $10 million in Snap. The company is also backed by Bill Gross, an Internet financier who pioneered the idea of linking ads and search results, only to see Google seize the powerful business model and improve on it.\nAlmost all of today's search entrepreneurs also say that Google's success lends credibility to their own long-shot quest.\nWhen Lawrence Page and Sergey Brin first started tinkering with what would become Google, other search engines like AltaVista and Lycos and Excite were dominant. But the companies that owned them were distracted by efforts to diversify their businesses, and they took their eye off the ball of Internetsearch and stopped innovating.\nSome now say that search has not evolved much in years, and that Google is similarly distracted as it introduces new products like word processors, spreadsheets and online payment systems and expands into online video, social networking and other businesses.\n''The more Google starts to think about taking on Microsoft, the less it is a pure search play, and the more it opens the door for new innovations,'' said Mr. Moldow, the Foundation Capital partner. ''That's great for us.''\nBut at the same time, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft have thousands of engineers, including some of the world's top search specialists, working on improving their search results. And they have spent billions building vast computer networks so they can respond instantly to the endless stream of queries from around the world.\nSearch ''is becoming an increasingly capital-intensive business,'' said Marissa Mayer, Google's vice president for search. That makes it harder for start-ups to catch up to the giants, she said.\nThat is not stopping entrepreneurs from betting that they can. Powerset has search and natural-language experts among its two dozen employees, including former top engineers from Yahoo and a former chief linguist from Ask Jeeves, Ask.com's predecessor. They are the kind of people who could easily land jobs at Google or Microsoft or Yahoo.\nSteve Newcomb, a Powerset founder and veteran of several successful start-ups, said his company could become the next Google. Or, he said, if Google or someone else perfected natural-language search before Powerset, then his company would make a great acquisition for one of the other search companies. ''We are a huge story no matter what,'' he said.\nMs. Dyson, the technology commentator and Powerset investor, captured the optimism more concisely and with less swagger. ''I love Google,'' she said, ''but I love the march of history.''
1815761	At Sea With a Book to Read, And the Author of It, Too	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04EFD91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	As the Jewel of the Seas, a luxury cruise ship owned by Royal Caribbean, steamed down the coast toward Bermuda in late October, there were plenty of distractions, including two Olympic-size pools, Latin dance lessons and Boozer Bingo. But Birdie Jaworski was having none of it.\nMs. Jaworski, a single mother who sells Avon products in tiny Las Vegas, N.M., instead spent much of her time inside the ship's lounges and meeting rooms with other book enthusiasts, listening to authors like Elinor Lipman (''My Latest Grievance''), Terri Jentz (''Strange Piece of Paradise''), and Lynnette Khalfani (''The Money Coach's Guide to Your First Million'').\n''I was having so much fun hanging out with people with the same literary interests as me,'' said Ms. Jaworski, who runs a book club in her hometown and is herself an aspiring author.\nMs. Jaworski was one of about 150 book lovers aboard the ship for a five-day literary-themed cruise out of Boston. Known as Book It to Bermuda, it is just the latest example of a growing genre of cruises that could be called Ship Lit. Often sponsored by publishers, the cruises, aboard commercial liners, feature popular authors who give readings and seminars -- even knitting lessons -- to boatfuls of book lovers.\nMs. Jaworski was particularly impressed with a presentation by Ms. Jentz, whose book recounts a brutal attack she survived in Oregon 30 years ago, and subsequent journey back to the scene to investigate. The seas were rough that day, according Ms. Jaworski, so Ms. Jentz delivered her presentation sitting down.\n''I enjoyed it, even though I was feeling a little queasy,'' said Ms. Jaworski.\nFor authors and their publishers, the cruises offer an opportunity to promote their books to a captive audience of hundreds of enthusiastic readers. People tend to read a lot on cruises, and the profile of a typical Ship Lit cruise customer -- older and female -- is an especially good match for romance, health and fitness books, publishers say.\n''It's become increasingly difficult to create and build a book and make it successful,'' says Keith Fox, president of McGraw-Hill Professional, the division of the McGraw-Hill Companies that published Ms. Khalfani's financial advice book. Literary cruises, he said, are ''an opportunity for us to get our authors in front of a demographic that loves books.''\nAuthors say the environment makes for a special experience.\n''You get to connect with people in a way that you never would at a bookshop,'' Ms. Khalfani said. ''I had people stopping me in the bathroom, in the spa. I probably gave another three or four minisessions just sitting around talking shop.''\nThe feeling was mutual. ''Bermuda was stunning, but the authors made the cruise,'' says Julie Rogers, a self-described ''crazed reader'' from San Jose, Calif., who was on the cruise.\nThe company that has done the most to promote Ship Lit, however, is Levy Home Entertainment, a book distributor with thousands of retail accounts, including Wal-Mart Stores, Target, and Kmart.\nWith the support of major publishers, Levy has organized two Authors at Sea cruises that each featured more than two dozen authors. Mary Higgins Clark, Paul Levine, a mystery writer, and Arthur Frommer, a travel expert, have been headliners on the cruises, while Jackie Collins and Dean Koontz have lent their star power to bon voyage parties. The next cruise is tentatively scheduled for 2008.\nLevy has long sought novel ways to spur sales of mass market paperbacks, which the company says account for a third of its sales, such as organizing bus tours and driving groups of authors from city to city to do signings. The idea for a literary cruise grew out of that experience, says Pam Nelson, director of promotions for Levy.\nPublishers say it is difficult to measure the direct impact of the cruises, but they say participating authors see an increase in sales. Harlequin Enterprises sent a half dozen of its writers on the Authors at Sea cruise last spring. Craig Swinwood, executive vice president for sales and marketing at Harlequin, notes that those authors, including Debbie Macomber and Carla Neggers, had record years. Still, ''you could do five cities in that same week,'' on a regular book tour, he said.\nBooks by participating authors are sold onboard. Levy sold about 2,500 books on its last cruise. And the marketing starts months beforehand. In Levy's case, featured books are distributed with an Authors at Sea logo on the covers, and tucked inside each book is a coupon for $250 toward the price of the cruise.\nBut the real payoff may come from the word-of-mouth after vacationers return home, telling their friends and posting their thoughts on one of the many book-oriented Web sites and blogs.\n''These are not just readers; these are power readers that can really drive trends in the book business,'' says John Lindsay, a vice president at Levy.\nIndeed, the Internet has changed the dynamics of the book business in profound ways. Ms. Macomber, who has written dozens of mass market novels, keeps in touch with her fans through her own Web site. ''We're used to being in that celestial cloud,'' she said. ''Now authors are out there. You have to be.''\nAs a featured author on the Levy cruise, Ms. Macomber gave knitting lessons to attendees (knitting features prominently in her 2005 novel, ''A Good Yarn''). After the cruise, she added the readers she had met to her mailing list, and many have left messages on her online guest book, she said.\nKate Duffy, editorial director of the Kensington Publishing Corporation (whose author, Beverly Barton, was on the last Levy cruise), courts these readers, whom she affectionately calls ''the big mouths,'' sending them manuscripts and soliciting their opinions. After attending the Authors at Sea trip, she said, ''I added 10 more big mouths to my list.''\nMEDIA

The Wall Street Journal is now an expert.\nThe paper is introducing its newly designed version -- and smaller size -- tomorrow. It has been touting the design, which it first announced more than a year ago, in a publicity campaign for the last month, building momentum toward the Jan. 2 introduction.\nThe only problem is that Wall Street is shutting down tomorrow to mark the death of former President Gerald R. Ford. Both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market are following tradition, dating from the burial of Ulysses S. Grant in 1885, in honoring the death of a president by halting trading. That means The Journal's core audience is likely to miss the ballyhooed first issue.\nA spokesman for The Journal said that the closing of the markets would not have much affect on the paper's publicity plans, which include giving away half a million copies free at 40,000 newsstands across the country -- most of them not in Manhattan. And most of those copies that are in Manhattan are to be distributed at transportation hubs outside the financial district, like Grand Central Terminal, Penn Station and the Port Authority, to reach ordinary commuters, not the pinstripes downtown.\nBut the crowning feature of the planned hoopla was for Peter R. Kann, chairman of Dow Jones, which owns The Journal, to ring the closing bell at the New York Stock exchange tomorrow. That prized showcase is now canceled.\nKATHARINE Q. SEELYE\nMEDIA TALK
1815763	Costly Gift from Microsoft Is an Invitation to Blog	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EFD91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	In Microsoft's latest attempt to reach out to bloggers, the company recently gave away expensive laptops loaded with its new Windows Vista operating system. But the gifts generated controversy as well as good will, as many in that community accused Microsoft of bribery and their peers of unethical behavior.\nSeveral bloggers reported last week that they had received Acer Ferrari laptops, which can sell for more than $2,200, from Microsoft. A spokeswoman for Microsoft confirmed on Friday that the company had sent out about 90 computers to bloggers who write about technology and other subjects (such as photography and, oddly, parenting) that could be affected by the new operating system.\nBut while those on Microsoft's mailing list initially greeted the machines with enthusiasm, many in the blogging community soon objected -- and not only because they were left off the list -- arguing that bloggers are bound by the same rules as traditional journalists, who should not accept expensive gifts from companies they cover.\nLong Zheng, an Australian blogger (istartedsomething.com) who received one of the computers, had over 160 comments on his post about the computers, ranging from envy to disgust. ''It's a bribe. Plain and simple,'' wrote one commenter.\nOthers disagreed. ''Being provided an evaluation computer from Acer is not a 'bribe,' '' Blake Handler, a Los Angeles blogger (bhandler.spaces.live.com/) who received a laptop and who plans to keep it, wrote in a comment to Mr. Zheng's original post. ''It simply allows me to accelerate my evaluations, documentation and demonstrations of Windows Vista.''\nMicrosoft has recently made several efforts to engage the technologically aware, and often anti-Microsoft, blogging community. After the criticisms of the laptop giveaway began, a Microsoft employee sent an e-mail message to some of the recipients, asking them to return or give away the machines when they were finished evaluating Vista. However, Microsoft's spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement that the followup message had caused confusion, and that the bloggers were still welcome to keep the computers.\n''Microsoft's official position is that once these bloggers are done experiencing the product, they can choose what they want to do with them,'' she said.\nMARIA ASPAN\nMEDIA TALK

1815765	Marsh & McLennan to Sell Putnam Funds to Canadian Group	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEFD91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Marsh & McLennan Companies, the big New York insurance broker, is planning to sell its troubled mutual fund business, Putnam Investments, to the Power Corporation of Canada for about $3.9 billion.\nThe transaction would enable the Power Corporation to establish a foothold in the mutual fund business in the United States. It operates IGM Financial, one of the largest mutual funds in Canada.\nPeople who have been briefed on the transaction said that Marsh & McLennan and Power reached an agreement in principle last week and expect to work out the details early in the new year.\nA spokesman for Marsh & McLennan would not comment on the transaction. Phone calls to the headquarters of Power in Montreal were not answered over the weekend.\nMarsh & McLennan's chief executive, Michael G. Cherkasky, said in September that the company was considering a sale of Putnam, which had been losing business in the aftermath of an industry-wide investigation that began in 2003 into improper trading practices.\nIn late 2004, Marsh & McLennan was accused of rigging bids for customers of its insurance brokerage, its biggest unit, in an investigation by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, that involved all the big insurance brokers. Mr. Spitzer was to be sworn in as governor of New York today.\nMarsh & McLennan paid $850 million to settle a lawsuit by Mr. Spitzer -- more than the other brokers paid -- and its business has declined more than its competitors. Analysts have recommended that Marsh & McLennan sell Putnam as a way to help recover.\nIn November, Marsh said that a long slide in brokerage revenues appeared to have leveled off. It reported growth in its consulting businesses, but a 10 percent decline in revenue at Putnam.\nPutnam has about $190 billion in assets under management, down from nearly $400 billion at the start of 2000.\nFor Power, the purchase, which was reported earlier in The Wall Street Journal, represents an opportunity to expand its success in the Canadian mutual fund industry into the United States. Through a subsidiary, IGM Financial, Power manages about $89 billion in assets. Its funds include some of Canada's best known brands, among them the Investors Group and Mackenzie Financial.\nTo a large extent, those mutual fund operations are intertwined with Power's life insurance operations: Great West Life Assurance, Canada Life Assurance and London Life Insurance.\nA push by Power's financial services group in the United States will also be something of a change in the strategy of the Desmarais family. Since it took control of Power, which was once a electrical utility holding company, the Desmarais family has looked to Europe and Asia as a way to diversify outside of Canada.\nIn Canada, Power is active in the media through its Gesca group, which owns La Presse of Montreal and six other daily newspapers.\nPaul Desmarais, who was born in 1927, dropped out of high school to revive his family's small bus line in Sudbury, Ontario, Mr. Desmarais was so successful that he was soon on an acquisition spree that initially led to his domination of the intercity bus trade in Quebec province and parts of Ontario. A further expansion into insurance and mutual funds led ultimately to his control over Power In 1968.\nMr. Desmarais, his family and Power all have close ties to the Liberal Party of Canada, which has dominated federal politics in Canada. A daughter of Jean Chrétien, the former Canadian prime minister, is married to a member of the Desmarais family. Mr. Chrétien's successor, Paul Martin, once worked for Power and made his fortune through acquiring control of a former Desmarais asset, Canada Steamship Lines.

The children were obviously on their way back to school after completing a field trip.

1815769	Like It or Not, City's Lack of Snow Is a Rarity	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EED91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	No children screeching on toboggans. No thwack against a friend's head. No melting on tongues. No snow. November. December, too.\nFor the last two months, no snow has fallen on Central Park, and it probably won't fall anytime soon, forecasters say. Indeed, not since April 8 has there been even a flurry.\nThe National Weather Service said that last month appeared to be the first December without a snowflake here since 1877, when Rutherford B. Hayes was president.\nMoreover, New York City is not alone. Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, Vienna and Stockholm report little or no snow this season.\nIt has been so warm in Yaroslavl, a city about 150 miles northeast of Moscow, that Masha the bear, a resident of the city zoo, woke up last month from his hibernation after only a week.\nIn Central Park on Saturday, where children were gliding along on roller skates and rumbling around on three-wheelers, Rob Flanagan, 35, a general contractor from Hoboken, N.J., was peeved.\n''Global warming!'' he said. ''Al might be right!'' Mr. Flanagan was referring to Al Gore, the former vice president and crusader against greenhouse gases. The mild weather stinks, he said. ''I like the snow!''\nStuart Welburn, a lawyer who lives on the Upper West Side, disagreed on behalf of his 9-month-old son, Owen, whom he was carrying on his shoulder.\n''This guy is happier without the biting cold,'' Mr. Welburn said, adding that Owen's mother, Melissa, was the same way.\nOn the other hand, Mr. Welburn and his older son, Will, 21/2, love the snow and tobogganing. ''We play in the snow right there, on that mound in particular,'' Mr. Welburn said, motioning toward a small hill just off the West 72nd Street entrance to Central Park. ''This whole area is well populated with sleds in the winter.''\nJason Krantz, 38, another lawyer who lives on the Upper West Side, said he didn't miss the snow. His two toddlers and a nephew were busy clambering up a big boulder, yelling ''123!'' and then jumping down into Mr. Krantz's outstretched arms.\n''I enjoy the snow when it's here,'' Mr. Krantz said as he watched for flying children. ''But I'm just as happy when there's no snow here as well, because you don't have to cover the kids in scarves and gloves and mittens.''\nTodd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, said mild temperatures were likely to persist in the New York metropolitan region for the next week or so. If there is no snow by Friday, he said, it will break a record established on Jan. 4, 1878, for the latest winter appearance of snow.\nMr. Miner said it was not quite clear why snow had failed to appear. ''The northern branch of the jet stream -- the delivery system of arctic air -- has hunkered down near the Arctic Circle,'' he said. It may be because of a complex interaction between ocean temperatures and snow cover in Canada, Mr. Miner said.\nHe cautioned that it would be easy to read too much into the lack of snow so far. The previous four winters, Mr. Miner said, each produced more than 40 inches of snow in New York City, nearly double the annual average of 22.4 inches.\nStill, Julianne Warren, 40, a conservation biologist visiting New York from Lexington, Va., is concerned. She said she heard a white-throated sparrow in Central Park and saw an azalea blooming.\n''Things seem a little --'' she said, and then wiggled her outstretched right hand as if it were an airplane in turbulence. ''It may mean the flowers don't bloom at the right time and birds may not know to migrate at the right time.''

He has pledged to reform the way the state does business and to bring a higher ethical standard to Albany. He recently outlined a number of sweeping steps that he would take unilaterally, including restricting campaign contributions and banning gifts of more than nominal value. But after promising to look far and wide for talent, many of his appointees come from the attorney general's office, or from his campaign staff. Some key positions remain unfilled, including the job of health commissioner. Here are the top officials who have been named, many of whom require Senate confirmation.\nDANNY HAKIM\nTHE GOVERNOR'S CENTRAL STAFF\nRichard Baum SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNOR Mr. Spitzer's right-hand man and longtime chief of staff as attorney general will fill the same role in the governor's office.

1815771	Johnny Gibson, 101, Track Coach With a Long Legacy	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EED91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Johnny Gibson, a former world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles and a highly successful track coach at Seton Hall University for 26 years, died Friday in a nursing home in Newton, N.J. He was 101.\nHis death was announced by his son Thomas.\nGibson's best year as an athlete was 1927. In April, he won the college 400-meter hurdles in the Penn Relays in 55.2 seconds, beating Lord David Burghley of Britain. After the race, some officials and coaches tried to have Gibson disqualified, contending that he was ineligible because he was a night student at Fordham University. Burghley said Gibson won fairly and told the officials he would not accept the first-place medal no matter what they ruled. They dropped the matter.\nThat summer, Gibson received a degree in business administration from Fordham. On July 2, the day Burghley set a world record in London of 54.2 seconds for the 440-yard hurdles, Gibson set a world record of 52.6 seconds in winning the 400-meter hurdles in the national championships in Lincoln, Neb.\nIn an interview with The New York Times in May 2002 in the home Gibson shared with his son John Jr. in rural Franklin, N.J., Gibson recalled his record race.\n''I was in the outside lane,'' he said. ''On the backstretch, I looked back and couldn't see anyone. I thought, 'Oh boy, I got this one today.' But I was surprised I broke the record. My coach never told me I was that fast. He just told me to run.''\nThe coach was the celebrated Harry Coates, who tolerated no nonsense. As Gibson told it: ''Once, after a meet, he bought me a beer. When I finished it, he said, 'Don't ever let me see you drink one of these again.' ''\nGibson was 5 when his father died, and he attended Bloomfield (N.J.) High School and then Fordham at night, working days running messages on Wall Street (he actually ran from building to building). He trained by himself at odd hours, using park benches as hurdles.\nJohn Anthony Gibson was born July 3, 1905, in Greenwich Village and moved to New Jersey when he was 6 months old. He ran his first race at 13 and his last at 32. The demands of work forced him to quit elite racing after the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, where he barely missed qualifying for the final of the 400-meter hurdles.\nAfter coaching Fordham's freshman track team in the mid-1930s, he served as Seton Hall's coach from 1946 until he retired in 1972. His best athletes included Andy Stanfield, a sprinter who won two Olympic gold medals in 1952 and a silver in 1956; Frank Fox; Phil Thigpen; Harry Bright; Bob Carter, who became Gibson's son-in-law; and the twins George and Herb Gehrmann.\nWhen recalling his race against Lord Burghley, who would win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles in the 1928 Olympics, Gibson said he never expected to lose, and Carter smiled.\n''He taught us that,'' Carter said. ''It never occurred to us that we would lose.''\nFrom 1925 to the late 1980s, Gibson attended all but one Penn Relays as a competitor, coach or official. He missed the 1973 event because of a son's wedding. Gibson served there and at other meets as an unpaid clerk.\n''My job was to get the meet on time and keep it there,'' he said. ''I was never late. I'd get them lined up two or three races in advance.''\nAt various times, he trained Army Special Forces coaches in Germany, sold life and auto insurance and Japanese silk, kept track of material for the World War II Manhattan Project, and taught football place-kicking.\nHis wife of 67 years, the former Dorothy Croughan of Bloomfield, died in 1997. He is survived by two sons, John Jr. of Franklin, N.J., and Thomas of West Orange, N.J.; three daughters, D. Patricia Carter of Bloomfield, N.J.; Katharine Lipinski of Surf City, N.J., and Mary Donegan of Ogdensburg, N.J.; a sister, Helen Ryan of Wayne, N.J.; 19 grandchildren and 46 greatgrandchildren and 5 great-greatgrandchildren, the youngest a girl born last Wednesday.\nIn 1973, when The Times asked Gibson how track athletes had changed, he said: ''The big difference is in the attitude toward training. They don't seem to take things quite as seriously as in the past and they don't want to spend the time.''\nIn 2002, responding to the same question, he said: ''It's still the same, but the good ones are in it because they respect the game. If you're a track man, you're a good man.''
1815772	Dennis Linde, 63, Hit Songwriter	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803EED91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Dennis Linde, an influential and publicity-shy country songwriter who composed Elvis Presley's soulful 1972 hit ''Burning Love'' and the Dixie Chicks' mordantly humorous 1999 anthem ''Goodbye Earl,'' died on Dec. 22 in Nashville. He was 63.\nThe cause was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease, family members told The Tennessean newspaper.\n''Burning Love'' reached No. 2 on the Billboard pop listings and was Presley's second-highest-charting single in a decade. Mr. Linde said he wrote the song about his recent marriage to Pam Beckham.\n''I was a newlywed, and 'Burning Love' was a great newlywed title,'' Mr. Linde said in an interview with The New York Times in 2005. ''I had it done in 20 minutes.''\nHis wife survives him, along with their son, Will Linde, and two daughters, Lisa Marsden and Katie Brown.\nMr. Linde cited influences as diverse as Mark Twain and George Gershwin and had a songwriting methodology as quirky as he was. On a wall of his home, he hung a map of his own fictitious town, where the offbeat characters in his songs lived and worked, drank and died. Like Hank Williams but unlike nearly all modern country writers, Mr. Linde composed both the words and music for his songs, without co-writers.\nDennis Linde was born in 1943 at Abilene, Tex. He worked in blues and rock bands in St. Louis and finally moved to Nashville in 1969. The music publisher Bob Beckham, whose firm already represented a young Kris Kristofferson, signed Mr. Linde. Mr. Beckham also eventually became Mr. Linde's father-in-law.\nMr. Linde habitually avoided awards shows, even when he knew he had won. EMI, his current publisher, described him in a statement as ''a publicist's nightmare and a singer's dream.''
1815773	Craig Hugh Smyth, 91, Dies; Renaissance Art Historian	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02EED91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Craig Hugh Smyth, an art historian who drew attention to the importance of conservation and the recovery of purloined art and cultural objects, died on Dec. 22 in Englewood, N.J. He was 91 and lived in Cresskill, N.J.\nThe cause was a heart attack, his daughter, Alexandra, said.\nMr. Smyth led the first academic program in conservation in the United States in 1960 as the director of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.\nLong before he began his academic career, he worked in the recovery of stolen art. After the defeat of Germany in World War II, Mr. Smyth was made director of the Munich Central Collecting Point, set up by the Allies for works that they retrieved. There, he received art and cultural relics confiscated by the Nazis, cared for them and tried to return them to their owners or their countries of origin. He served as a lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve during the war, and the art job was part of his military service. Upon returning from Germany in 1946, he lectured at the Frick Collection and, in 1949, was awarded a Fulbright research fellowship, which took him to Florence, Italy.\nIt was in Florence, a city full of art-loving tourists whose presence could be hard on the works they loved, that his interest in conservation was piqued, said Mariët Westermann, the director of the Institute of Fine Arts. He concentrated on the late-Renaissance drawings of Bronzino, best known as a Mannerist painter. While working on his own research, he took photographs of many other drawings of the 16th century.\n''He put Mannerist art back on the map,'' Ms. Westermann said.\nMr. Smyth received his Ph.D. in art history from Princeton in 1956, six years after he became a professor at the Institute of Fine Arts. He wrote many scholarly articles and books, including, ''Mannerism and Maniera'' and ''Repatriation of Art From the Collecting Point in Munich After World War II.''\nMr. Smyth was an honorary trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and was the director of the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies at Villa I Tatti in Florence. He was also chairman of the advisory committee of the J. Paul Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities.\nMr. Smyth is survived by his wife, Barbara Linforth Smyth of Cresskill; two children, Alexandra, of New York City, and Ned, of Sag Harbor, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.
1815774	The Hope of a Fresh Start	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEED91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	New Year's Day is the simplest holiday in the calendar, a Champagne cork of a day after all the effervescence of the evening before. There is no civic agenda, no liturgical content, only the sense of something ended, something begun. It is a good day to clean the ashes out of the wood stove, to consider the possibilities of next summer's garden, to wonder how many weeks into the new year you will be before you marvel at how quickly 2007 is going. ''This will be the year ,'' you find yourself thinking, but before you can finish the thought you remember what all the previous years have taught you -- that there's just no telling.\nWe are supposed to believe in the fresh start of a new year, and who doesn't love the thought of it? But we are just as likely to feel the pull of the old ways on this holiday, to acknowledge the solid comfort -- like it or not -- of the self we happen to have become over the years. We may not say, like Charles Lamb in 1820, that we would no more alter the shape of our lives ''than the incidents of some well-contrived novel.'' But we know what he means.\nNo one has faced the prospect of New Year's time more honestly than Lamb. He knew that its real theme was what he called ''an intolerable disinclination to dying,'' something he felt especially sharply in the dead of winter, awaiting the peal of bells ringing in the new year. It was an inescapable syllogism for him -- New Year, the passing of time, the certainty of death.\nWhat it forced from him was the very thing it should force from all of us -- a renewal of our pleasure in life itself. ''I am in love,'' he wrote, ''with this green earth; the face of town and country; the unspeakable rural solitudes, and the sweet security of streets.''\nEditorial
1815775	Environmental Harmony	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CEED91630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The long history of Congressional bipartisan cooperation on environmental issues dating back to Richard Nixon has been seriously challenged only twice. The first time was in 1995, when the Gingrich Republicans swept into Washington determined to roll back environmental laws, a threat averted by President Bill Clinton's veto pen and the exertions of a group of moderate Republicans. The second challenge occurred during the Congress that has now thankfully drawn to a close.\nThe Democrats' return to power in both houses has raised hopes that some of the old cooperative spirit can be restored and progress made on vital matters like global warming, oil dependency, national parks and threatened wetlands.\nEnvironmentalists in the House will certainly have more time to work on positive legislation, since they will no longer have to play defense against Richard Pombo, the California Republican who produced a stream of destructive schemes to open up protected public lands for commercial exploitation, rescind a longstanding moratorium on offshore drilling and undermine the Endangered Species Act. Mr. Pombo has been ushered into well-deserved retirement by California voters.\nOn the Senate side, there have been striking changes in leadership. Barbara Boxer, who cares about global warming, replaces James Inhofe, who doesn't, as head of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Jeff Bingaman, who emphasizes conservation as the appropriate response to oil dependency, replaces Pete Domenici, who tends to favor greater production of America's dwindling supplies of oil and natural gas, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\nAlthough he'll need Mr. Domenici's help, Mr. Bingaman will almost certainly make a major push for new energy legislation, based on proposals that already have broad bipartisan support and would offer a menu of loans, direct subsidies and tax breaks to encourage the production of fuel-efficient cars as well as alternatives to gasoline.\nThe main legislative responsibility for shaping a national policy on warming falls to Ms. Boxer, who has promised early consideration of various measures aimed at imposing mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions. Absent any support whatsoever from the White House and the Republican leadership, these measures have languished for years even as the problem has grown steadily worse.\nOur own wish list would include several other measures, all within reach. One would be to amend the Clean Air Act to require meaningful reductions in mercury from power plants, overriding the administration's weak regulations. Another would provide robust financing for the national parks.\nFinally, the new Congress needs to amend the Clean Water Act to clear up the confusion caused by several court decisions involving federal protection of wetlands. It should assert, in unmistakable terms, that the act protects all the waters of the United States, large and small, permanent or seasonal, navigable or isolated.\nEditorial

The glut of all cases from years past is 2.7 million and growing, according to the F.B.I., as investigators receive a weekly torrent of 67,000 new requests -- half of them from the immigration services dealing with the normal flood of mostly healthy newcomers.\nCongress understood the special plight of handicapped immigrants who are granted asylum and made sure they are entitled to monthly disability benefits of $603 each as they go through the citizenship process. But it turns out that more than 6,000 people, including some who are amputees or blind, have already found their benefits cut off, and tens of thousands more face a similar fate, because they exceeded the seven-year deadline Congress originally considered adequate for obtaining citizenship.\nLawyers for the handicapped are suing the government, pointing out that these cases increasingly are victims of the background backlog. Unless a solution is ordered, officials estimate another 46,000 will have their benefits cut off by 2012 as they become delayed in the pipeline.\nHere is a classic problem of overstrained bureaucracy in which culpability is diffuse and the results are all too poignant. Social Security officials say that there is no way around the law's seven-year deadline, while background investigators are overwhelmed by security checks with no relief in sight. One solution is to flag the handicapped immigrants as special cases who don't deserve a loss of benefits in the crush of antiterrorist concerns. The immigration law has a host of problems to be tackled by the new Congress, and handicapped newcomers should be among the first to get some attention.\nEditorial
1815777	Edges and Order	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E7D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The heavy winds that blew through the Northeast a couple of weeks ago mostly missed our place. They took only the dead boughs, which now lie scattered along the edges of the pastures like porous old bones. The farmers up here will have a lot of cleaning to do along the fencelines before they bale hay next June or they will be baling kindling. In the woods across from our house, the wind snapped off the top of a sugar maple. The crown lies jagged, uneven, on the ground, not yet weighed down by gravity or moss. It exaggerates the disorder of nature, which seems so apparent in the absence of snow this time of year.\nNearly every image of nature I have ever come across misses the sense of intricate confusion underfoot in the woods, the thickets of goldenrod collapsing into each other along the roadsides, the rotting tusks of fallen beeches broken against the western hillside. It almost never makes sense to talk about the purpose of nature. But now -- until the snow comes at last -- I could easily believe that the purpose of nature is to create edges, if only because every edge, no matter how small, is a new habitation. As purposes go, that could hardly be more different from my own, which is to reduce the number of edges here, so that the big pasture is bounded by four clean lines only, free of interruptions from sumac or knotweed or shattered maple limbs. Left to itself, nature is all interruption.\nThese are the thoughts that crowd around during the shortest days of the year, when the sky is the color of flint and the sun, when it appears, seems to have lost its candlepower. Even the feeling of dormancy -- a harvest of rest -- is incomplete without snow. But disorder is as much in the mind as order. I drive across the county, brooding on confusion, and come upon a towering single oak, stripped of leaves but still symmetrical, mocking the sawmill that lies across the road. The sight of that one tree is enough to banish sorrow.\nLast night, sorting through photos I took in Kansas a couple of months ago, I found some digital snapshots of an ornate box turtle (Terrapene ornata) making its way across a gravel road. I had stopped the car and moved the turtle, in the direction it was pointed, to the other side of the road. Having written a book in the voice of a tortoise, I was of course all courtesy and did not peer closely. But last night I did look closely at the photos I took. And there is the turtle, gazing at me with a vivid orange eye, its pebbled forelimbs dotted with orange, its domed shell inscribed in an unknown cuneiform, as if to remind me that order is where you find it.\nVERLYN KLINKENBORG\nThe Rural Life

Doing changes to being.\nGinger Nathanson Long Valley, N.J. Dec. 26, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nThis last year has given us apologies from Mel Gibson, Michael Richards, George Allen and Terrell Owens, as well as numerous other celebrities and politicians. The common thread is the disassociation between the ''real'' person that each individual is ''inside'' (or claims to be) and the bad behavior that each has displayed in words and actions.\nSome of these individuals have gone so far as to say he did not know who it was that was speaking or acting in such a despicable manner.\nI am not sure how one can have such inner goodness and purity of heart and behave so badly. All I know is that I am judged by my actions and can know others only by how they behave. That is accountability. That is the foundation of a civil society.\nBob Hoot Middleton, Wis., Dec. 26, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nTurn on the television or the radio and listen to the emotional discourse that passes for rational thinking. One hears the irrational voice that used to be kept private.\nIs this a failure of our education to impart the knowledge and confidence one needs to be mature? Or is it a product of our drifting in an ocean of overcommunication?\nWhatever it is, our need now is to take back our private self and return rational thinking to the public self.\nHendrik E. Sadi Yonkers, Dec. 26, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nYears ago, I read an article in The New York Times about a man who had a mean and miserly nature. He knew this and tried to counteract his nature by acting warmly and generously toward others.\nOn his deathbed, people lauded him as a philanthropist and friend to humanity. Within himself, he still felt mean and miserly, but his deeds proclaimed otherwise.\nThe point of that article, as of Orlando Patterson's column, is that the effect you have on others is the important part of your essence. You are defined by your actions, not by your sometimes more ignoble inner thoughts.\nBarbara Preschel New York, Dec. 26, 2006

But, deeply in love, he hesitated. In the cafe where he went to write a letter breaking off the liaison, the server asked him what he wanted. ''Je prendrai une décision,'' he said, I will have a decision. As the server, philosophically, waited for him to place his proper order, he corrected himself. ''Je prendrai une infusion,'' I will have an herbal tea.\nThe practice of making New Year's resolutions is growing rare in France, perhaps because we spread them out from January to December, a demonstration of a delicate balance between good will and willpower. Descendants of the spiritual exercises of the ancients, resolutions are both educational and therapeutic.\nIn declaring resolutions, if possible before witnesses, we nourish the illusion that changing our lifestyles will change our lives: ''This year, I will read Proust.'' ''This year, I will not invade Iraq.'' ''This year, I will be faithful to my wife.'' ''This year, I will reduce unemployment in France.'' Or, more prosaically, ''I will exercise three times a week, I will finally try to stop smoking, I will cut back on sugar,'' etc. It's a sort of collective drunkenness for people to make vows that nobody expects to keep.\nWesterners are athletes of introspection -- we never stop analyzing ourselves. ''It is never too late or too early to care for the well-being of the soul,'' Epicurus said, and so we make our lives a study of ourselves. We need a moment in the year when we look at ourselves, weigh our good and bad habits, evaluate our conduct as a doctor evaluates our health during an annual examination, so we can strive for a way of life that is wiser and more responsible.\nThere are two types of resolutions: those that are reasonable, and those that are not. The day I took communion, when I was an adolescent and still believed in God, I would decide to be good to everyone, to smile at my family, to spread charity and goodwill. This love for my neighbors, even the ones who annoyed me, lasted two days, and then I returned to being an ordinary human, neither good nor bad, with my moods and my preferences. I could not make myself someone I was not.\nSimilarly, to declare that in 2007 we resolve to be happy is unreasonable. We can't determine to be happy: it is in our power to avoid certain evils, to stay away from conflict, to not bankrupt ourselves, to not throw ourselves out the window or under a train, but we can't order up happiness as we order a dish in a restaurant or command a dog to come at our call. Happiness eludes the rendezvous we fix, arrives when we least expect it, disappears when we think we have it in hand.\nIn other words, those people who are unhappy about not being happy forget that happiness has a knack for indirection, coming in the middle of the most ordinary day or disappearing at the height of one's career. It is a matter of luck, almost of grace, a visitor who enters the house unexpectedly and vanishes on tiptoe. ''I recognize happiness by the sound it makes when it leaves,'' said the poet Jacques Prévert.\nIn contrast, let's imagine someone who sets out on Dec. 31 to ruin his life. It's not certain that ruin will arrive easily: it is no less difficult to destroy one's life than to improve it. Catastrophe is a delicate art that also requires chance. Hell is just as hard to get into as heaven.\nIf the end of the year brings a flood of resolutions to change, it is because we are faced with an existence that is invaded by the routine, by the rush of demands. We can't bear it. We know that another life exists, more beautiful, more passionate, one that laziness and apathy keeps us from attaining.\nI have to break with time to overcome my obstacles, to rediscover myself, to be myself in all innocence. I can change my life, at least in some small way. Making resolutions demonstrates optimism, the desire to make oneself better, a faith, naïve and beautiful at once, that declarations can spontaneously become actions, that saying means doing.\nOh, the glorious day of making a resolution, the belief that starting tomorrow I will be the pilot of my existence, that I will stop being the plaything of external circumstances, that I will govern myself. I'm better than I seem to be -- a person obsessed by little irritants, addicted to talking nonsense -- and I'm going to prove it to the world. The certainty that soon, thanks to my willpower, I will no longer be someone who is habitually late, a slave to my cellphone, a glutton, a distracted driver that can galvanize me, prompt me to change, tear away my imperfect personality. Real life starts now; I can immediately free myself of my neuroses, correct myself. I can rid myself of the fear of failure and of the specter of the failures of the past.\nKnowing that you can change your behavior, even by an iota, is essential for holding yourself in esteem. We're often cynical about how resolutions are never kept, but we shouldn't be. Resolutions are perhaps lies, but they're lies of good faith, necessary illusions. As long as we can make them, we are saved, we can control the chaos of destiny; it doesn't matter that we break them and that others view us with skepticism. Every resolution is good simply because it is declared. It is a comedy, perhaps, but it keeps us sane.\nOp-Ed Contributor Pascal Bruckner is the author of ''The Temptation of Innocence: Living in the Age of Entitlement.''

1815782	The Not Wanted Signs	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E7D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	I've heard the concern expressed dozens of times by New Orleans residents who are poor and black and still living in enforced exile from their wounded city: Maybe they don't want us back.\nYou hear it again and again and again, the tone of voice varying from sadness to anger to resignation, but always laced with the unmistakable pain of feeling unwelcome in one's own home. I've come to think of it as the New Orleans lament.\n''They are not trying to bring us home,'' said Geraldine Craig, who is living in a federally sponsored trailer encampment in Baton Rouge. ''Just the opposite. They're telling us to find housing here.''\n''It hurts,'' said Mimi Adams, a woman who wore out her welcome with relatives in Houston and Atlanta but has no idea when she might return to New Orleans. ''Even if I could find a place, the rents are too high,'' she said. ''They've gone up a lot. I'm told they don't want us poor folks back, that they're making it a city for the well-to-do. That's what I'm hearing.''\nSixteen months have passed since the apocalyptic flood that followed Hurricane Katrina. More than 13,000 residents who were displaced by the storm are still living in trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Another 100,000 to 200,000 evacuees -- most of whom want to return home -- are scattered throughout the United States.\nThe undeniable neglect of this population fuels the suspicion among the poor and the black, who constitute a majority of the evacuees, that the city is being handed over to the well-to-do and the white.\nIf you talk to public officials, you will hear about billions of dollars in aid being funneled through this program or that. The maze of bureaucratic initiatives is dizzying. But when you talk to the people most in need of help -- the poor, the elderly, the disabled, the children -- you will find in most cases that the help is not reaching them. There is no massive effort, no master plan, to bring back the people who were driven from the city and left destitute by Katrina.\nOnly the federal government could finance such an effort. Neither the city of New Orleans nor the state of Louisiana has anywhere near the kind of money that would be required. ''You've got a lot of people who don't have a place to stay,'' Gov. Kathleen Blanco told me in an interview on Friday, ''and they're spread all over creation.''\nThe federal government has not come close to meeting the challenge of this overwhelming humanitarian crisis. Instead of a concerted, creative effort to develop housing and organize the return to New Orleans of the poor and working-class families who were the heart and soul of the city, the government focused to a large extent on rolling out travel trailers to temporarily house an embarrassingly small percentage of the people in need.\n''FEMA spent a lot on trailers,'' said Governor Blanco, ''trailers that are falling apart right now. And they spent as much money on those trailers in many cases as you would on putting a new house in place.''\nThe simple fact is that no one at any level of government, city, state or federal, has shown the leadership that was needed in response to this astounding tragedy. I tried to talk about this last week with the mayor of New Orleans, C. Ray Nagin, but he and his chief press aide were on vacation.\nThe most candid official I spoke with was Raymond Jetson, the chief executive of the Louisiana Family Recovery Corps, an independent, nonprofit group set up by the state in the wake of the storm.\n''The most daunting aspect of the recovery is the human recovery,'' he said, ''and at this point it has certainly not received the resources or the attention that it needs.''\nWhat was readily apparent in the aftermath of the botched rescue was the damage to the levees, the ruined homes and the city's devastated infrastructure. ''I don't think,'' said Mr. Jetson, ''that the reality of what was happening in the lives of people and families was as apparent.''\nThe situation remains desperate for thousands of displaced residents. ''Working families are finding it difficult to re-establish their households,'' Mr. Jetson said. ''People who are out of state want to come back home. The clock is ticking on the people who are living in the FEMA trailer communities. You have some people who are totally isolated from resources. And the emotional well-being of a significant number of people and families is literally in peril.''\nThis is how the new year is starting out for the victims of the great flood of 2005.\nOp-Ed Columnist
1815783	A Healthy New Year	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE7D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The U.S. health care system is a scandal and a disgrace. But maybe, just maybe, 2007 will be the year we start the move toward universal coverage.\nIn 2005, almost 47 million Americans -- including more than 8 million children -- were uninsured, and many more had inadequate insurance.\nApologists for our system try to minimize the significance of these numbers. Many of the uninsured, asserted the 2004 Economic Report of the President, ''remain uninsured as a matter of choice.''\nAnd then you wake up. A scathing article in yesterday's Los Angeles Times described how insurers refuse to cover anyone with even the slightest hint of a pre-existing condition. People have been denied insurance for reasons that range from childhood asthma to a ''past bout of jock itch.''\nSome say that we can't afford universal health care, even though every year lack of insurance plunges millions of Americans into severe financial distress and sends thousands to an early grave. But every other advanced country somehow manages to provide all its citizens with essential care. The only reason universal coverage seems hard to achieve here is the spectacular inefficiency of the U.S. health care system.\nAmericans spend more on health care per person than anyone else -- almost twice as much as the French, whose medical care is among the best in the world. Yet we have the highest infant mortality and close to the lowest life expectancy of any wealthy nation. How do we do it?\nPart of the answer is that our fragmented system has much higher administrative costs than the straightforward government insurance systems prevalent in the rest of the advanced world. As Anna Bernasek pointed out in yesterday's New York Times, besides the overhead of private insurance companies, ''there's an enormous amount of paperwork required of American doctors and hospitals that simply doesn't exist in countries like Canada or Britain.''\nIn addition, insurers often refuse to pay for preventive care, even though such care saves a lot of money in the long run, because those long-run savings won't necessarily redound to their benefit. And the fragmentation of the American system explains why we lag far behind other nations in the use of electronic medical records, which both reduce costs and save lives by preventing many medical errors.\nThe truth is that we can afford to cover the uninsured. What we can't afford is to keep going without a universal health care system.\nIf it were up to me, we'd have a Medicare-like system for everyone, paid for by a dedicated tax that for most people would be less than they or their employers currently pay in insurance premiums. This would, at a stroke, cover the uninsured, greatly reduce administrative costs and make it much easier to work on preventive care.\nSuch a system would leave people with the right to choose their own doctors, and with other choices as well: Medicare currently lets people apply their benefits to H.M.O.'s run by private insurance companies, and there's no reason why similar options shouldn't be available in a system of Medicare for all. But everyone would be in the system, one way or another.\nCan we get there from here? Health care reform is in the air. Democrats in Congress are talking about providing health insurance to all children. John Edwards began his presidential campaign with a call for universal health care.\nAnd there's real action at the state level. Inspired by the Massachusetts plan to cover all its uninsured residents, politicians in other states are talking about adopting similar plans. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon has introduced a Massachusetts-type plan for the nation as a whole.\nBut now is the time to warn against plans that try to cover the uninsured without taking on the fundamental sources of our health system's inefficiency. What's wrong with both the Massachusetts plan and Senator Wyden's plan is that they don't operate like Medicare; instead, they funnel the money through private insurance companies.\nEveryone knows why: would-be reformers are trying to avoid too strong a backlash from the insurance industry and other players who profit from our current system's irrationality.\nBut look at what happened to Bill Clinton. He rejected a single-payer approach, even though he understood its merits, in favor of a complex plan that was supposed to co-opt private insurance companies by giving them a largely gratuitous role. And the reward for this ''pragmatism'' was that insurance companies went all-out against his plan anyway, with the notorious ''Harry and Louise'' ads that, yes, mocked the plan's complexity.\nNow we have another chance for fundamental health care reform. Let's not blow that chance with a pre-emptive surrender to the special interests.\nOp-Ed Columnist
1815784	Folly's Antidote	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	MANY signs point to a growing historical consciousness among the American people. I trust that this is so. It is useful to remember that history is to the nation as memory is to the individual. As persons deprived of memory become disoriented and lost, not knowing where they have been and where they are going, so a nation denied a conception of the past will be disabled in dealing with its present and its future. ''The longer you look back,'' said Winston Churchill, ''the farther you can look forward.''\nBut all historians are prisoners of their own experience. We bring to history the preconceptions of our personalities and of our age. We cannot seize on ultimate and absolute truths. So the historian is committed to a doomed enterprise -- the quest for an unattainable objectivity.\nConceptions of the past are far from stable. They are perennially revised by the urgencies of the present. When new urgencies arise in our own times and lives, the historian's spotlight shifts, probing at last into the darkness, throwing into sharp relief things that were always there but that earlier historians had carelessly excised from the collective memory. New voices ring out of the historical dark and demand to be heard.\nOne has only to note how in the last half-century the movements for women's rights and civil rights have reformulated and renewed American history. Thus the present incessantly reinvents the past. In this sense, all history, as Benedetto Croce said, is contemporary history. It is these permutations of consciousness that make history so endlessly fascinating an intellectual adventure. ''The one duty we owe to history,'' said Oscar Wilde, ''is to rewrite it.''\nWe are the world's dominant military power, and I believe a consciousness of history is a moral necessity for a nation possessed of overweening power. History verifies John F. Kennedy's proposition, stated in the first year of his thousand days: ''We must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient -- that we are only 6 percent of the world's population; that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind; that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity; and therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.''\nHistory is the best antidote to delusions of omnipotence and omniscience. Self-knowledge is the indispensable prelude to self-control, for the nation as well as for the individual, and history should forever remind us of the limits of our passing perspectives. It should strengthen us to resist the pressure to convert momentary impulses into moral absolutes. It should lead us to acknowledge our profound and chastening frailty as human beings -- to a recognition of the fact, so often and so sadly displayed, that the future outwits all our certitudes and that the possibilities of the future are more various than the human intellect is designed to conceive.\nSometimes, when I am particularly depressed, I ascribe our behavior to stupidity -- the stupidity of our leadership, the stupidity of our culture. Three decades ago, we suffered defeat in an unwinnable war against tribalism, the most fanatic of political emotions, fighting against a country about which we knew nothing and in which we had no vital interests. Vietnam was hopeless enough, but to repeat the same arrogant folly 30 years later in Iraq is unforgivable. The Swedish statesman Axel Oxenstierna famously said, ''Behold, my son, with how little wisdom the world is governed.''\nA nation informed by a vivid understanding of the ironies of history is, I believe, best equipped to manage the tragic temptations of military power. Let us not bully our way through life, but let a growing sensitivity to history temper and civilize our use of power. In the meantime, let a thousand historical flowers bloom. History is never a closed book or a final verdict. It is forever in the making. Let historians never forsake the quest for knowledge in the interests of an ideology, a religion, a race, a nation.\nThe great strength of history in a free society is its capacity for self-correction. This is the endless excitement of historical writing -- the search to reconstruct what went before, a quest illuminated by those ever-changing prisms that continually place old questions in a new light.\nHistory is a doomed enterprise that we happily pursue because of the thrill of the hunt, because exploring the past is such fun, because of the intellectual challenges involved, because a nation needs to know its own history. Or so we historians insist. Because in the end, a nation's history must be both the guide and the domain not so much of its historians as its citizens.\nOp-Ed Contributor Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who has won Pulitzer Prizes for history and biography, is the author, most recently, of ''War and the American Presidency.''
1815785	Hamas Reports Progress On Freeing Israeli Soldier	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E6D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Palestinian groups involved in holding an Israeli soldier who was captured in late June said Sunday that significant progress had been made toward a prisoner exchange that would release him.\nA spokesman in Gaza for the military wing of Hamas said Sunday that ''there is a breakthrough'' in the prisoner issue ''and we hope it will be concluded very soon.'' The spokesman, Abu Ubaida, suggested that a deal could be close for the release of Cpl. Gilad Shalit, captured by Hamas and two other militant groups in a raid into Israel on June 25.\nA spokesman for the larger Hamas movement in Gaza, Fawzi Barhum, confirmed Sunday that ''there has been progress,'' while the Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, of Hamas, said last Thursday that the Israeli soldier would be freed soon.\nEgypt has spent months trying to broker a deal. But its efforts have been stymied repeatedly by the refusal of Hamas leaders in exile -- in particular Khaled Meshal, who heads the Hamas political bureau -- to sanction an agreement that would send Corporal Shalit home before hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are released.\nThe government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel played down the prospect of quick results. A spokeswoman for Mr. Olmert, Miri Eisin, said a release was not imminent and there remained ''problems,'' a view echoed by the Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat.\nMr. Olmert is to meet Thursday with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, and there has been news media speculation that a deal could be announced there.\nThe Egyptian foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said a prisoner exchange would be discussed at the meeting. ''The deal is ready,'' he told the London daily newspaper Al Hayat. But the deal ''awaits a Palestinian side capable of taking its own decisions.''\n''Once the decision is Palestinian, without foreign pressure, then the exchange will take place,'' Mr. Aboul Gheit said, an apparent and apparently bitter reference to the influence that Syria and Iran have over Mr. Meshal and the military wing of Hamas. Mr. Meshal lives in exile in Damascus, Syria, where the government has rebuffed all Western requests to close his office.\n''The deal will be done once both sides agree on the overall deal Egypt has proposed and is trying to put into effect,'' Mr. Aboul Gheit said.\nThe Egyptians have been working on a deal under which Corporal Shalit would be delivered into their hands. The Israelis, who will not deal directly with Hamas, would then begin to release some Palestinian prisoners, beginning with women and youngsters, with more to follow once the corporal is back in Israel.\nThe total of Palestinian prisoners to be released has been described variously at 450 to 1,000, including some who have served long sentences in Israeli prisons for serious offenses. The Israelis are always reluctant to release prisoners convicted of involvement in killing Israelis.\nMr. Olmert is also trying to ensure that the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, gets credit for the swap, not the militants of Hamas and the Popular Resistance Committees who captured Corporal Shalit.\nThe Palestinian groups put the onus on Israel. ''The swap depends on whether there is an Israeli intention to make it happen,'' said a spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees, who calls himself Abu Mujahed. He said Corporal Shalit was in good health.\nThe capture of the corporal resulted in a return of Israeli soldiers to the Gaza Strip, which they had left in 2005. A bloody summer and autumn followed, with a series of Israeli incursions, continuing Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel from Gaza and fierce internal Palestinian fighting as Hamas and Fatah struggled for power.\nMr. Olmert had made the release of Corporal Shalit a condition for a serious meeting with Mr. Abbas, but changed his mind as the situation deteriorated and Washington pressed for some political movement with Fatah.\nAs of November, Israel was holding 9,075 Palestinian prisoners, including 345 minors, according to the independent Israeli human rights group B'Tselem.\nOn Friday, the Israeli soldier's father, Noam Shalit, published a letter in the Palestinian daily Al Quds, addressing his son and appealing to his captors.\nHe wrote: ''The fact that we don't know how you are, how you feel, how you are making it through the winter, and how the Palestinian organizations holding you are treating you, is very hard for us. They declare that you are a prisoner of war, but unfortunately, they are preventing you from receiving the rights to which you are entitled as a prisoner of war according to international law, and also according to the exalted Islamic law.''\nMr. Shalit then quoted verses from the Koran on the treatment of prisoners and said he hoped that during the Muslim feast of Id al-Adha, which began over the weekend, ''a change would take place in the position of the Palestinian organizations holding you,'' to enable the Palestinian families of prisoners held in Israel to soon see their relatives.\nHe asked the captors to show his son the letter, which ends: ''Don't break before you are released, which is very close, and we are doing all we can so that your release and the release of the Palestinian prisoners will be very close.''
1815787	Tehran Radio Lets Critics Vent Over Iran's Nuclear Plans	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	A radio program on a government-run station has been conducting an open debate for the past month about whether Iran should change its tough stance on its nuclear program.\nThe radio program, Goftegoo Radio, which went on the air last May, has used a debate format to broadcast discussions about any number of formerly taboo issues, but its recent fiery discussions about whether the country should have a nuclear program may be setting new boundaries for talk about one of the most important issues in Iran today.\nThe United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on Dec. 23 to impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, including barring trade in goods or technology used in the program. The measure is aimed at curbing Iran's program for uranium enrichment, which can also be used for making a nuclear bomb. The Security Council has given Iran a two-month deadline to suspend its program or face tougher sanctions.\nIran has refused to comply with the demand and has said it has the right to enrich uranium under the international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It contends that its program is for peaceful energy purposes, but the United States and European nations contend that Tehran is trying to develop a nuclear arms program.\nCritics inside the country have long been barred from discussing the subject. Reformist newspapers cautiously warned last week that the sanctions could have dangerous consequences for the country. But they refrained from concluding whether enrichment should be suspended to prevent those consequences, apparently fearing that the mere suggestion could lead to a government move to close them down.\nBut guests on Goftegoo -- which means dialogue in Persian -- have expressed their criticisms fearlessly, with some calling on the government to put the country's other interests before its nuclear program.\nThe state-owned broadcasting monopoly, which has great power and an enormous budget, is among the few state-run agencies that is not controlled by the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has refused to back down on the nuclear program in the face of world pressure.\nThe broadcasting agency reports directly to Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final word on all state matters. The new director, Ezzatollah Zarghami, took over the agency in mid-2005, as Mr. Ahmadinejad took office. Mr. Zarghami is a former general of the conservative Revolutionary Guards who is believed to be close to Ayatollah Khamenei.\nAnalysts say Mr. Zarghami, who is not close to the president, may be using his closeness to Ayatollah Khamenei to build his own power base. But the motivation behind the political discussions on the program is not completely clear.\n''Why have the officials linked the country's development to the nuclear program?'' Sadeq Zibakalam, a professor of political science at Tehran University who has appeared on the show a number of times, asked on a show three weeks ago. ''Why have they tried to convince people with the wrong notion that if we suspend our program we lose our national identity and our independence?''\nHe said Iran was a developing country whose hospitals and schools still needed major investment. He said spending huge amounts of money for the country's nuclear program -- without mentioning the costs of sanctions or a military confrontation -- would not contribute to the country's development.\nMr. Zibakalam said in an interview that he agreed to appear as a guest on the show only if he could express his opinion freely. His condition was immediately accepted, he said.\nThe host of the show, Amir Dabirimehr, a 29-year old doctoral candidate in political science, said the purpose of the program was to allow critics to express their opinions.\n''The show wants to provide an opportunity for all ideas to be expressed on the state-run media so that they don't turn to other outlets,'' he said. ''We tell our speakers that they are our guests and we will be responsible for whatever they say.''\nMany of the people he has invited to appear have been skeptical of his guarantees, though, and have turned down the invitation.\n''I welcome the show but it could be dangerous if the state-run media wants to carry the mantle for free speech,'' said Mahmoud Shamsolvaezin, a veteran journalist and media analyst in Tehran. ''If the government really wants to broadcast the voices of its critics, it should let them have their own publications.''\nOver a hundred reformist newspapers that criticized the government have been shut down by the authorities, and dozens of journalists have been jailed in recent years.\nMany people watch satellite programs beamed from the United States by opposition groups in exile. Satellite television is banned in Iran, but many people ignore the law.\nRadio and television channels operated in Iran are controlled by the government agency, whose director is appointed by Ayatollah Khamenei. Goftegoo Radio, a daily show, devotes one or two programs a week to political subjects. It usually has at least two guests, one advocate and one opponent of the subject of the day's debate.\nOn a program last week, Mr. Zibakalam challenged Yadollah Javani, a senior member of the Revolutionary Guards and an ardent advocate of Iran's nuclear program.\nMr. Javani brushed off the sanctions as insignificant and repeated the government line that the United States was manipulating the Security Council against Iran.\nMr. Zibakalam, in response, said, ''I don't know if you really believe in what you say or you just say that to people.''\nHe noted that Iran's government had sponsored a conference of Holocaust doubters in Tehran in December and said that it was natural to expect Germany to vote against Iran at the Security Council meeting with that kind of provocation. ''Every time we have to deal with the consequences of our actions, we bring up ideological arguments,'' he said.\n''I believe these sanctions are only the tip of the iceberg, and they can have very severe consequences if we don't deal with them within the next two months,'' he warned.
1815788	Nonrenewal of TV License Stokes Debate in Venezuela	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE6D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	President Hugo Chávez's decision not to renew the broadcast license of RCTV, one of this country's oldest television stations and a frequent critic of his government, has fueled a fierce debate over whether he is stifling dissent in Venezuela as he strengthens his control of the broadcasting industry.\nSenior officials in Mr. Chávez's government moved quickly to react to growing international and domestic criticism of the decision. Reporters Without Borders, the Paris-based press freedom group, said the move, which Mr. Chávez announced in a speech before military officers last week, was a ''serious attack on editorial pluralism.'' The group asked Mr. Chávez's government ''to reconsider its stance and guarantee an independent system of concessions and renewals of licenses.''\nVice President José Vicente Rangel said the decision was not political retaliation but a ''right of the state for reasons that are justified.'' Others officials, however, made it clear that the decision was a reaction to RCTV's editorial policies, particularly in relation to a coup in April 2002 that briefly removed Mr. Chávez as president.\n''RCTV's determining role during the events of the 2002 coup must be remembered,'' Willian Lara, the communications minister, said at a news conference on Friday. ''That irresponsible attitude hasn't changed at RCTV.''\nThe actions of RCTV and other private broadcasters during the chaotic days of the coup are at the heart of their tension with Mr. Chávez's government. Several of the broadcasters appeared to support the coup, substituting coverage of the coup's collapse and Mr. Chávez's return to power with reruns of American movies and Walt Disney cartoons.\nSince then, Mr. Chávez has accused the broadcasters of waging a ''psychological war'' against his administration, describing the country's main channels, Globovisión, Televen, Venevisión and RCTV, as ''horsemen of the apocalypse.'' His re-election this month to a six-year term has not tempered his disdain for the traditional news media elite and for RCTV in particular.\n''This decision can only be seen as a control strategy and an abuse of power,'' said Ewald Scharfenberg, executive director of the Institute for Press and Society, a group here that examines press freedom issues.\nThrough elections and personnel changes over the past eight years, Mr. Chávez and his supporters have consolidated power across Venezuela's political institutions, controlling Congress, the Supreme Court and every state government but two. The privately controlled media are one of the areas of society, along with private enterprise, religious institutions and professional sports, outside of Mr. Chávez's control.\nTeodoro Petkoff, editor of the opposition-aligned newspaper Tal Cual, described Venezuela's political system as an ''autocracy'' advancing toward ''light totalitarianism,'' in comments this month that inflamed Mr. Chávez's government.\nWith their vociferous criticism of Mr. Chávez and his policies, private newspapers, television stations and radio broadcasters, along with a small community of Internet bloggers, offer daily evidence that freedom of expression still exists here.\nStill, pro-Chávez legislation has enhanced the government's ability to clamp down on critics through legal action or threats of prosecution, creating a ''climate of self-censorship,'' according to Human Rights Watch. A 2004 law subjects television and radio stations to heavy fines or suspension of their licenses for broadcasts deemed to ''condone or incite'' public disturbances.\nSimilarly, legislators amended the criminal code last year to increase penalties for criminal defamation and libel. Napoleón Bravo, a well-known television journalist, was charged under those new provisions this year for denigrating the Supreme Court by claiming that it was inefficient and suggesting that it be replaced with a brothel.\nSince the coup in 2002, two private stations, RCTV and Globovisión, have remained critical of Mr. Chávez while two others, Venevisión and Televen, have become decidedly less so. RCTV's contentious relationship with Mr. Chávez worsened during the coup, when Andrés Izarra, the news operations manager for RCTV, resigned after he said his superiors suppressed coverage of developments about the coup.\nMr. Izarra went on to become Mr. Chávez's communications minister and is now head of Telesur, a pan-Latin American news station that is one of numerous media ventures supported by Venezuela's government in recent years. Federal and regional governments now control five television stations, including one used to broadcast all of Mr. Chávez's domestic speeches and an influential talk show that pillories his critics.\nThe government also controls eight radio broadcasters and a news agency, and is building a communications satellite with assistance from China that is scheduled to be launched into orbit by 2008. Mr. Lara, the communications minister, said one option for RCTV once its license expires in 2007 would be for Venezuela de Televisión, the government's main broadcaster, to take control of its operations.\nSome of Mr. Chávez's dislike for RCTV appears to stem in part from how Marcel Granier, the broadcaster's chief executive, has publicly referred to him as a ''lieutenant colonel.'' The term refers to the rank Mr. Chávez achieved in Venezuela's army, but is also an attempt to mock him as militaristic.\nIn his speech announcing his decision to not renew RCTV's license, Mr. Chávez, dressed in a military uniform and red beret, appeared to jab at the reference. ''When they try to say that someone is a gorilla, an ignoramus,'' Mr. Chávez said, ''they say he is a lieutenant colonel.''\nThe tension created by the RCTV decision left some wondering how Mr. Chávez will treat other critics as he starts a new term. ''It leaves a very bad taste that we end the year with this anxiety,'' Archbishop Roberto Luckert of Coro said in comments on private radio. ''This is a trampling of freedom of expression.''
1815789	With Renovations Set for Official Residence, U.N. Chief Can't Unpack Yet	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E5D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	When Ban Ki-moon takes over as secretary general of the United Nations on Monday, he may quickly have to grapple with the crisis in Darfur, fighting in Somalia and the continuing strife in the Middle East. But he will have to wait to enjoy one of the more glamorous trappings of his new post: the secretary general's official residence on Sutton Place, the exclusive Manhattan enclave off the East River.\nThe General Assembly recently approved a $4.5 million renovation of the residence, a 14,000-square-foot neo-Georgian attached town house with four floors and a basement. Until October, when the work is expected to be completed, Mr. Ban and his wife will sleep and entertain in a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria, where they have been living since November.\nChoi Soung-ah, who has been serving as a spokeswoman during Mr. Ban's transition, said that while he would have preferred to move directly into the Sutton Place residence, ''it's just essential refurbishment that's been pushed off for years.''\n''He would rather, of course, be in the official residence and not living in a hotel where he can't really unpack his own things, his own belongings,'' Ms. Choi said. ''There is such a thing as the official residence of the secretary general. Of course that would be better, and it would be very convenient.''\nThe residence was once home to Anne Morgan, the daughter of J. P. Morgan, the financier. It was donated to the United Nations in 1972 and has not been significantly refurbished since 1950, according to a September report prepared by the secretary general's office.\nThe report estimated that the renovation effort would cost $4.49 million. Of that, $650,900 would go toward security upgrades, including $137,700 for a digital video-recording system and additional cameras.\nThe price includes $200,000 to upgrade the kitchen, $100,000 to redo the restrooms and $2.1 million for a central heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system. The upgrades that are not related to security total $255 per square foot.\nThe General Assembly also approved $202,500 for temporary accommodations for the incoming secretary general and his family. Details in the report hint at the sort of domestic annoyances the departing secretary general, Kofi Annan, has dealt with since he took up the post in 1997. The house currently ''poses safety hazards'' and is prone to ''severe malfunctions, requiring increasingly frequent emergency repairs,'' the report says. Specifically, it describes a ''technologically obsolete'' telecommunications system, an 85-year-old electrical wiring system unequipped to handle the phalanx of communications and security technology required by a modern world leader and an elevator that violates New York City's safety code.\nThe building is heated with steam, which frequently leaks from ''heavily corroded'' pipes and fittings, the secretary general's report says, damaging walls and furniture. The high-powered fans that are used to address the leaks sometimes make matters worse, by overloading the electrical circuit and causing power failures.\nThe General Assembly has also approved a separate, extensive renovation of the United Nations headquarters, which is expected to cost $1.9 billion and take seven years.\nIn the meantime, Mr. Ban, the former South Korean foreign minister, will not have to wait to move into his new office, on the 38th floor of the gleaming Secretariat building. He will do so starting Monday, but not a moment sooner, Ms. Choi said, noting, ''Kofi Annan is still the secretary general until the 31st of December.''
1815790	The Neediest Cases; After a Fire, Putting an Immigrant Family's Dreams Back on Track	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E5D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	A year ago, as the Mendez-Rojas family slept on New Year's Day after a night of celebrating, a fire was spreading in the walls of their studio apartment on Gerard Avenue in the South Bronx.\nAt 10 a.m., a neighbor who had gone to throw out the garbage saw smoke. She woke up the Mendez-Rojas family, who gathered their documents -- precious possessions for immigrants -- and left the building.\nWhen they returned later in the day, they found wires hanging out of human-size holes in the walls, clouds peeking through the ceiling and most of their belongings scattered under ash and water.\nAlmost a year later, as Rosanna Rojas, 40, and her daughter, Roxana Mendez, 14, gave a tour of their new apartment in the Mitchell Houses in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx, they pointed out the few possessions that survived the fire. There is Ms. Rojas's industrial-size sewing machine, a boombox, and the framed picture of a Frank Lloyd Wright building that Ms. Rojas drew years ago while studying to be an architect in the Dominican Republic, the family's home country. Johnny Mendez, 42, her husband, showed two of his water-damaged law books.\nThey also like to point out where each item in the house came from. A family they met in the Ruth Fernandez Family Center, the shelter where they lived for seven months after the fire, gave them a bedroom set. Ms. Rojas split the pieces among the family: she and Mr. Mendez took the bed, Roxana got the bureau, and Jonathan, 17, got the nightstands. A friend gave the family bunk beds, which Ms. Rojas separated for her children.\n''If it's good, it doesn't have anything to do with the fire, I'll take it,'' Ms. Rojas said.\nMs. Rojas moved to New York in 1990 in hopes of earning money for the family, leaving her husband and son behind. She traveled back and forth while Mr. Mendez practiced law in the Dominican Republic. She gave birth to Roxana there two years later and brought the baby with her to the United States, where she worked in various textile factories through the years and got her immigration status in order. The rest of the family joined them in 2000, although Mr. Mendez -- who is a legal resident of the United States, though not a citizen like the others in his family -- continued to split his time between New York and the Dominican Republic until October 2005, when he decided to stay in New York permanently.\n''We were in a studio, but we were stable,'' Ms. Rojas said, speaking about the apartment that was destroyed by the fire.\nThe couple decided that Ms. Rojas would continue working while Mr. Mendez studied for a law degree that would let him practice in the United States. Now, she works four days a week sewing curtains for C. J. Dellatore Textile, while Mr. Mendez takes English classes five nights a week at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens, in preparation for a standardized English exam.\nHe greets the children when they get home from school and cooks hearty Dominican meals for the family. He makes a mean pork chop.\nExplaining the couple's decision to sacrifice some comforts by having Mr. Mendez study rather than work, Ms. Rojas said, ''I'm a little strained, but if we spend the rest of our lives in a factory, then it's not a good future.''\nThe children attend the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, a public high school in East Harlem. When their belongings were destroyed in the fire, they were the most worried about their books. But they never missed a day of school. A guidance counselor who learned that they had lost everything referred them to the Children's Aid Society, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.\nYalenis Cruz, the aid society's coordinator at the school, immediately dipped into the fund and gave the family $500 for clothes, toiletries and other basic household items. Ms. Rojas recently bought a couch and will be reimbursed with money from the fund.\nDespite having lost everything, the Mendez-Rojas family is optimistic, and concerned more with the future than with the past.\nAfter living in the shelter, Roxana decided that she wanted to be a doctor rather than a fashion designer, so she could help people. Jonathan is waiting to hear back from the colleges he applied to. He expects to enroll in City College in the fall and wants to be a computer systems engineer. Mr. Mendez expects to be practicing criminal law in New York by 2010.\nAnd Ms. Rojas is waiting for all of these dreams to become reality so that she can complete her final year of school and receive her degree in architecture.\nPreviously recorded: $3,693,101.49 Recorded Thursday:110,794.50 Total: $3,803,895.99 Last year to date: $4,302,646.29\nHOW TO HELP\nChecks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245, or any of these organizations:\nBROOKLYN BUREAU OF COMMUNITY SERVICE 285 Schermerhorn Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES, DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS 191 Joralemon Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK 1011 First Avenue New York, N.Y. 10022\nCHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nFEDERATION OF PROTESTANT WELFARE AGENCIES 281 Park Avenue South New York, N.Y. 10010\nUJA-FEDERATION OF NEW YORK Church Street Station P.O.

1815791	Woman Killed And Her Son Is Wounded In L.I. Home	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E5D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	A mother and her adult son were shot inside their family's basement apartment in Coram, N.Y., on Saturday, the police said. She was killed and he was badly wounded.\nThe woman, Amelia Garcia, and her son, Ferneliz Cruz, were found in the kitchen of the apartment on Marie Lane, an otherwise quiet dead-end street in a working-class Suffolk County town of 35,000 residents, about 50 miles east of New York City.\nMs. Garcia, 52, and Mr. Cruz, 30, were the only ones in the white two-family Cape at the time of the shooting, said Detective Sgt. Edward Fandrey of the Suffolk County Police.\nThere were no signs of forced entry and the apartment had not been ransacked, Sergeant Fandrey said. Mr. Cruz lived there with his mother, his wife and their two children, an 8-year-old boy and a baby, according to neighbors and the police. Another family lives on the first floor.\nMr. Cruz's wife, Yesenia Hernandez, called 911 at 8:20 p.m., when she returned home with the children, the police said. She found her wounded husband lying on the kitchen floor near his mother, who was dead, the police said.\n''This is a normal family, by all accounts, that has been thrust into a tragedy,'' Sergeant Fandrey said.\nMr. Cruz was listed in critical condition last night at Stony Brook University Hospital, the police said. He works for a Wonder Bread distributor and his wife has a part-time job with McDonald's, Sergeant Fandrey said.\nInvestigators were still not sure if more than one gunman took part in the shooting or if anything had been stolen from the apartment.\n''We're still processing the scene and we're continuing to evaluate the evidence as we go, but at this point, we don't know the motive,'' Sergeant Fandrey said yesterday afternoon.\nThere are only 10 houses on Marie Lane, but neighbors said that they did not know Mr. Cruz or his family well. They have lived for two years in the basement apartment, which has three windows and a single entrance, a side door down a few narrow steps.\nOne neighbor, Denise Galloway, who has lived on the block for 17 years, said that her son often played with Mr. Cruz's son as Mr. Cruz's mother, Ms. Garcia, stood watch. Ms. Galloway and Ms. Garcia were not able to hold a conversation, though; a native Spanish speaker, Ms. Garcia could not speak English.\nSergeant Fandrey would not disclose the number of shots fired inside the apartment or the type of gun or guns used in the assault. He also did not comment on how many times Mr. Cruz and Ms. Garcia had been shot, or where they had been hit. ''It's all part of the investigation,'' he said.\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Suffolk County Homicide Squad at (631) 852-6392. The calls are kept confidential, the police said.
1815792	Russia-Belarus Gas Deal Averts Feared Disruptions in Europe	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE5D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	As a New Year's deadline arrived, Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, struck a deal early Monday to supply gas to Belarus for the next five years, averting a price dispute that threatened to disrupt supplies to Europe, the company said in a statement.\nThe agreement, reached as the Russian capital celebrated the New Year with rolling displays of fireworks, more than doubled the price that Belarus will pay for natural gas this year and raised it significantly in the years to come.\nFor Belarus, a close ally of Russia, the price of gas would rise to $100 per thousand cubic meters in 2007, from $46 now, and increase steadily to the level paid by European countries by 2011, the company said.\nGazprom, Russia's largest company, succeeded in achieving, at least in part, what its officials had described as a central goal: ending subsidized supplies of energy to the countries of the former Soviet Union. Belarus, led by its autocratic president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, has for years benefited from the comparatively inexpensive supply of natural gas, a vital part of its sclerotic economy, still mostly managed by the state.\nThe agreement headed off a shutdown of supplies to Belarus and beyond, avoiding the disruptions of last year, when the effects of a price dispute with Ukraine rippled throughout Europe and raised concerns about Russia's reliability as an energy supplier.\nGazprom, closely allied to the Kremlin, threatened to cut off gas supplies again beginning Monday at 10 a.m. if Belarus did not agree to the higher prices. At least 20 percent of Russian natural gas destined for Europe passes through Belarus, less than the amount that transits Ukraine but enough to raise new concerns in Europe.\nThe agreement was reached after months of negotiations -- and a final week of threats and counterthreats. Belarus's prime minister, Sergei S. Sidorsky, arrived in Moscow on Sunday for a last round of negotiations and announced the deal with Gazprom's chairman, Aleksei B. Miller. Mr. Miller had suggested that Belarus should ultimately pay the going market price, now roughly $260 per thousand cubic meters of gas.\nThe agreed price, $100 per thousand cubic meters, was less than the $105 that Gazprom had demanded in the past few days. But under the deal announced on Monday, Gazprom, in keeping with its stated goals of expanding its export empire, will acquire 50 percent of Beltranzgaz, the Belarussian gas-transit monopoly that distributes gas through the country.\nMr. Lukashenko, whose rule has been described as the last dictatorship in Europe, had previously vowed never to give up control of those pipelines. On Friday, he vowed that Belarussians would rather live in unheated dugouts than pay the higher prices that Gazprom was demanding. ''All this means destruction of our relations,'' he said.\nA statement by Mr. Sidorsky early Monday appeared to reflect his government's unease with the agreement. ''The Belarussian side, in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year, signed an agreement on unfortunate terms,'' he said, according to Agence France-Presse.\nRussia has long been the country's most reliable partner, shielding it from efforts by Europe and the United States to isolate Mr. Lukashenko, who won re-election to a third term as president in balloting in March that was denounced as unfair. But the negotiations suggested that Russia's political priorities had been surpassed by Gazprom's economic ones.
1815793	Bombs in Bangkok Kill 2 and Wound More Than 30	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E4D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Nine small bombs exploded around Bangkok overnight, killing two people and wounding 34 people in a city that remains under martial law after a coup three months ago. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.\nNew Year's celebrations were officially canceled in Bangkok and in the northern city of Chiang Mai. But when midnight struck, cheers went up in Bangkok and the sky was filled with bursts of fireworks.\nSix of those wounded were foreigners, the police said, including one American.\nThe national police chief said he doubted that Muslim insurgents from southern Thailand were involved in the bombings, leaving the likelihood that the violence was tied to the country's continuing political tensions.\nThaksin Shinawatra was ousted as prime minister in a nonviolent coup on Sept. 19, and the junta has said there is a continuing threat of instability from his backers. The civilian government it appointed approved funds last week for a 14,000-member special operations force to maintain civic order.\n''The bombs exploded almost simultaneously,'' said Gen. Surayud Chulanont, the interim prime minister, as he visited the wounded at a hospital on Sunday. ''It must have been planned.'' But he said it was too early to conclude who was responsible.\nPolice officers were sent to guard the sites of the bombings and to secure other possible targets. Hotels tightened security, shopping malls closed early and the police cleared Khao San Road, a street that is closed to traffic where backpackers from around the world gather to celebrate the New Year.\nThe national police chief, Gen. Ajirawit Suphanaphesat, said that at least six bombs had exploded and that the police were inspecting suspicious packages in several other areas.\nOfficials said two people had been killed and as many as 26 wounded in scattered locations that included a bus stop, a parking area near a shopping mall, a small open market and two police posts.\nBangkok's mayor, Apirak Kosayothin, closed a New Year's celebration in a public square more than three hours early and said other public countdowns would also be canceled.\n''Due to several bomb explosions in Bangkok and for the sake of peace and security, I would ask all of you to return to your homes now,'' he told a crowd of 5,000 people. The police then began clearing the square.\nCrowds remained in the streets for some time, however, waving at the cameras from behind television reporters at the scenes of some of the bombings.\n''Police reinforcements have been sent to various areas in the city,'' said the government's spokesman, Yongyuth Malyalarp. ''We urge the public to remain calm, continue with the celebration but at the same time keep a lookout for any irregularities.''\nAn insurgency in the three largely Muslim provinces of southern Thailand has taken more than 1,900 lives over the past two years. Shootings and bombings have become an almost daily occurrence. But so far, the violence from that insurgency appears not to have spread to Bangkok and other parts of the country.\nThe southern violence appears to have a number of causes. The ethnic Malay Muslims have complained over the years of neglect and discrimination by officials in the distant capital in this largely Buddhist nation.\nThailand's political crisis did not end with the coup, which brought to a halt a period of mounting tension that included large demonstrations against the prime minister earlier in the year.\nMr. Thaksin was abroad at the time, and the question of his possible return continues to preoccupy people here. The junta has said its interim government will draw up a new constitution in preparation for an election late next year.\nBut it has delayed lifting martial law, saying unidentified ''undercurrents'' of pro-Thaksin opposition continue to present a threat.\nAbhisit Vejjajiva, the leader of the minority Democrat Party, said Saturday that he expected Mr. Thaksin's supporters to step up political attacks on the military-backed government in the coming year.\nHe referred to recent accusations of corruption against General Surayud, the interim prime minister, and said, ''Such fighting will be more fierce next year.''
1815794	S.U.V. Kills Boxer, 28, In a Dispute Outside a Bar	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E4D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	A professional boxer was killed in the Bronx early yesterday when a barroom argument spilled outside and one of the men involved drove his sport utility vehicle into a group of people on the sidewalk, the police and witnesses said.\nThe fight began inside the Moonlight Restaurant and Bar on Belmont Avenue in Belmont, apparently brought on by arguments over which Albanian clan was superior, witnesses said.\nThe boxer, Kemal Kolenovic, 28, was not involved in the argument, which started about 4:30 a.m.; he had stepped outside to see what the fight was about, the police said.\n''He was trying to break up the fight,'' said Tony Mujoovic, 35, the victim's uncle. ''They were drinking. That's a big part of it, I think.''\nAt some point, the police said, one of the men climbed into a dark S.U.V. and plowed into the crowd on the sidewalk. The man, thought to be a regular at the bar, fled in the S.U.V. and remained at large last evening, the police said.\nMr. Kolenovic had his back to the vehicle when he was struck, and was thrown head-first into a tree, his friends and the police said. He was pronounced dead shortly afterward at St. Barnabas Hospital.\nMr. Kolenovic, an ethnic Albanian, was originally from Montenegro, moving to Brooklyn in 1993, Mr. Mujoovic said, adding, ''He was a very good person. Everybody likes him.''\nDescribed as aggressive in the ring, Mr. Kolenovic, 5 feet 7 inches tall, fought in the welterweight division with a record of 10 wins, six losses and two draws, according to boxing records.\nHe won his last fight by a technical knockout at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y., on Dec. 15, and had hoped to fight at the Loews Paradise Theater in the Bronx on Jan. 25, lacking only an opponent, said Tony Kalaj, a spokesman for the fight's promoter, Joe DeGuardia Star Boxing.\n''He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He went outside just to see what was going on,'' Mr. Kalaj said. ''He was going to start serious training on Tuesday.''\nEven a defeat won Mr. Kolenovic fans in Reading, Pa., where he lost a split decision at the Sovereign Center there last May, according to Don Stewart, who covers boxing for The Reading Eagle.\nThere were boos when the decision was announced, Mr. Stewart said. ''It was such a good fight, he got a little bit of a fan base here,'' he added. ''They wanted him to come back.\n''He was real charismatic in the ring. He would jump up and down in the corner before the rounds. He was a real tough little guy. It's a boxing cliché, but he was a hard-luck journeyman who couldn't get a break. He had fights that could have gone his way but didn't for whatever reason.''\nHis trainer of nine years, Raymond Paolillo, 78, said the boxer was in the process of moving to the Bronx, where he trained, and that his skills in the ring were improving.\n''He was a tough fighter. Bob and weave,'' Mr. Paolillo said outside the bar, with tears in his eyes. ''I miss him a lot. He was a high-strung kid and a nice kid. A tough kid,'' he said. ''The party's over.''
1815795	Wave of Development, Cleared for Takeoff	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E4D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	City, state and federal agencies granted final approvals last month to a half-dozen wide-ranging projects in a political aligning of the stars that will promote New York City's most ambitious economic development agenda in decades.\nApproval or financing was given to a Second Avenue subway; an extension of the Flushing Line to the Far West Side; a spur to connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal; financing for tens of thousands of apartments for low- and moderate-income residents; the Atlantic Yards complex near Downtown Brooklyn, which includes a new home for the basketball Nets; and even the bus-stop shelters and public toilets that New Yorkers and visitors have demanded for years.\nSome of the approvals were prompted by legal deadlines and last-minute efforts by departing Pataki administration officials -- including Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation; Peter S. Kalikow, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; and the governor himself -- to stake out their legacy.\nBut two more enduring forces also converged: the beginning of the last 1,000 days of the Bloomberg administration, and a climate that some urban planners suggest signals at least a lull in the nearly half-century backlash against the bulldozer diplomacy of Robert Moses.\n''It's a pretty amazing list,'' said Robert D. Yaro, the president of the Regional Plan Association, a group that studies transportation and development issues. ''It's the Bloomberg administration pushing hard. There's a pro-growth, long-range theme behind all this.''\nKenneth T. Jackson, the Columbia University urban historian, said that Mr. Bloomberg's speech in December outlining the challenges posed by a growing population ''signaled that New York had to fight for its place at the table, that real estate and commercial rents and housing prices are getting out of hand. The only way the city can prosper is to make that more reasonable and the only way to do that is to increase the supply.\n''I think they're beginning to move,'' Professor Jackson said.\nIn the months ahead, the Bloomberg administration's development agenda includes rezoning in Harlem as well as in Jamaica and Willets Point in Queens. The administration also wants to make another effort to gain approval for the transformation of the James A. Farley general post office building in Midtown Manhattan into a commuter rail hub called Moynihan Station -- one proposal that appears to be in political limbo.\n''After 9/11, a spirit of cooperation -- not perfect -- prevailed that enabled people to aim farther than they had in decades,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, who was instrumental in winning many of the approvals. ''The mayor really encouraged that kind of thinking -- repositioning New York City's economy to compete with other cities in the 21st century.''\nSeveral of the approved projects still face court challenges. Some others are bound to raise concerns over displacement and congestion. And the promise of a Second Avenue subway has been dangled before skeptical New Yorkers for nearly 80 years. But even if some projects are delayed, the others would change the city's face and, arguably, help fend off competition from New Jersey and from other world capitals.\n''I think you probably would have to go back to the late 1930s to see anything like that,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''I don't think any mayor has had an agenda like this, not since La Guardia.''\nOn Dec. 6, the city sold $2 billion in bonds to extend the No. 7 subway line 1.1 miles west and then south from Times Square to 11th Avenue and 34th Street to help transform the largely fallow Far West Side.\nOn Dec. 18, the federal government agreed to grant $2.6 billion to link Long Island Rail Road commuters directly to the East Side of Manhattan and $693 million for the Second Avenue subway from 96th to 63rd Streets.\nOn Dec. 19, Mr. Pataki presided over the installation of the first two huge steel columns to mark the perimeter of the Freedom Tower at the World Trade Center site.\nThe same day, Mr. Bloomberg announced the installation of the first 24 of 3,300 bus-stop shelters by a company that will also replace 330 newsstands and install and operate 20 public toilets. The ''street furniture'' will help pay for the city's tourism campaign.\nOn Dec. 20, the City Council, in a compromise supported by the mayor, voted to overhaul a tax break to induce developers to build tens of thousands of apartments for New Yorkers making less than 80 percent of the median household income, or $56,720 for a family of four.\nThat day, a state oversight board gave final approval to the $4 billion Atlantic Yards project, a mostly residential complex with a basketball arena, offices and retail space near Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues.\nIn addition, new stadiums are being built for the Yankees and the Mets.\nBrad Lander, the director of the Pratt Center for Community Development, a planning group, said: ''My guess is, we are only just now settling into the general sense that the city's growth and development are long-term trends, not a short-time, business-cycle flash.''\nDick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, said that the city, bolstered by a robust economy, was trying to meet pent-up demand.\n''Say what you want about the scope and size of development,'' he added, ''the projects that are being approved are more sensitive to the current communities and neighborhoods or to creating new ones -- like the new Downtown Brooklyn -- than Moses ever was.''\nMoreover, Mr. Dadey said, ''the community boards no longer have the sway they once did over stopping local projects,'' and some local groups are even supporting development -- ''trying to encourage it responsibly in ways that benefit a greater number of people.''\nIn ''The Power Broker,'' Robert A. Caro in 1974 wrote that without the approval of Robert Moses, who oversaw virtually all public works in New York until he was eased out in 1968, the city was ''utterly unable'' to build anything.\nMr. Caro said in an interview that he, too, was struck by the plethora of projects approved in December.\n''Does this alignment of stars show that this is may be a problem that democracy can solve?'' he said. ''For the first time in 40 years, I'm hopeful.''
1815796	Today's Games	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E4D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Penn State (8-4) vs. Tennessee (9-3) Outback Bowl, Tampa, Fla., 11 a.m., ESPN The possible return of Penn State Coach Joe Paterno to the sideline will be the dominant story line in this battle between two traditional powers.The 80-year old Paterno fractured his shinbone and tore two knee ligaments in during a loss at Wisconsin in November. He'll return for his 22nd New Year's Day Bowl game. He enters with a 15-6 record. Tennessee, which did not play in a bowl game last season, is looking for a chance to put an exclamation point on a recovery year.\nAuburn (10-2) vs. Nebraska (9-4) Cotton Bowl, Dallas, 11:30 a.m., Channel 5 Auburn, which beat Florida and Louisiana State, could be the best team not playing in a Bowl Championship Series game. Auburn is 32-5 the past three seasons. Only Southern California and Texas have been better. For Nebraska, this game provides another chance to show that the program is inching back toward prominence under Bill Callahan. The Cornhuskers won the Big 12 North for the first time since 1999, and their 9-4 record is the best since Callahan took over as the coach three years ago.\nWisconsin (11-1) vs. Arkansas (10-3) Capital One Bowl, Orlando, Fla., 1 p.m., Channel 7 You may not see two better young tailbacks on the field at the same time all season. The Arkansas sophomore tailback Darren McFadden will be a heavy favorite to win the Heisman Trophy next season after rushing for 1,558 yards and 14 touchdowns. McFadden, who often lines up at quarterback to confuse defenses, has also thrown three touchdowns passes. Wisconsin features the freshman star P.J. Hill, who led the Big Ten with 1,533 yards and 15 touchdowns. Hill is the latest in a long line of plodding but powerful Badgers backs.\nGeorgia Tech (9-4) vs. West Virginia (10-2) Gator Bowl, Jacksonville, Fla., 1 p.m., Channel 2 The Yellow Jackets will be without their senior quarterback Reggie Ball because of academic reasons. Tech fans who have watched Ball flutter passes for four seasons may think that's a good thing. Two November losses ended West Virginia's national title hopes. Look for a blowout win today to fuel the hype for the Mountaineers to be a title favorite next season. It will be interesting to see, however, how an underrated Tech defense can handle West Virginia's dangerous spread attack.\nSouthern California (10-2) vs. Michigan (11-1) Rose Bowl, Pasadena, Calif., 5 p.m., Channel 7 Both teams have been persistent in saying it is not a letdown to play in the Rose Bowl. If that is true, this could be the best game of the bowl season. Southern California is out to prove that its offensive gridlock against U.C.L.A. was a fluke. Michigan clearly has a better defense than the Bruins, who followed their upset of the Trojans by being trounced by a mediocre Florida State team in the Emerald Bowl. The Wolverines are coming off a 42-39 loss at Ohio State, but they appear to have more talent that the Trojans.\nBoise State (12-0) vs. Oklahoma (11-2) Fiesta Bowl, Glendale, Ariz., 8 p.m., Channel 5 After Rhett Bomar was booted from the team in August, the referees robbed Oklahoma of a September game at Oregon and Adrian Peterson broke his collarbone in October, things could have fallen apart for the Sooners. Instead, they have put together perhaps the most impressive season in the Bob Stoops era, considering the circumstances. Peterson is expected to return for the game. They will face an undefeated Boise State team that is getting its first crack at an elite team since losing, 48-13, at Georgia to open last season. If Boise, from the Western Athletic Conference, pulls off the upset and completes an undefeated season, it will cap one of the most surprising seasons in recent college football history.\nPETE THAMEL\nAll times Eastern.\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL

The host Titans (8-8) had won six games in a row and needed to beat the Patriots and hope the Jaguars, Bengals and Broncos lost. All three did, but the Titans proved no match for the Patriots (12-4), who will play the Jets in a wild-card game Sunday.\nWith New Orleans (10-6) set to play host to its first playoff game in the rebuilt Superdome in two weeks, Coach Sean Payton removed several key players early in the Saints' 31-21 loss to the visiting Panthers. Quarterback Drew Brees played only one full series and was 4 of 5 for 46 yards. Reggie Bush rushed for an early touchdown but played little more than a quarter, and running back Deuce McAllister had the day off. Carolina finished 8-8.\nShaun Alexander rushed for 92 yards and scored on a 1-yard run in the first quarter as the Seahawks defeated the Buccaneers, 23-7. Visiting Seattle (9-7) had little to play for after clinching the National Football Conference West title; they will play host to Dallas in the first round Saturday. Tampa Bay finished 4-12.\nChargers and Ravens Finish 1-2 in A.F.C.\nPhilip Rivers threw two touchdown passes after spraining his right foot, and LaDainian Tomlinson also limped off after wrapping up his first rushing title as the Chargers defeated the visiting Cardinals, 27-20. The Chargers (14-2), who have won 10 in a row, clinched home-field advantage throughout the American Football Conference playoffs. Rivers and Tomlinson, who had one of his legs stepped on, said they would have played if the result had been more important, but the Chargers had already earned a first-round bye. Tomlinson ran for 66 yards, giving him 1,815 this season. Arizona finished 5-11.\nUsing a stellar performance from the defense and an efficient effort from the offense, the Ravens beat the Bills, 19-7, to earn the No. 2 seeding in the A.F.C. Chris McAlister returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown and the host Ravens (13-3) allowed only 39 yards rushing. Buffalo finished 7-9.\nColts Finish Strong, but Cowboys Do Not\nPeyton Manning threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score as the Colts held on to beat the visiting Dolphins, 27-22. Manning's two scoring passes gave him 275 in his career, moving him ahead of Joe Montana into seventh on the career list. Indianapolis (12-4), which blew a chance to earn a first-round bye by losing four times in the previous six weeks, will play host to Kansas City in a wild-card game Saturday. Cleo Lemon was solid in his first N.F.L. start for Miami (6-10), finishing 18 of 36 for 210 yards.\nDone in by repeated mistakes from quarterback Tony Romo and a few more by cornerback Terence Newman, the Cowboys lost To the visiting Lions, 39-31, and blew their chance to stay alive in the N.F.C. East race. ''I can't tell you how disappointed I am, I really can't,'' Cowboys Coach Bill Parcells said. As much as Dallas (9-7) wanted to win the game, Detroit (3-13) might have been better off losing it. By winning, they gave the Raiders the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. But even the Lions could not refuse the gifts the Cowboys gave them, from a penalty on Newman that wiped out an interception return for a touchdown on the game's first snap to Romo's two fumbles and an interception.\nIn Other Games\nSteven Jackson had a career-high 4 touchdowns and 142 yards rushing, helping the visiting Rams defeat the Vikings, 41-21. Jackson's 59-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter prevented Minnesota (6-10) from establishing a postmerger N.F.L. record for fewest yards rushing allowed in a season. They missed by 15 the mark of 970 yards set by the Ravens in 2000. The Rams finished 8-8.\nDespite losing running back Ron Dayne (ankle) and tight end Jeb Putzier (broken foot) to injuries in pregame warm-ups, the Texans defeated the visiting Browns, 14-6. Houston (6-10) won back-to-back games for the first time since 2004 and tripled its victory total from last season. Cleveland finished 4-12.\nPRO FOOTBALL

1815800	Cross-Check Brings Orr Five-Game Suspension	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E2D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The National Hockey League suspended Rangers right wing Colton Orr for five games yesterday for cross-checking the Washington Capitals star Alexander Ovechkin in the head late in the Rangers' 4-1 victory Saturday night at Madison Square Garden.\nOrr was involved in two fights, the second of which followed his hit of Ovechkin with 4 minutes 20 seconds left. Ovechkin, tied with Martin St. Louis of Tampa Bay for the league lead with 25 goals through Saturday, was not hurt.\n''The Rangers player's actions with his stick were reckless and dangerous,'' Colin Campbell, the N.H.L.'s senior executive vice president for hockey operations, said in a statement released by the league. ''Although no injury resulted, the action is unacceptable.''\nThe league also suspended Washington left wing Donald Brashear for one game for punching Rangers defenseman Aaron Ward after Brashear fought left wing Brendan Shanahan with 12:21 left.\nBrashear, a notorious enforcer, was ejected for attempting to cause a deliberate injury. Ward later acknowledged that he might have provoked Brashear by asking what he called an obvious question -- perhaps why Brashear was fighting Shanahan, who is not known as a fighter.\nExcept for a scrape on his chin, Shanahan escaped unharmed. And although he absorbed a beating from Brashear, he made a point.\n''When your leaders do things like that, clearly it demonstrates that they're willing to pay any price to win,'' Rangers Coach Tom Renney said after the Rangers ended a seven-game losing streak. ''That's how badly he wanted us to get out of what we'd been through seven times.''\nThe Rangers had three major penalties for fighting, their highest total since Feb. 26, 2004, when they had three in a 6-3 victory against the Islanders.\nFighting is practically passé in the post-lockout N.H.L. But the Rangers wanted to prove to their opponents -- and probably to themselves -- that they were not going to be passive, especially in the third period after blowing late leads to Florida and Tampa Bay in consecutive games during the losing streak.\nRenney noted that the brutish Brashear matched shifts with Jagr, the Rangers' highest-paid and most valuable player. Shanahan picked a fight with Brashear after he elbowed Jaromir Jagr in the face after a face-off.\nJagr, the Rangers' captain, said of Shanahan, ''He is not only about big goals, but he protects his players.''\nThe Rangers (19-17-4), who face the Devils on Tuesday in East Rutherford, N.J., played with intensity from the start Saturday.\nDefenseman Darius Kasparaitis drove Ovechkin to the ice with a hard check two minutes into the game. The collision led to a goal seconds later by Petr Prucha. The Rangers led, 3-0, after two periods.\n''The game was about us coming out with the first period the way we did, and the things that happened in the third period are secondary.'' Shanahan said.\nOrr challenged Brashear to a fight 12 minutes into the game, even throwing down his gloves, but Brashear left the ice in a line change after a face-off.\nOrr finally squared off with Brashear with less than a minute left in the second period, and Brashear slammed him to the ice. Although he had not been in a fight since March 30, Shanahan soon took his turn.\n''I am a little out of practice, but it is still fun when you are in them,'' Shanahan said.\nHOCKEY
1815801	Investigators Long Retired Carry Burden of an Unsolved Case and Its Nameless Victim	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E0D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	For a half-century, he has been the center of a heartbreaking mystery, this boy of 4 or 5 who lies buried beneath a black granite stone in the shade of rhododendrons.\nVisitors to his grave in Ivy Hill Cemetery here pray and leave toys, perhaps bestowing more love on this child than he ever had in his life, which was marked by sickness and hunger and ended in a beating.\nThe boy's body, bruised and naked, was found in a cardboard box in a patch of woods off a dirt road on the city's outskirts in February 1957. He was a symbol of child abuse at its worst. Yet all these years later, he has no name.\nWilliam H. Kelly, a retired Philadelphia detective, and his friend Joseph McGillen, a retired investigator for the medical examiner's office, visit the boy's grave often. ''My little friend,'' Mr. Kelly calls him. The men, both 79, dream of giving the boy an identity before they die.\nStill officially an open homicide investigation, the case is ''one of the very few in which we can't say who it is,'' said Capt. Benjamin Naish, a Philadelphia police spokesman.\nElmer Palmer was the first officer on the scene that drizzly Feb. 26, 1957. ''It looked like a doll,'' he recalled recently. ''Then I saw it wasn't a doll.'' The boy's hair had been cut, crudely, either just before or just after death, so his body was flecked with hairs.\nMr. Palmer, now 79, was a young husband and father then. He recalled shivering in his raincoat, thinking, ''What a shame.'' At least this will be solved quickly, he thought. ''They had so many leads.''\nBut there were problems. A college student had spotted the body on Feb. 25, but did not call the police until the next day, after confiding in a priest. Cold slows decomposition, so it was impossible to tell how long the boy had been dead.\nAn autopsy showed that the child had been beaten to death and that he had been ill and undernourished. His baby teeth were intact, and he had apparently never been to a dentist. His body bore several small scars that looked like surgical incisions. Yet a survey of local doctors and hospitals turned up nothing. Photographs of the boy's face were printed in the newspapers, hung on storefronts and mailed with utility bills throughout Philadelphia and beyond. Orphanages and other child-care institutions were checked. Still nothing.\nDetectives even dressed the corpse and photographed it in a sitting position, then distributed the pictures in the hope that the more ''lifelike'' appearance would jog someone's memory.\nA man's corduroy cap found near the body was traced to an area store. The owner recognized it from the strap the buyer had her sew on. She recalled him as a man in his 20s who had come into the store alone. There was nothing special about him. He was never found. The police traced the cardboard box to another store. It was one of a dozen that had held bassinets sold from Dec. 3, 1956, to Feb. 16, 1957. Investigators tracked down all but one buyer -- quite a feat, considering the store's cash-only policy -- but found no link to the boy.\nAmong the many tips and theories: the boy was a refugee who came to America after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; he was the son of wandering carnival workers, several of whose children had died under odd circumstances; he was the son of an itinerant roofer who had worked in the Philadelphia area.\nMore than 11,000 Hungarian passports were checked. The carnival workers were cleared. The roofer was found, along with his son, safe and sound.\nFinally, the boy was buried in a potter's field, with detectives as pallbearers. His grave was the only one with a stone, donated by a local monument maker.\nYears went by. The patch of woods was bulldozed for houses; the dirt road became a busy street. Investigators who had worked on the case acquired paunches and pensions. But for all the big-city death and mayhem they had seen, they could not forget the little boy.\nThe Vidocq Society, a Philadelphia group composed largely of law enforcement professionals who investigate long-unsolved crimes, adopted the case. Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGillen are members. (The society is named after a famed 18th-century French detective, Eugène François Vidocq.)\nAnother member was Remington Bristow, an investigator in the medical examiner's office who had been deeply affected by the case. His own son had died in early childhood.\nMr. Bristow worked on the case practically full time, even in his retirement, spending thousands of dollars of his own to chase leads across the country. He carried a death mask of the child in his briefcase.\nUntil his death in 1993, Mr. Bristow theorized that the child was the son of an unmarried daughter of a couple who ran a foster home in an old mansion. He even suggested that the child might have died accidentally.\nThe boy's D.N.A. was obtained when the body was exhumed in 1998 and reburied in Ivy Hill, in a plot donated by the cemetery. Those close to the case hold out hope that a match will turn up one day.\nMr. Kelly and Mr. McGillen say the key to the mystery may lie in the memory of a woman who grew up in Philadelphia and says that when she was a child her parents brought a boy home and kept him in the basement. One day, the woman says, her mother battered the boy to death, then drove with her to the patch of woods to dispose of the body.\nThe woman told her story to Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGillen several years ago, in the presence of her psychiatrist. She said she decided to come forward after a television reprise of the case, one of several in recent years.\n''We think she's the real deal,'' Mr. McGillen said.\nBut William Fleisher, a former Philadelphia police officer and F.B.I. agent who is the president of the Vidocq Society, is not so sure. ''Nothing she says has been proved, nothing she says has been disproved,'' said Mr. Fleisher, now a private investigator.\nAnd if the boy remains without a name and the crime goes unpunished? Sooner or later the killer will be ''in a place where there's no appeal,'' Mr. McGillen said. ''And I feel good about that.''
1815802	Songwriter's Death Leads to Suits Against Preacher	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E0D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Darlene Bishop, the nationally renowned evangelical preacher, begins her book about how God cured the cancer afflicting one of her brothers with a Biblical verse: ''And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up.''\nThe book, ''Your Life Follows Your Words,'' is sold in the gift shop of Solid Rock Church, the 4,000-member congregation in Monroe, Ohio, where Ms. Bishop is a co-pastor. She has promoted it on her television show, ''Sisters,'' which is modeled after ABC's ''The View'' and is broadcast on four cable networks nationwide.\nOn her Web site, Ms. Bishop promises that the book reveals ''how God healed her of breast cancer'' and a brother of throat cancer.\nNowhere, though, does she mention, that the brother, Darrell Perry, a successful country music songwriter whom everyone called Wayne, died from the cancer a year and a half ago.\nIn a sworn deposition responding to two lawsuits filed by Mr. Perry's four children, Ms. Bishop stated that no doctor ever diagnosed the breast cancer she referred to prominently in her book. Instead, Ms. Bishop testified, she thought that she had cancer in 1986 and that it was cured.\n''She's lying to people and exploiting my father for her own financial gain,'' Mr. Perry's eldest son, Bryan Perry, 36, said in an interview.\nOne lawsuit accuses Ms. Bishop of wrongful death because, it says, she convinced Mr. Perry to pray rather than to seek medical care. The other accuses her of mismanaging and misusing his estate, which the Perry children say could be worth millions. The estate case is to be argued in Butler County Probate Court on Friday.\nMr. Perry's death at age 55 left some of country music's most popular performers, including Toby Keith and Tim McGraw, without one of their most trusted and prolific writers. Now the battle over who caused his death, who owns his assets and how best to interpret his legacy is dividing a once-close family whose members climbed from Appalachian poverty to prominence in the music industry and the evangelical movement.\nMs. Bishop would not answer questions about the suits. On her Web site, she says that the allegations ''are complete lies'' and that she never discourages anyone from seeing doctors. She also says she is a trustworthy steward of Mr. Perry's estate, which, she said in the deposition, could be worth nothing after his many debts are paid.\nLong before she gained fame as a preacher, Ms. Bishop was her family's spiritual leader, Bryan Perry said.\nOne of Mr. Perry's two former wives, Janet Perry-McCormick, said that he often sought the religious counsel of his older sister, whom he called Sissy, and that his children grew up attending her church.\n''I put my faith in Darlene,'' Bryan Perry said. ''We all did. We thought she was a holy, pure woman.''\nWayne Perry fathered four children with three women, two of whom he married, his sons said. He abandoned his family when Bryan was 2 to pursue his songwriting career, which produced such hits as ''A Woman's Touch,'' recorded by Mr. Keith, and ''Not a Moment Too Soon,'' by Mr. McGraw. He earned millions of dollars, said a music industry lawyer, Rush Hicks, who is advising the children.\nAfter doctors diagnosed his throat cancer in December 2002, Mr. Perry moved into Ms. Bishop's mansion on her $2.6 million horse farm in Monroe to re-commit his life to God, his sons said.\nAccording to Ms. Bishop's book, when her brother arrived at her front door, he confirmed that he had cancer, and she replied, ''Let that be the last time those words ever come from your mouth.''\nIn her deposition, Ms. Bishop said Mr. Perry had decided on his own to disregard doctors' advice that he immediately begin chemotherapy and radiation treatments. But Mr. Perry's children contend that their aunt persuaded him to forgo medical treatment and rely on a process of faith healing that, Ms. Bishop wrote in her book, God had explained to her in a revelation.\n''He was laying in bed dying, and she had him convinced that he was healed,'' said Mr. Perry's son Justin Jones, 28, who lived in Ms. Bishop's house for a year caring for his father.\nAs his throat tumors swelled to the size of tennis balls, Mr. Perry stopped eating, Mr. Jones said. His weight dropped to 84 pounds. He did consent to chemotherapy, Mr. Jones said, but only after the tumors had restricted his breathing to the point that he collapsed. The chemotherapy shrank the tumors, Mr. Jones said, and his father began eating again.\nIn her book, Ms. Bishop describes her brother's spiritual awakening and the improvement in his condition, but she does not mention his chemotherapy.\nAs Mr. Perry regained strength, he and Ms. Bishop went on a nationwide tour of evangelical churches, promoting Ms. Bishop's book about his miraculous recovery, his children said. Against his doctor's advice, Mr. Perry stopped chemotherapy, Mr. Jones said.\nOn Oct. 13, 2004, an oncologist, Dr. Albert Malcolm, wrote a letter telling Mr. Perry that his cancer was terminal. Mr. Perry forwarded the letter to Janet Perry-McCormick, his former wife, after writing across the top, ''Destroy this letter after you read it,'' and, ''Only you and Darlene know this.''\nThe note is proof that Ms. Bishop knew her brother was dying but concealed it from the public while continuing to promote her book, Mr. Perry's children said in interviews, but in her deposition, Ms. Bishop said she learned of Dr. Malcolm's diagnosis after Mr. Perry died in May 2005.\nMr. Perry's death raised questions about the ownership of his royalties, his catalogs of songs and his ''hook book,'' which his children describe as a loose-leaf notebook stuffed with lyrics and musical riffs, most of which had not been recorded. The children accused Ms. Bishop's son Lawrence Bishop II, a musician, of recording two albums that contained a total of five songs copyrighted by Mr. Perry without paying royalties to his estate.\nCopyrights are not strictly followed in the Christian country music business, Ms. Bishop said in her deposition. She also said Mr. Perry's notebook was missing. Their father's songs could be worth millions of dollars, the children said, but only if they can be marketed, an impossibility given no hook book and a dispute over song rights.\nMs. Bishop said Mr. Perry's catalogs of songs belonged to the record companies that recorded and promoted them, not the family.\nAlso in dispute is Mr. Perry's life insurance policy, worth $260,000. Ms. Bishop was named the policy's sole beneficiary, but the children claim it was meant for them.\nOne point on which both sides agree is that Mr. Perry died believing he had been healed by God.\n''The only thing he told me,'' Ms. Perry-McCormick said, ''was, 'I'm going to show Sissy that I can be healed just like she was.'

1815803	Chief Justice Advocates Higher Pay for Judiciary	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE0D81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. made judicial pay the sole topic of his second annual report, issued on Sunday, declaring that the failure by Congress to raise federal judges' salaries in recent years has become a ''constitutional crisis'' that puts the future of the federal courts in jeopardy.\nHe noted that judges had fallen well behind the American labor force as a whole in keeping up with inflation over the past 25 years, with judges' pay having declined by 23.9 percent since 1969, adjusted for inflation, while the national average for all wages rose by 17.8 percent.\nGiven such a ''dramatic erosion of judicial compensation,'' the chief justice said, it was ''clear that the time is ripe for our nation's judges to receive a substantial salary increase.''\nHis annual report noted that his predecessor, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, had spoken out on the issue of judicial pay for 20 years. Chief Justice Roberts himself mentioned it, among other topics, a year ago in his first report.\nHe decided to make the subject his sole policy focus this time, he said, in the hope that ''people will take notice'' of a problem that ''has now reached the level of a constitutional crisis that threatens to undermine the strength and independence of the federal judiciary.''\nFederal judges rarely left the bench in the past but are now leaving at an increasing rate, 38 in the past six years, including 17 in the last two years. ''Inadequate compensation directly threatens the viability of life tenure,'' the chief justice said.\nFurther, he noted that judges were increasingly drawn from among lawyers already working in the public sector, often as state court judges or federal magistrate judges. Fewer than 40 percent of new federal district judges come from the private sector, Chief Justice Roberts said, adding, ''It changes the nature of the federal judiciary when judges are no longer drawn primarily from among the best lawyers in the practicing bar.''\nBy statute, federal district judges receive the same salaries as members of Congress, now $165,200 a year. Judges on the federal appeals courts receive $175,100; associate justices of the Supreme Court, $203,000; and the chief justice $212,100. The linkage of district judges' and Congressional salaries means that judges pay the price when members of Congress discern that it would be politically unpopular to raise their own pay.\nThat is not the only problem, from the judges' perspective. Their last substantial pay raise was a 25 percent increase provided by a 1989 law, the Ethics Reform Act, under which judges lost the right to earn most types of outside income in return for the raise and the promise of regular cost-of-living increases. But there were no increases in 5 of the last 13 years. Congress ended its 2006 session without providing a cost-of-living increase for the current fiscal year. ''Congressional inaction in the face of this situation is grievously unfair,'' the chief justice said.\nThe outlook may be somewhat brighter for 2007. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who will take over as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Sunday praised the chief justice's report and said he would ''do what I can to convince Congress to fairly evaluate this issue and the chief's arguments.'' A cost-of-living increase ''should be an early item of business that the new Congress can accomplish,'' Mr. Leahy said.\nMr. Leahy noted that a bill he sponsored four years ago to make up for the missed cost-of-living increases had passed the Senate but failed in the House of Representatives. ''I hope Congress and the president will reconsider such a measure this year and will do their duty when it comes to fair compensation for the independent judiciary,'' he said.\nAs earnings have soared in recent years for lawyers at the top firms, federal judges have found it galling that their own law clerks outstrip them within a year or two of entering private practice. Including salary and year-end bonuses, first-year associates at leading New York City firms earned as much as $175,000 in 2006. On top of that, firms offer a signing bonus of $200,000 to entice Supreme Court law clerks to join their ranks.\nChief Justice Roberts, who earned slightly more than $1 million from his law firm in 2003, his last full year in private practice, said judges did not expect to keep up with what they could earn in private life. ''We do not even talk about comparisons with the practicing bar anymore,'' he said.\nFor the last several years, judges discussing the pay question have pointed to a different benchmark that they regard as a more realistic indicator of how far they have lagged: the difference between judges' pay and the salaries in legal academia.\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer, a former law professor himself, testified in 2002 at a hearing of the National Commission on the Public Service, a private group headed by Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nJustice Breyer presented charts showing that while in 1969, federal district judges earned slightly more than law school deans, $40,000 compared to $33,000, and substantially more than the $28,000 earned by senior law professors, the situation by 2002 was completely reversed. In that year, the judges were earning $150,000, compared to $250,000 for the professors and $325,000 for the deans.

If the seedings hold up, their first game could be a doozy: against New England, whose coach, Bill Belichick, would surely try to confuse quarterback Philip Rivers in his first playoff game, and whose solid run defense would give LaDainian Tomlinson one of his biggest challenges of the season. RECORD -- 14-2 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE\nSEEDING -- 2 TEAM -- Baltimore Ravens (North champions) Baltimore beat Buffalo yesterday, using its fifth interception return for a touchdown to secure the second seeding and a first-round bye. The Ravens have won four in a row and their offense has been energized since Brian Billick took over the play-calling. But a run in the playoffs will still be all about their top-rated defense. Baltimore held the Chargers to 13 points in October to hand San Diego its first loss. RECORD --13-3 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE\nSEEDING -- 3 TEAM -- Indianapolis Colts (South champions) The Colts held off the Dolphins yesterday to secure the third seeding, but the Dolphins, playing a meaningless game, moved down the field with ease late in the fourth quarter, a bad omen for Indianapolis. The defense is not as good as it was last year, and the Colts will go only as far as their porous run defense - the worst in the league - allows them. The Chiefs have a star running back in Larry Johnson, and that could mean another early exit for the Colts. RECORD -- 12-4 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Kansas City\nSEEDING -- 4 TEAM -- New England Patriots (East champions) After an erratic season, the Patriots go into the playoffs on a roll after pounding Vince Young (five sacks, three turnovers) and the Titans yesterday. They remain an intimidating playoff opponent because of Tom Brady, who has had a superb season despite a dearth of receiver talent. But the Jets held the Patriots to 14 points in Foxborough in November. RECORD -- 12-4 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Jets\nSEEDING -- 5 TEAM -- Jets The Jets defeated the Raiders yesterday to secure a wild-card spot, completing a remarkable rookie regular season for Coach Eric Mangini, who took over a team that won only four games last season. The Jets started looking like a serious threat when they beat the Patriots in Foxborough in mid-November. Now they are going back for another visit, another chance for Bill Belichick to offer Mangini a warm welcome back. RECORD -- 10-6 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- New England\nSEEDING -- 6 TEAM -- Kansas City Chiefs The Chiefs snuck in when the Broncos lost to the 49ers in overtime yesterday and Pittsburgh beat Cincinnati. The Chiefs survived Trent Green's severe concussion in the season opener because they leaned heavily on running back Larry Johnson. Coach Herman Edwards will no doubt do that again when he faces his friend Tony Dungy's suspect run defense. RECORD -- 9-7 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Indianapolis\nNATIONAL FOOTBALL CONFERENCE\nSEEDING -- 1 TEAM -- Chicago Bears (North champions) The Bears wrapped up the top seeding long ago on the strength of their dominating defense, rendering last night's game against the Packers meaningless. But the Bears still have not answered the biggest question about a potential run to the Super Bowl: What happens if quarterback Rex Grossman struggles? It is a question that could shape the postseason for the N.F.C., especially if the Bears face the Saints, who have a top-five pass defense, in the conference championship game. RECORD -- 13-3 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE\nSEEDING -- 2 TEAM -- New Orleans Saints (South champions) The Saints, the feel-good story of the season, may also be the most dangerous team in the N.F.C., and after their decimation of the Giants in Week 15, everyone knows it. Drew Brees, Reggie Bush and Deuce McAllister rested for most of the Saints' meaningless loss to the Panthers yesterday. Bush versus Chicago linebacker Brian Urlacher in the conference championship would be a blockbuster. RECORD -- 10-6 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- BYE\nSEEDING -- 3 TEAM -- Philadelphia Eagles (East champions) The Eagles finished the season with five consecutive victories behind the backup quarterback Jeff Garcia, who has been so effective leading a balanced offense that Donovan McNabb's mother is worried about her injured son's future. The Eagles defeated the Giants, 36-22, just two weeks ago, and they seem to be getting stronger and more confident by the week. Their offense, improbably, is in the top five in the league. RECORD -- 10-6 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Giants\nSEEDING -- 4\nTEAM -- Seattle Seahawks (West champions) The Seahawks blew out the Buccaneers in their season finale, but they had lost three in a row before that. They are nowhere near the powerhouse team that went to the Super Bowl last season. And the final game was costly: Cornerback Kelly Herndon broke his left ankle (another cornerback, Marcus Trufant, didn't play because of a sprained ankle) and linebacker Leroy Hill sustained a concussion. RECORD -- 9-7 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Dallas\nSEEDING -- 5 TEAM -- Dallas Cowboys Less than a month ago, the Cowboys had a two-game lead in the N.F.C. East and looked like the best team in the conference. But yesterday, with a chance to win the division, they lost to the Lions at home, their third loss in their final four games. Quarterback Tony Romo was voted into the Pro Bowl, but he has struggled in those three losses. Seattle's Qwest Field is one of the loudest, most difficult stadiums in the league. Seattle's secondary is injury-riddled, so the complaining Dallas receivers should get plenty of action. RECORD -- 9-7 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Seattle\nSEEDING -- 6 TEAM -- Giants The Giants survived a near-complete collapse and rediscovered their offense to sneak into the playoffs with almost no momentum. They played the Eagles close for a while two weeks ago, but their defense was gashed up the middle by the Eagles' rushers. Earlier in the season, the Giants forged an epic comeback to beat the Eagles in Philadelphia. But that was a long time ago, and if they beat the Eagles next week, it will be an even greater comeback for the season. RECORD -- 8-8 1ST-ROUND OPPONENT -- Philadelphia PRO FOOTBALL
1815808	Middle Stance Emerges In Debate Over Climate	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02EFD81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Amid the shouting lately about whether global warming is a human-caused catastrophe or a hoax, some usually staid climate scientists in the usually invisible middle are speaking up.\nThe discourse over the issue has been feverish since Hurricane Katrina. Seizing the moment, many environmental campaigners, former Vice President Al Gore and some scientists have portrayed the growing human influence on the climate as an unfolding disaster that is already measurably strengthening hurricanes, spreading diseases and amplifying recent droughts and deluges.\nConservative politicians and a few scientists, many with ties to energy companies, have variously countered that human-driven warming is inconsequential, unproved or a manufactured crisis.\nA third stance is now emerging, espoused by many experts who challenge both poles of the debate.\nThey agree that accumulating carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe gases probably pose a momentous environmental challenge, but say the appropriate response is more akin to buying fire insurance and installing sprinklers and new wiring in an old, irreplaceable house (the home planet) than to fighting a fire already raging.\n''Climate change presents a very real risk,'' said Carl Wunsch, a climate and oceans expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It seems worth a very large premium to insure ourselves against the most catastrophic scenarios. Denying the risk seems utterly stupid. Claiming we can calculate the probabilities with any degree of skill seems equally stupid.''\nMany in this camp seek a policy of reducing vulnerability to all climate extremes while building public support for a sustained shift to nonpolluting energy sources.\nThey have made their voices heard in Web logs, news media interviews and at least one statement from a large scientific group, the World Meteorological Organization. In early December, that group posted a statement written by a committee consisting of most of the climatologists assessing whether warming seas have affected hurricanes.\nWhile each degree of warming of tropical oceans is likely to intensify such storms a percentage point or two in the future, they said, there is no firm evidence of a heat-triggered strengthening in storms in recent years. The experts added that the recent increase in the impact of storms was because of more people getting in harm's way, not stronger storms.\nThere are enough experts holding such views that Roger A. Pielke Jr., a political scientist and blogger at the University of Colorado, Boulder, came up with a name for them (and himself): ''nonskeptical heretics.''\n''A lot of people have independently come to the same sort of conclusion,'' Dr. Pielke said. ''We do have a problem, we do need to act, but what actions are practical and pragmatic?''\nThis approach was most publicly laid out in an opinion article on the BBC Web site in November by Mike Hulme, the director of the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research in Britain.\nDr. Hulme said that shrill voices crying doom could paralyze instead of inspire.\n''I have found myself increasingly chastised by climate change campaigners when my public statements and lectures on climate change have not satisfied their thirst for environmental drama,'' he wrote. ''I believe climate change is real, must be faced and action taken. But the discourse of catastrophe is in danger of tipping society onto a negative, depressive and reactionary trajectory.''\nOther experts say there is no time for nuance, given the general lack of public response to the threat posed particularly by carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and forests that persists for a century or more in the air and is accumulating rapidly in the atmosphere and changing the pH of the oceans.\nJames E. Hansen, the veteran climate scientist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who has spoken out about climate dangers since 1988, has recently said that scientists have been too quiet too long.\n''If we want to avoid producing a different planet, we need to start acting now,'' and not with paltry steps, he said in a recent e-mail exchange with a reporter and other scientists. ''It seems almost to be a secret that we cannot put all of the fossil-fuel CO2 into the air without producing a different planet, and yes, dangerous change. There are people who don't know that!''\nDebate among scientists over how to describe the climate threat is particularly intense right now as experts work on the final language in portions of the latest assessment of global warming by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nIn three previous reports, the last published in 2001, this global network of scientists operating under the auspices of the United Nations has presented an ever-firmer picture of a growing human role in warming.\nStudies used to generate the next report (portions are to be issued in February) have shown a likely warming in the 21st century -- unless emissions of greenhouse gases abate -- at least several times that of the last century's one-degree rise.\nBut substantial uncertainty still clouds projections of important impacts, like how high and quickly seas would rise as ice sheets thawed.\nRecent drafts of the climate report used a conservative analysis that does not project a rise most people would equate with catastrophe, scientists involved in writing it say. Other experts say this may send too comforting a message.\nDr. Hulme insists that it is best not to gloss over uncertainties.\nIn fact, he and other experts say that uncertainty is one reason to act -- as a hedge against the prospect that problems could be much worse than projected.\nHis goal, Dr. Hulme said, is to raise public appreciation of the unprecedented scale and nature of the challenge.\n''Climate change is not a problem waiting for a solution (least of all a solution delivered and packaged by science), but a powerful idea that will transform the way we develop,'' he said in an e-mail message.\nDr. Hulme and others avoid sounding alarmist, but offer scant comfort to anyone who doubts that humans are contributing to warming or believes the matter can be deferred.\nThese experts see a clear need for the public to engage now, but not to panic. They worry that portrayals of the issue like that in ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' the documentary focused on the views of Mr. Gore, may push too hard.\nMany in this group also see a need to portray clearly that the response would require far more than switching to fluorescent light bulbs and to hybrid cars.\n''This is a mega-ethical challenge,'' said Jerry D. Mahlman, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who has studied global warming for more than three decades. ''In space, it's the size of a planet, and in time, it has scales far broader than what we go-go Homo sapiens are accustomed to dealing with.''\nDr. Mahlman and others say that the buildup of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases cannot be quickly reversed with existing technologies. And even if every engine on earth were shut down today, they add, there would be no measurable impact on the warming rate for many years, given the buildup of heat already banked in the seas.\nBecause of the scale and time lag, a better strategy, Dr. Mahlman and others say, is to treat human-caused warming more as a risk to be reduced than a problem to be solved.\nThese experts also say efforts to attribute recent weather extremes to the climate trend, though they may generate headlines in the short run, distract from the real reasons to act, which relate more to the long-term relationship of people and the planet.\n''Global warming is real, it's serious, but it's just one of many global challenges that we're facing,'' said John M. Wallace, a climatologist at the University of Washington. ''I portray it as part of a broader problem of environmental stewardship -- preserving a livable planet with abundant resources for future generations.''\nSome experts, though, argue that moderation in a message is likely to be misread as satisfaction with the pace of change.\nJohn P. Holdren, an energy and environment expert at Harvard and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, defended the more strident calls for limits on carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases.\n''I am one of those who believes that any reasonably comprehensive and up-to-date look at the evidence makes clear that civilization has already generated dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system,'' Dr. Holdren said. ''What keeps me going is my belief that there is still a chance of avoiding catastrophe.''\nArticles in this series are examining the ways in which the world is, and is not, moving toward a more energy-efficient, environmentally benign future.

1815809	Restored Tiles In the Heart Of Central Park	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05EED81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Bethesda Terrace is being restored to the vision of Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted. They designed it as a split-level terrace overlooking the park's lake, with an underground arcade whose ceiling was composed of almost 16,000 tiles. Over the decades, the 50-ton ceiling weakened and its tiles deteriorated. The tiles have been in storage since being removed in the 1980s during an initial repair effort. The Central Park Conservancy renewed its plan for a $7 million restoration after getting a $3.5 million gift from the estate of Evelyn West in 2002. The arcade, originally completed in the 1860s, is expected to reopen in late January.\nHAEYOUN PARK AND GRAHAM ROBERTS\nTile Restoration\nCLEANING AND REPAIRING Conservators have spent the last two years cleaning all 15,876 tiles, reattaching broken segments and repainting the tiles to match their original colors.\nREPLACING DAMAGE About 10 percent of the tiles were beyond repair. New ones were made in Stokeon-Trent, England, for $250 to $270 each.\nREINSTALLING TILE PANELS The 49 panels alternate between two patterns. Three panels, consisting only of brand new tiles, will be placed in one of the two side loggias.\nNew Layers Of Support\nUPPER TERRACE A new waterproof membrane will catch water leaking through the pavement and redirect it to a subsurface drain before it reaches the ceiling tiles.\nSTEEL SUPPORTS Brick arches have been replaced by steel beams, which, together with the existing wrought iron girders, will act as the primary support for the road above.\nCAST IRON RIBS The ornamental cast iron framework was painted a shade of gold with mica powder for extra sheen, accented by blue and reddish brown. Not much is known about the framework's historic colors other than that they were ''richly gilded.''\nTILE PANELS Tiles on each panel are fused with mortar, then screwed into a metal frame so they can be installed into the cast iron ribs as a single unit.\nEach panel has 324 encaustic, or inlaid, tiles. They were made using small pieces of colored clay laid into a mold and baked together so that the colors are embedded, not just a surface glaze.\nDiagrams highlight the aforementioned items.\n(Aerial photograph by Sanborn via Google Earth; The New York Times)\n(Sources by Central Park Conservancy; Conservation Solutions Inc.)
1815810	Thousands Honor Ford Under the Capitol Dome	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407EED81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Thousands of mourners filed past the coffin of former President Gerald R. Ford on Sunday as he lay in state below the Capitol dome, many saying they came to pay overdue respect to an overshadowed leader.\n''We owe him a debt of gratitude, and we never really expressed it,'' said Tim Fain, a consultant for I.B.M. who lives a few blocks away from the Capitol.\n''He didn't ask to be president,'' Mr. Fain said. ''He didn't have an agenda. He was a good man, an honorable man, who was asked to do a horrible job, through no fault of his own, and came through and brought the country back together.''\nMr. Ford's memorial did not bring out the kind of crowds or emotions that President Ronald Reagan's did two years ago, when the round-the-clock viewing attracted tens of thousands who waited in line for five hours or more. The wait to see Mr. Ford's coffin was seldom longer than an hour.\nIndeed, many in the crowd said they came as much to honor the office of president as the man who had occupied it for two and a half tumultuous years in the 1970s. More people talked about Watergate, Vietnam and inflation than about Mr. Ford's words or deeds. Mourners gawked at the Capitol's art and architecture as guards guided them in and out. Almost everyone interviewed said they happened to be in town or lived nearby.\n''Not a lot of presidents are going to be dying in the near future,'' said Frank Lopes, an advertising executive from Asbury, N.J. ''It is an opportunity to see how the respect is paid.''\nMarissa Hyde brought her young daughter from the Virginia suburbs because, Ms. Hyde said, ''This is a history-making event, and it is not every day that we live in the nation's capital and can see something like this.''\nFiling out of the rotunda, where Mr. Ford's coffin lay on the bier once used for Lincoln and under the painting of ''The Apotheosis of Washington'' in the eye of the dome, some said they were surprised by a wave of feelings for Mr. Ford. Ms. Hyde, for one, left choking back tears.\nR. J. Konkoleski, a hospice worker from Adena, Ohio, who was born in 1977, the year Mr. Ford left office, said, ''It was a lot more moving than I even anticipated.'' Mr. Konkoleski said he happened to be visiting friends on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and came to the Capitol out of a sense of patriotic duty. But he left marveling at the chain of circumstances that elevated Mr. Ford to lead the most powerful nation in the world, saying, ''Would he have made it if all the 'ifs' weren't there?''\nJoanne Richcreek, who said she had arrived from Fairfax, Va., before 7 a.m., said she came partly because of a first-hand experience with Mr. Ford. While she was still working for the government, Ms. Richcreek said, she once had to call the Michigan office that he maintained after leaving the presidency, expecting to talk to a secretary. ''A guy got on the phone and said, 'This is Jerry. Who is this?' '' she recalled. ''He was very friendly, so there was this personal connection.''\nTwo of the former president's sons, Jack and Steve, spent time Sunday afternoon shaking hands with visitors before they filed past the coffin, thanking each one on behalf of the family. Former Senator Bob Dole, Mr. Ford's running mate in 1976, came to pay his respects and appeared surprised to see Jack Ford.\nAlthough few said they had traveled long distances to be there, Charles Pruett, an administrator at Georgetown University, postponed a trip to Los Angeles for New Year's Eve.\n''He was a very good and decent man who was called at the right time to serve the country when we needed it most,'' Mr. Pruett said. ''We were very fortunate, and I felt that if I could do anything to at least show a little respect I was going to do so.''
1815811	Wisconsin City's Revival of Downtown Has a Downside	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06EED81630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	This college town received what it wanted when, during the 1980s and 90s, it sought to reverse the decline of its downtown and to create a more vibrant civic center that would draw people at night and on weekends.\nSince then, thousands of young professionals, retirees and former suburbanites have moved to glistening condominium buildings in the shadow of the state Capitol's dome and only a few blocks from the University of Wisconsin's main campus. And there is hardly a bad night for business near State Street, where university students and tourists pack restaurants and bars to capacity even on freezing weeknights.\nBut as downtown's population and revelry have grown, so have overcrowding on the streets, vandalism and, most significantly, the police say, alcohol-related crime. Mayor Dave Cieslewicz and other officials find themselves grappling with a problem that is a direct result of Madison's successful transformation: how to tone down downtown.\nAs an urban issue, the downsizing of downtowns has little precedent because many cities, particularly in the Midwest, are struggling mightily to bring people back to their cores, not send them away.\nOf course, many college towns deal with problems related to drinking. In the Midwest alone, La Crosse, Wis., and East Lansing and Ann Arbor, Mich., are struggling with how to cope with the public mayhem often fueled by inebriated students.\nIn Madison, two Common Council members, convinced that much of what ails downtown can be traced to the proliferation of bars and restaurants known more for drinking than dining, introduced a plan intended to reduce the number of such establishments, and to restrict the approval of new liquor licenses.\nThe plan, which has the support of Mayor Cieslewicz (pronounced chess-LEV-ich), is preliminary and does not detail, for example, how many or which places may be closed. A final plan is expected to be ready for a Council vote in the spring.\nThat area of nearly one square mile -- between Lake Mendota, Lake Monona and Blair and Lake Streets -- has 120 places that serve only or mostly alcohol. They have a capacity of more than 11,000 people, city officials said.\nThe proposal has its critics, many of whom call it nothing less than modern-day Prohibition, and an assault on personal freedom and the free market that flies in the face of Madison's traditional liberalism and Wisconsin's entrenched drinking culture.\nSome Council members say they worry that limiting the number of bars will only increase the number of drinkers who turn to house parties and makeshift taverns, where binge drinking and bad behavior often go together but behind closed doors.\n''A lot of the activists on this issue revile alcohol, and their logic is equally fallacious as the original Prohibitionists','' said Austin King, the president of the Common Council and a member of its Progressive caucus. ''From a safety perspective,'' Mr. King said, ''I would much, much rather have young people drinking in the regulated environment of bars.''\nCollege students, not surprisingly, also oppose the plan. ''A proportion of students drink irresponsibly, but the majority don't,'' said Katrina Schleitwiler, 21, a political science major at the University of Wisconsin. ''This would just drive students into other places to drink and not affect the problem at all.''\nAlthough Ms. Schleitwiler acknowledged a spate of crimes around campus and downtown, she said she did not think alcohol abuse by students or anyone else was at its root. ''Madison is becoming a big city with more crime,'' she said. ''How different is that from any other city?''\nThe police see things differently. According to a recent police department analysis of attacks in which someone was injured downtown, about 75 percent of the victims and perpetrators were intoxicated. The analysis also found that after midnight on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, police officers, paramedics and firefighters often spent half to all of their working hours responding to alcohol-fueled fights and disorderly conduct. Noise, public urination and vandalism are constant concerns.\nThe University of Wisconsin has tried many initiatives to curtail under-age drinking and older students' overconsumption. Most recently, the city and the college jointly paid for a municipal alcohol policy coordinator -- referred to as the ''bar czar'' -- to redouble those efforts. ''Frankly, nothing has worked very well, and there's still a culture of binge drinking,'' Mayor Cieslewicz said.\nFor the last five years, Madison, formerly a sleepy college town, has grown by about 2,500 people a year into a medium-size city with a population of about 230,000. In the last decade, 1,950 apartments -- rental and condominium units -- have been built downtown.\nBut the arrival of so many newcomers has produced a culture clash.\nStefanie Moritz, a retired librarian, moved with her husband from Phoenix into a downtown condominium about three years ago, drawn by pedestrian-friendly streets, a university job for her husband and the community's progressive politics.\n''We decided that we definitely wanted to live downtown, so we could get rid of one of our cars, my husband could walk to work and we could enjoy the downtown experience,'' Ms. Moritz said. ''The reality is a little bit different.''\nShe said she quickly grew irritated at being awakened at 2:30 a.m., when the noisy bar crowd usually begins to make its way home, dropping empty beer cans and other trash along the way. One morning she woke to find that garbage had been torched and the flames had charred a tree.\n''I want to live downtown, but I also want a decent quality of life,'' Ms. Moritz said. ''And I feel that that is being denied by the present level of alcohol use.''\nAbout 18 months ago, Ms. Moritz became active in a relatively new residents' group, Capitol Neighborhoods, which is at the forefront of the push for stricter drinking rules.\nHawk Schenkel, the owner of one of the biggest restaurants on State Street, Hawk's Bar and Grill, pointed out that residents who criticized the downtown scene had ''moved downtown in a university town.''\n''Do they know where all the revenue comes from downtown, why we have a downtown that's alive and worth being in?'' Mr. Schenkel asked. ''All that could change.''\n''If the ordinance as written were to pass, my bar would automatically be worth at least $100,000 more, overnight, and it's clear that I personally stand to gain financially,'' he said. ''But I'm against this on principle, and I don't think it helps the problem. My argument is that there aren't enough bars. It's the overcrowding that leads to violence.''

1815814	What Did Hussein's Execution Accomplish?	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E6D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	To the Editor:\nRe ''Saddam Hussein Hanged in Baghdad; Swift End to Drama; Troops on Alert'' (front page, Dec. 30):\nAs hard as it is to mourn Saddam Hussein, his hurried execution raises a number of disquieting questions.\nWas the trial fair?\nThe statements of President Bush on the subject are hardly reassuring, as they come from a man who supports detention without due process and who considers torture a legitimate interrogation method.\nWhat will the repercussions of this execution worldwide be? Will it encourage the most brutal dictators of the world to hang on to their power by all means to avoid certain execution once they are deposed?\nMore generally, does revenge through the death penalty bring closure, or does it elicit more revenge and more violence, initiating a spiral of hatred that no human force may be able to stop?\nI am afraid that the execution of Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with justice and was carried out only to satisfy the hatred he inspired in most of us.\nThis is a lame excuse to take any life, including Saddam Hussein's.\nLodovico Balducci Tampa, Fla., Dec. 30, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nJustice in a show trial conducted by conquerors is a joke.\nAnd even assuming that Saddam Hussein was guilty of the crimes laid at his door, the cost of putting him to death is unacceptably high, since it adds to our sorry image in the Middle East as violent, self-serving intruders.\nMary R. Holbrow Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 30, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nRe ''Saddam Hussein, Defiant Dictator Who Ruled Iraq With Violence and Fear'' (obituary, Dec. 30):\nYou write, ''The despot, known as Saddam, had oppressed Iraq for more than 30 years, unleashing devastating regional wars and reducing his once promising, oil-rich nation to a claustrophobic police state.''\nThis simple statement illustrates why the invasion of Iraq and the complete elimination of Saddam Hussein and his regime was necessary, regardless of the Bush administration's ''true'' motivation for the invasion or its incompetence in controlling the situation and in providing aid and security to the people of Iraq.\nNo self-respecting humanitarian should raise his head if he opposed the war knowing what Saddam Hussein was responsible for. And what he would surely be doing today if still in power regardless of all the sanctions, diplomacy and United Nations debates.\nEddie Brown New York, Dec. 30, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nWhat a terrible way to start a new year. The United States has confirmed that it has lost any authority to lecture a nation or individual on moral or human rights issues.\nKeith Nolan Carrick-on-Shannon, Ireland Dec. 30, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nWhile I agree with all you say about Saddam Hussein's crimes (''The Rush to Hang Saddam Hussein,'' editorial, Dec. 29), you do not mention that the United States government supported him throughout his murderous career until he invaded Kuwait in 1990.\nSurely this is important for us to acknowledge, even study.\nAlan Meyers Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 30, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nIt was interesting to read your ''terrible swiftness'' description of Saddam Hussein's hanging death (front page, Dec. 30).\nGiven his three years of trials and imprisonment, Mr. Hussein was given a lot more time than the tens of thousands he killed in Iraq.\nJohn Goodman Tuckahoe, N.Y., Dec. 30, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nNow that Saddam Hussein has been put to death, why can't President Bush declare victory and bring the troops home? After all, was not removing Saddam Hussein one of the stated objects in invading Iraq?\nEllen Wiest Palm Springs, Calif., Dec. 30, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nSaddam Hussein may have deserved it, but we didn't.\nBy we, I mean the American people, who were forced into being accomplices in the show trial and barbaric execution of Saddam Hussein.\nMost civilized countries denounced this execution, and even Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain had voiced misgivings.\nPaul E. Harmeier Darien, Conn., Dec. 30, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nSaddam Hussein has finally received his reward for crimes committed as a dictator, and all it has cost the United States (so far) is nearly 3,000 military deaths, tens of thousands of Americans wounded, hundreds of billions of dollars and international credibility.\nThis tally, when added to the staggering Iraqi death toll from collateral damage and sectarian violence, might provoke a reasonable person to ask whether there is a price that is too high to pay for planting a seed of democracy in a very resistant soil.\nBuck Rutledge Knoxville, Tenn., Dec. 30, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nAs a person who strongly objects to the death penalty, I cannot understand why we were subjected to the vivid portrayal of the hanging of Saddam Hussein.\nI feel for the young people who saw such images in their fresh and untainted minds. This execution by hanging reminiscent of the Middle Ages is not helping them consider other kinds of punishment.\nWhat do we say to young people: ''Saddam Hussein killed a lot of people in his country so we're punishing him by hanging''? Don't we stoop to the level of the criminals when we want retribution?\nLife is God's creation; so with death. It's not for men to do.\nPriscilla V. Dizon Seattle, Dec. 30, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nThe hanging of Saddam Hussein is a watershed in modern Arab history and Arab-American relations.\nTwo things about it will be remembered by all:\nIt would have been impossible without the American invasion, conquest and occupation of Iraq; and it was achieved by and through the following chain of events:\nSaddam Hussein's being captured and held by American occupation forces; being tried by a court of controversial, if not dubious, legitimacy appointed and approved by the American authorities; and being executed by American encouragement, prodding and certain approval.\nThe act and the events that eventually led to the execution were undertaken and met with the approval of the majority of Arab officialdom and the rejection and disapproval of the majority of Arab public and popular opinion.\nAnother landmark event in Arab-American relations.\nOmar I.

1815816	Giants Get Fresh Start but Face Whole New Round of Questions	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E6D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Only 24 hours earlier, it seemed that Giants Coach Tom Coughlin could be fired by the time dawn broke on a new year. But on Sunday, as the early results from the day's N.F.L. schedule were confirming the Giants' place in the playoffs, Coughlin was on the telephone, cheerfully talking like the leader of a team reborn.\nThe Giants beat the Washington Redskins, 34-28, on Saturday night. It was their second victory in the season's final eight games, and it proved just enough for them to slip into the postseason as a wild-card team.\n''We're all excited about having this opportunity,'' Coughlin said during a conference call. ''And we've certainly got to have great energy and great focus and prepare to play a team that's really a hot team.''\nThat team, Coughlin had just learned, is the rival Philadelphia Eagles, who won their final five games to finish 10-6, atop the National Football Conference East.\nThe Giants -- 8-8 in the regular-season standings, 0-0 in their minds -- will face the Eagles in Philadelphia on Sunday at 4:30 p.m.\nThe Giants beat the Eagles there in the second game of the season, erasing a 24-7 fourth-quarter deficit for a 30-24 victory in overtime. The Eagles won the Dec. 17 rematch at Giants Stadium, 36-22, by scoring two touchdowns in 10 seconds -- a scoring pass followed by an interception return in the fourth quarter.\nIf the Giants are to realize the Super Bowl hopes they held so firmly at the beginning of the season, and that felt completely implausible before the weekend, they will have to win three games on the road -- first in Philadelphia, then in Chicago, then in New Orleans, Seattle or Dallas.\nIt is not wholly unreasonable. The Giants were 5-3 on the road this season, 3-5 at home. And last year, the Pittsburgh Steelers became the first N.F.L. team to win three playoff games on the road on their way to a Super Bowl championship.\n''I'm always looking for examples that can be called upon that make specific points, and certainly that's a very good one,'' Coughlin said.\nThe Carolina Panthers were seeded sixth in the N.F.C. last season and beat the Giants and Bears on the road before falling in Seattle in the conference championship.\nA swirling mystery surrounding the Giants is how many more victories, if any, are required to guarantee Coughlin's return for the final season of his four-year contract. The Giants' owners have made no public comments about his job security.\nBut the Giants have made the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1989 and 1990, a strong argument for Coughlin's return. The coach would not say whether he has received any assurances or warnings from his employers.\n''I'm not talking about anything that has to do with that,'' Coughlin said Sunday. ''I've not even thought one thought about that. I've only been focused on trying to find a way for us to win, and that's the way I will continue to focus.''\nWinning only one playoff game will probably require a better performance than the one that the Giants mustered against the beleaguered Redskins, who ended the season with a 5-11 record. If the Giants are to wind their way through the N.F.C. bracket, they will have to get steadier play from quarterback Eli Manning and a stouter effort from their low-ranked and inconsistent defense.\nManning was 12 of 26 for 101 yards against the Redskins, and his longest completion was 14 yards. Coughlin was complimentary of Manning's game management -- changing pass plays to runs and vice versa, recognizing blitzes and not throwing any interceptions. But he acknowledged his concern over the number of incomplete passes, a constant issue for Manning, who is in his third season.\n''Certainly we'd like to have a higher percentage,'' Coughlin said.\nThe Giants beat the Redskins largely on a few bursts by running back Tiki Barber. In the final regular-season game of his career, the retiring Barber saved his best for last -- a career-high, franchise-record 234 yards rushing, with touchdown runs of 15, 55 and 50 yards.\nThat probably will be the strategy of the play caller, Kevin Gilbride, against the Eagles -- piling as much of the load on Barber as possible and as little on Manning as is reasonable.\nThe Giants will also spend the week searching for Band-Aids for a struggling defense. Handed a 27-7 third-quarter lead, the Giants allowed three long touchdown drives -- each lasting at least eight plays and going 69, 66 and 68 yards.\nAn inconsistent quarterback and a softening defense were key factors in the Giants' fall through the standings in November and December, when a two-game lead in the division became a by-the-fingernails entry into the playoffs.\nIt certainly beats the alternative. At kickoff of the Redskins game, it took an optimist wearing glasses tinted in Giants blue to envision a championship run. A few hours later, the team had its record set back to 0-0, same as every other contender. A new year has dawned.\nEXTRA POINTS\nThe offensive coordinator John Hufnagel, stripped of his duties last week and assigned a minor administrative role, has left the team. ''We worked together last week, and then John felt it was best for him to move on,'' Tom Coughlin said. Kevin Gilbride, the quarterbacks coach, took over Hufnagel's responsibilities. Coughlin said he was not sure if tight end Jeremy Shockey, who missed Saturday's game with a sprained ankle, would play against the Eagles. Roy E. Posner, a financial advisor for the Giants and a former chief financial officer of the Loews Corp., died after a heart attack about 90 minutes after the game. Posner was 73.\nPRO FOOTBALL
1815817	Gumbel's Studio Skills Are Lost in Transition To NFL Network Booth	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E6D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The plan to turn Bryant Gumbel into a play-by-play announcer for the NFL Network was always a risky wager that at age 58, he could adapt his broadcasting skills from the studio to the booth without prior experience.\nBy the evidence of his eighth and final game of the season, the Giants' 34-28 victory over the Redskins on Saturday night, Gumbel has shown how difficult mastering play-by-play is. Or he has made it seem tougher than it is.\nGumbel's hiring was a surprise, but he is a big name and all the best play-by-play voices were under contract. Choosing Cris Collinsworth as the analyst was an easy choice; he is fearless, blunt, amusing and self-deprecating and has worked well with various partners. Experience helps, and he has had to dominate the games to buttress Gumbel's weaknesses.\nI thought Gumbel would be better than he has been. Maybe it was the faith that he would be able to adapt more adroitly than he has. You can harp on the thinness of his voice, but that's a minor element of his struggles.\nHe is far from mastering the job's mechanics, although he's a little better than he was a few weeks ago. But he still doesn't identify players, see penalty flags or describe action with requisite speed and detail.\nHe does not seem to see what is happening as well as veteran announcers do, which can be attributed to inexperience or aging eyes.\nIn his call of a clearly incomplete pass in the first quarter, he gave us a call that sounded like a completion. ''Manning with time,'' he said. ''Tim Carter. Close to the marker. Ade Jimoh.'' Collinsworth, too polite to correct the miscall, simply paused before he criticized Carter for the dropped ball.\nIn the third quarter, on a pass that seemed to have been scooped by Carter, Gumbel said: ''Manning throws, this time to Tim Carter.''\nWas it incomplete or not? Gumbel didn't say.\nIn separate but identical circumstances, Gumbel showed a startling lack of knowledge about elementary football.\nLate in the third quarter, Eli Manning completed a 10-yard pass to David Tyree, but it was not enough for a Giants first down on third-and-17.\nGumbel said: ''Complete to David Tyree, but he's going to be short of the first-down marker and the Giants are going to give it up on downs.''\nOut came Jeff Feagles, who punted the ball 42 yards on fourth down.\nGumbel did not correct himself.\nNor did Collinsworth.\nIt is football 101 that when one team surrenders the ball on downs, after an unsuccessful fourth-down play, the other starts at the yard line where the previous series ended.\nBut with 2 minutes 26 seconds left in the fourth quarter, Gumbel displayed the hole in his knowledge again when Tiki Barber ran for 7 yards on third-and-10.\nGumbel said: ''He's going to be short of a first down and the Redskins will take over on downs,''\nAnd out came Feagles again to punt.\nAnd Gumbel did not correct himself.\nIf his producer, Mark Loomis, tried to help, we don't know.\nIn moments when he converses, debates or jokes with Collinsworth, Gumbel is comfortable; these exchanges mirror his studio experiences.\nBut on the type of plays during which Al Michaels, Jim Nantz, Joe Buck and Mike Tirico raise their voices and provide exciting and detailed calls, Gumbel doesn't.\nOn Barber's first touchdown run Saturday night, Gumbel and Collinsworth were mired in a conversation about the Redskins' lack of takeaways this season; Barber had been knocked over and was on his feet before Gumbel caught up to the play.\nGumbel's call of Barber's second rushing score, of 55 yards, was passable, but his description of Barber's final touchdown run, a 50-yarder, was rendered this way: ''First down, Giants. Barber.''\nHe broke for four seconds of silence, without noting the yard lines Barber was passing, the Redskins he was outrunning or the defenders who missed tackling him.\nThen he resumed the call: ''Touchdown, Giants.''\nAfterward, he fell silent for a few more seconds, then offered some of the details he should have given during the immediate, live call. The task, though, is to be quiet -- or ''lay out'' -- after a touchdown, not during it.\nGumbel has shown at the highest level that his career shift -- from what he has called semi-retirement -- was more difficult than he could have imagined.\nHe has 11 months until his next broadcast to prove that he can be better than the play-by-play announcers who are ranked lowest on Fox's or CBS's depth charts.\nTV SPORTS E-mail: sportsbiz@nytimes.com
1815818	One Team Thrives on Chemistry; Another Survives Without It	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE6D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	For the Jets and the Giants, today is a rare happy New Year: It is only the fifth time the two New York pro football franchises have been together in the Super Bowl tournament.\nThat's together in a Sunday doubleheader, but not in momentum, with the Jets soaring into New England for a 1 p.m. game and the Giants stumbling into Philadelphia at 4:30 p.m.\nThe Jets (10-6) won five of their past six games, including yesterday's 23-3 domination of the Raiders.\nThe Giants, with Tiki Barber slashing for 234 rushing yards and 3 touchdowns in Saturday night's 34-28 triumph against the Redskins, squeezed into the playoffs with an 8-8 record after losing six of their previous seven games.\nTo listen to quarterback Chad Pennington's synopsis of the Jets' success, it would seem that the teams are not together in another important area.\n''It's about the players believing in the coach, and the coaches believing in the players,'' Pennington said.\nThe way the Jets finished their relatively easy schedule, they surely believe in Coach Eric Mangini, who finally used the word playoffs in a sentence after his Gatorade shower, and he believes in them. But the way the Giants had to depend on Barber to outscore the Redskins, a 5-11 disappointment, it's difficult to know if they believe in Coach Tom Coughlin and his staff, and if Coughlin believes in his injury-depleted roster.\nAn 8-8 record is not necessarily a quick lose-and-out for a wild card. In the years since the 16-game schedule began in 1978, six other 8-8 teams reached the playoffs via the wild card and two of them won an opening-round game on the road before losing in the divisional round.\nTwo years ago, the Vikings and the Rams were 8-8 in gaining the National Football Conference playoffs. The Vikings upset the Packers, 31-17, before losing to the Eagles, 27-14; and the Rams stunned the Seahawks, 27-20, before losing to the Falcons, 47-17.\nThe four 8-8 wild-card teams that lost in the opening round included the 1991 Jets, who fell in Houston, 17-10, after sneaking into the playoffs with an overtime victory in Miami, as well as the 1999 Cowboys, the 1999 Lions and the 1990 Saints.\nThe 1985 Browns won their division with an 8-8 record and lost to the Dolphins in their first playoff game.\nIn a third coaching chess match between Mangini and his mentor, Bill Belichick, the Jets would seem to have a puncher's chance against the Patriots, whom they defeated, 17-14, in Foxborough after an early season 24-17 loss at Giants Stadium. But it won't be easy for Pennington to win a passing duel with Tom Brady, a three-time Super Bowl winner. The Giants don't seem to have the manpower (and maybe the will power) to upset the Eagles, especially in Philadelphia.\nThe Giants split with the Eagles, winning by 30-24 in overtime in Philadelphia on Eli Manning's three touchdown passes, but losing, 36-22, at Giants Stadium a little more than two weeks ago.\nAgainst the Redskins on Saturday night, Barber had the best game any Giants running back ever had, especially when a victory meant so much not only to him as the last regular-season game of his career before he disappears into a television studio, but also to the salvation of a season that loomed as a disaster.\nFor all the wonderful games played by the Giants' Hall of Fame running backs -- Frank Gifford, Tuffy Leemans and Ken Strong -- and by Joe Morris and Rodney Hampton, none of those stars carried the Giants the way Barber did at FedEx Field, across the Potomac River from Virginia, where he grew up as a Redskins fan.\nBut against the Eagles in what could be his last game, Barber will be running against one of the N.F.L.'s toughest defenses. There won't be many holes for him to dart through, and the Eagles' demon safety, Brian Dawkins, won't be as easy to outrun as the Redskins.\nThe Jets not only survived, but thrived without their future Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin, the fourth-leading career rusher in pro football with more 14,000 yards. Martin was never activated after having knee surgery late last season -- another tribute to Mangini's day-to-day mantra for his players: Try to win the next game and try to make progress.\n''We haven't had the time to doubt ourselves and to ask, what if?'' Pennington said, alluding to Martin. ''It's been full go since Day 1. Our young guys who haven't had opportunities before but had them now have stepped to the forefront. Each week, somebody you may not have heard from stepped up and made the play. That's what football is all about.''\nIn Martin's absence, the rookie Leon Washington, a fourth-round selection with the draft choice awarded to the Jets when the Chiefs hired Herman Edwards as their coach, rushed for 650 yards. Cedric Houston had 374 and Kevan Barlow 370.\nThat adds up to 1,394 yards, about what a healthy Martin might have had. But a yard is a yard is a yard, no matter who gets it. So the Jets, riding Pennington's cool comeback from his second rotator-cuff operation, are soaring into the playoffs as the Giants stumble in. And for only the fifth time, they're both there.\nSPORTS OF THE TIMES
1815819	Pain Is Real; Coles's Role Is as a Decoy	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Laveranues Coles's face brightened when somebody mentioned the block he made to help spring running back Leon Washington on his 15-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter of the Jets' 23-3 victory against the Oakland Raiders.\n''I think that explains me totally,'' Coles said. ''I can go out and make all the catches in the world, but I think the most important things I do are the little things. I take more pride in blocking and watching other guys score and stuff like that than anything.''\nQuarterback Chad Pennington threw to Coles twice unsuccessfully in the end zone, but on Sunday he was mostly used as a decoy, drawing double-teams to open the field for Jerricho Cotchery, who had 7 catches for 53 yards, and Justin McCareins, who caught 5 passes for 27 yards.\nColes had two catches to finish the regular season with a career-high 91, one more than he had in 2004 with the Washington Redskins. It was by design that Coles did not run many routes across the middle; the game plan was to keep him out of harm's way as much as possible. He was playing six days after sustaining a concussion in a helmet-to-helmet hit in the second quarter of the Jets' 13-10 victory at Miami.\nColes played the second half against the Dolphins but did not practice all week.\n''He's pretty banged up right now,'' Cotchery said. ''He's a warrior. To see him take the hit he took last week when he didn't know where he was at and come back to play today is amazing to me.''\nJets Coach Eric Mangini does not talk about injuries and has made it clear that he expects his players to follow his lead. Coles was asked repeatedly about the state of his health after the game and, per Mangini's edict, refused to comment.\n''Ask me about the playoffs,'' he said.\nOne reporter's persistent questioning about Coles's head injury led to a shouting match between the two that ended with two Jets employees stepping in to restrain them.\n''I'm sorry you had to see that,'' Coles said after cooling down.\nColes's toughness continues to impress Mangini, who said: ''He's different than other guys who say, 'I'm O.K. but. ' He says, 'I'm O.K.' He's so tough he doesn't give you anything.''\nPRO FOOTBALL
1815820	In Starting Role, Barrett Sets Positive Tone Early	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E5D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Cornerback David Barrett typifies the mind-set Jets Coach Eric Mangini tried to instill during his first year as a head coach. He does not pout about playing time, knowing that his time to contribute will eventually come.\nIn the first quarter of the Jets' 23-3 victory Sunday against the Raiders, Barrett helped give the Jets the momentum when he caused Raiders receiver Johnnie Morant to fumble after he caught a pass at the Oakland 47. Cornerback Hank Poteat recovered and gave the Jets the ball on the Oakland 44.\nEight plays later, Chad Pennington hit tight end Chris Baker for a 1-yard touchdown pass and a 7-0 lead for the Jets.\nThe Jets did not relinquish the lead.\nBarrett had been thrust into the starting lineup after cornerback Andre Dyson injured his right knee last week and was inactive Sunday. Barrett started every game for the Jets in 2004, the last time they made the playoffs. Last season, though, a poke in the eye resulted in a burst blood vessel, and he was limited to starting in eight games. He has been bothered by a hip injury this season, and Sunday was only his third start.\nStanding in the middle of the Jets' raucous locker room after the game, Barrett said he simply tried to be prepared ''whenever it is your turn to be ready.''\nThe Raiders' offense scored the fewest points of any team in the league this season, and the Jets' ability to score early increased the pressure on Oakland quarterback Aaron Brooks and running back Justin Fargas. Brooks was 15 of 26 for 136 yards and Fargas ran for 79 yards on 17 attempts. The Raiders' only score came on a 35-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski in the second quarter.\n''We were set up nicely by Dave's play,'' Baker said of Barrett's forced fumble. ''That turnover was pretty big for us to get up early on them.''\nThe expectations were not high for the Jets coming into the season, but behind a defense that has allowed 18.4 points a game this season and a balanced offense from Pennington and the rookie running back Leon Washington, the Jets (10-6) are in the playoffs as a wild card and will visit the New England Patriots (12-4) on Sunday.
1815821	With Wild-Card Spot Clinched, Jets Can Finally Talk Playoffs	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E5D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Jets' offense was on the field Sunday running out the clock on the regular season when the Jets' defense ran its own two-minute drill.\nCorwin Brown, the Jets' defensive backs coach, sidled over to Eric Mangini, the first-year head coach, on the sideline at the Meadowlands and asked him a series of questions that Mangini later said were nonsensical.\nWhile Brown distracted the usually hyperfocused Mangini, safety Kerry Rhodes and linebackers Eric Barton and Jonathan Vilma grabbed a cooler of Gatorade and surreptitiously assumed their positions according to plan.\nVilma stood behind Mangini, and Barton and Rhodes flanked him. Using a soft count, they lifted the cooler over Mangini's head and poured the contents on him. The celebration of the Jets' 23-3 victory against the Oakland Raiders, which secured the fifth seeding in the American Football Conference playoffs, had unofficially commenced.\nThe Jets (10-6) will meet the New England Patriots (12-4) on Sunday in Foxborough, Mass. They are 1-1 this season against the Patriots, the team Mangini left for the Jets.\n''It is exciting,'' Mangini said, ''because it has been a long road for us.''\nHe added: ''I am proud of them. I am really happy for us, collectively.''\nThe Jets' locker room, which had been a gloomy place three Sundays earlier after the Jets' 31-13 loss to the Buffalo Bills, was a much different place Sunday afternoon. Players were giddily saying -- or in the case of Rhodes, shouting -- the word they had been forbidden to speak for 17 weeks: Playoffs.\n''Now we can definitely say it, there is no more holding back from it,'' said tight end Chris Baker, whose 1-yard touchdown catch with 4 minutes 54 seconds left in the first quarter, on quarterback Chad Pennington's first pass attempt, gave the Jets all the scoring they needed.\nPennington completed 22 of 30 passes for 157 yards, but it was what he did not do that ultimately made the difference. He did not turn the ball over, he did not force the ball into coverage, he did not try to heave the ball downfield just to prove his critics wrong.\nAs he has all season, Pennington managed the offense with the daring of somebody who invests only in gold. From his short passes to the hip-length tan winter coat he slipped on after the game, Pennington proved in myriad ways that he was all about being practical, not peacocky.\nPennington took a sack from the Raiders' ageless Warren Sapp on the Jets' first drive rather than risk throwing an interception deep in his own territory. He threw to Laveranues Coles in the end zone twice unsuccessfully, the better to stretch the Raiders' defense, but was perfectly content to set up place-kicker Mike Nugent.\nNugent responded with field goals of 35, 22 and 35 yards to extend his streak of successful attempts to 18.\n''Without Chad, we wouldn't be in this situation,'' Coles said, avoiding the P-word as if by habit. ''His leadership abilities and the way he manages the football team are incomparable.''\nHe added: ''People always have negative things to say about his arm strength. I'm just excited for him to get all the recognition and praise that he deserves.''\nColes changed out of his uniform into black jeans and a black T-shirt with a sequined appliqué of the Pink Panther. He completed the outfit with a pink dinner jacket. Pennington gave Coles's ensemble a once-over and smiled. ''That's my boy Coles for you; he'll surprise you at every moment,'' he said.\nSix days after he sustained a concussion in the Jets' 13-10 victory at Miami, Coles was not feeling quite right. He was not sent on many routes across the middle and he sat out most of the fourth quarter after serving mostly as a decoy.\nBy his mere presence on the field, Coles drew double-teams that created space for Jerricho Cotchery, who had seven catches, and Justin McCareins, who made five.\nIn the beginning, Coles was like a lot of Jets; he was not convinced that Mangini's demanding practices were the best strategy for success. Unlike most of his teammates, he was not afraid to let his skepticism show.\nFive months after those first grueling three-hour practices during training camp, Coles acknowledged that he could see the method behind Mangini's meanness. ''Coach's method was good,'' he said. ''He worked us to grind us down to the bone to make us come together.''\nThe Raiders are as undisciplined as the Jets are focused. They lead the league in turnovers and collect penalties as if they were badges of honor. The Jets capitalized repeatedly on their opponent's inattention to detail, forcing two lost fumbles and an interception.\nThe Jets saw on film that the Raiders' receivers ran carelessly with the ball. Cornerback David Barrett, who was starting in place of the injured Andre Dyson, exploited that tendency in the first quarter to set the tone for the game.\nOn a third-down play on the Raiders' second possession, quarterback Aaron Brooks found Johnnie Morant on a 7-yard pass that would have been good for a first down. Barrett wrapped up Morant and knocked the ball out of his hands.\nJets cornerback Hank Poteat recovered the fumble, setting up the Baker touchdown. After the teams traded field goals in the second quarter, the Jets took over in the third, running 18 offensive plays to the Raiders' 7. The seventh play was the back-breaker for the Raiders: Brooks ran a quarterback keeper on fourth-and-inches and was stopped just short of the first-down marker by defensive end Shaun Ellis.\nEllis, Barrett, Barton, Baker and Pennington are among 17 Jets who were on the 2004 team that finished 10-6. That team won a playoff game at San Diego before losing in the second round to Pittsburgh. They came into this season highly motivated to show that last year's 4-12 record was an aberration and not a reflection of their talent.\n''I think we all understand that Coach Edwards had successful years here,'' said Pennington, referring to Mangini's predecessor, Herman Edwards. He added, ''There are a thousand different ways to be successful in this league, but that doesn't matter if you don't believe, if you don't take it upon yourself to get the job done and be accountable for your teammates.''\nAfter genuinely surprising Mangini with his Gatorade shower, Barton said, ''Like the coaches, we had a game plan and we executed it.''\nMangini gave the Jets a game plan for making the playoffs, and they executed it. It is the simplest way to explain their sublime season.\nPRO FOOTBALL
1815822	The Lonely Newspaper Reader	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E5D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	In the house where I grew up, everybody ate breakfast at the same time. The younger ones would sit at the table elbowing one another for toast while my dad stood, drinking coffee and reading The Minneapolis Star Tribune.\nHe would mumble and curse at the headlines, check the sports and then tell us it was time to go. When my brother John became a teenager, he left the table and would eat his toast, leaning against the washing machine and reading the paper as well.\nThis, I thought, is what it means to be a grown-up. You eat your food standing up, and you read the newspaper. So I did the same thing when I turned 13. I still do.\nLast Wednesday morning at my house, one of my daughters back from college was staying at a friend's house in the city, no doubt getting alerts on her cellphone for new postings to her Facebook page. Her sister got up, skipped breakfast and checked the mail for her NetFlix movies. My wife left early before the papers even arrived to commute to her job in the city while listening to the iPod she got for Christmas.\nTrue enough, my 10-year-old gave me five minutes over a bowl of Cheerios, but then she went into the dining room and opened the laptop to surf the Disney Channel on broadband, leaving me standing in the kitchen with my four newspapers. A few of those included news about the sale of The Star Tribune, a newspaper that found itself in reduced circumstances and sold at a reduced price to a private equity group.\nI looked around me and realized I didn't really need to read the papers to know why.\nSure, the consolidation of department stores and the flight of classified ads to the Web hurt big metropolitan dailies like The Star Tribune. This summer's downturn in overall newspaper advertising landed hard on the paper, with ads off 6.1 percent in the last year from the year before.\nThe McClatchy Company, which bought the paper's parent company with a great deal of fanfare in 1998 for $1.2 billion, looked at those numbers -- and the fact that it had lost 26,000 or so daily readers since it bought the paper -- and decided to sell the paper for $530 million. The chain was equally bullish when it bought Knight Ridder for $4.5 billion last summer and then turned around and sold 12 of the papers, including another newspaper in the Twin Cities, The Pioneer Press in St. Paul.\nBut the sale of The Star Tribune came completely out of the blue, in part because, as the chain's biggest paper, it was viewed as a marquee property. The parties were able to keep it quiet in part because they all knew each other. The principals for the buyers, Avista Capital Partners, were once a part of a private equity arm of Credit Suisse, which represented McClatchy in the sale.\nMcClatchy's chief executive, Gary B. Pruitt, said that tax advantages of $160 million made it a good time to sell, partly to offset capital gains from the sale of the Knight Ridder papers. When the stealth auction for the paper ended and word of the sale came out the day after Christmas, Mr. Pruitt said, ''I don't feel good about the paper being sold.''\nMe either. The paper, around in one version or another since 1867, may not have knocked down a lot of Pulitzers, but with its vigorous political reporting and thoughtful cultural coverage, it has served as a center for civic life in Minneapolis and beyond. The Star Tribune was not a great paper, but then my first car, a very used '64 Ford Falcon, wasn't great either. I still have a great deal of affection for both.\nThere are two ways to look at the sale: the second-biggest newspaper operator in the country, with its stock dropping in the wake of the Knight Ridder deal, dumped a paper with near 20 percent profit margins in what looked like a fire sale because big papers are doomed. Or, more brightly, a private equity firm saw an opportunity for a savvy investor who could operate the property without the quarter-to-quarter franticness that comes with making Wall Street happy.\nIt is a cliché of the media business that the assets go up and down the elevator every day. In Minneapolis, many of those assets are pals from my days of working as a reporter and editor at a weekly there, so I wondered: Who would be controlling their professional destinies, bottom feeders or benefactors?\nPrivate equity owners are often viewed with suspicion, in part because they have limited investment horizons and tend to milk properties for cash flow, clean up the balance sheet and then flip the property to what is technically known as a ''greater fool.'' The sale of The Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News by McClatchy to a local group of investors has resulted, after a sharp downturn this summer, in a great deal of strife and talks of significant layoffs.\nI talked to OhSang Kwon, one of the partners in Avista Capital Partners. ''We don't want to rule out anything, but the idea that we bought this paper with a quick exit in mind or that we were going to cut our way to profitability is not correct,'' he said. ''I don't have the hubris to say that we have the answers -- we are new to the newspaper business -- but the old way was not working. Maybe it is time for a different approach.''\nMaybe it is. Tomorrow, The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones & Company, will hit my doorstep in a smaller size and with a different approach, pushing much of the so-called commoditized news -- the daily reports and incremental articles that everyone has -- to the Web and filling the physical paper with more analysis and deeper reporting. Google, which has been dining to some degree on ads diverted from newspapers, announced last week that it is expanding a program to sell newspaper advertising using its own auction approach.\nAs I sat at the kitchen table, I marveled at the low price of a newspaper that had once preoccupied the conversation around my dinner table. Then I looked at the four papers on the table and the empty chairs that surrounded them. Before my second cup of coffee, the rest of my household had already started the day in a way that had nothing to do with the paper artifacts in front of me. Maybe I was the greater fool.\nTHE MEDIA EQUATION
1815823	With Slick Offense, U.C.L.A. Proves To Be Worthy No. 1	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E5D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	With conference play beginning in earnest across the country this weekend, it has become clear that this college basketball season is playing out in the same frenetic manner as the N.C.A.A. tournament last spring.\nThen, there was such a rash of upsets that victories by teams from smaller conferences over traditional powers became almost blasé. But amid the tumult, one of the few certainties in this college basketball season was on display at Pauley Pavilion on Sunday. Top-ranked U.C.L.A. thrashed No. 14 Washington, 96-74, in front of a crowd of 12,042, showing why the Bruins are the favorites to win the national title.\n''At this stage we are much further ahead than a year ago at this time,'' Bruins Coach Ben Howland said.\nLast season, U.C.L.A. clubbed its way to the national title game before being trounced by Florida, the eventual champion. This year, the Bruins are a remarkably improved offensive unit.\nU.C.L.A. (13-0, 2-0 Pacific-10) made 72 percent of its shots in the second half, got a career-high 27 points on 11-for-15 shooting from the star guard Arron Afflalo and finished with 29 assists as a team.\nAfter U.C.L.A. struggled to defeat Washington State on Thursday, Howland called the offense ''inept.'' But based on Sunday's performance, that game appeared to be an aberration. Afflalo and the starting point guard Darren Collison finished with a combined 20 assists and 2 turnovers. Collison's 12 assists were a career high.\n''That's a spectacular line right there,'' Howland said. ''It's a pretty good duo.''\nCollison, a star track athlete in high school, has made many U.C.L.A. fans forget about last season's starter at point guard, Jordan Farmar, who was a first-round pick by the Lakers.\nCollison has made the seamless transition from trusty reserve to invaluable starter and with it the Bruins are averaging about 78 points a game, more than 10 points higher than last season. Howland, who coached Pittsburgh from 1999 to 2003, called this the best offensive team he has coached in the past eight years.\n''Last year our problem was getting the ball in the hoop,'' Collison said. ''This year I think we're a lot more improved offensively.''\nThat has come while still holding opponents to an average of under 60 points a game, the same neighborhood the Bruins were in last season. U.C.L.A.'s defensive intensity, which has become a hallmark of Howland-coached teams, was also on display Sunday, with the Bruins forcing Washington into 22 turnovers.\nHowland said one of the reasons the Bruins were scoring more is that they were creating a lot of fast-break baskets from their defensive pressure. U.C.L.A. is forcing 18.7 turnovers a game, compared with 14.4 last season. The Bruins outscored Washington, 34-17, off turnovers on Sunday. None were more memorable than the second basket of the game, when a Bruins steal led to a violent jam in transition from the sophomore Luc Richard Mbah a Moute.\nAside from a revved-up offense, perhaps the other biggest difference in this U.C.L.A. team is its depth, a nod to Howland's recruiting and player development. The Bruins gave 10 players significant minutes on Sunday.\nThe sophomore guard Michael Roll scored 15 points off the bench. The reserve freshman forward James Keefe hit a foul-line jumper to loosen up the zone Washington dropped into in the second half. Another reserve big man, Ryan Wright, gave Howland eight quality minutes. ''We answered the bell,'' Howland said. ''That was a good team that we beat today. They're going to win a lot of games and be in the N.C.A.A. tournament.''\nWashington (10-3), though, is now 0-2 in the conference after losing in double overtime at Southern California on Thursday. Their struggles are a good barometer for the toughness of the Pac-10.\n''I'm telling you, this league is the best league in the country,'' Howland said. ''I really believe that. It's going to be a long, hard-fought deal.''\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL

1815825	No Denying That 'Granddaddy' Has Become Poor Relation	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E4D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Even Chad Henne, the Michigan quarterback, called this year's Rose Bowl ''almost like a consolation match.'' And Henne is as enthusiastic as anyone about Monday's game between the Wolverines and Southern California in Pasadena.\nThere is just no avoiding the feeling of a letdown because Ohio State, ranked first in the Bowl Championship Series standings, will play Florida, ranked second, in the B.C.S. national championship game on Jan. 8 in Glendale, Ariz.\nThe Wolverines of the Big Ten and Trojans of the Pacific-10 had each hoped to play for the B.C.S. championship but lost their regular-season finales to their biggest conference rivals -- -- the Wolverines to Ohio State, the Trojans to U.C.L.A.\nThis has turned the ''Granddaddy of Them All'' into something of a stepchild despite the pairing of two glamorous teams from the two leagues that traditionally play here. U.S.C. Coach Pete Carroll acknowledged the perception Sunday when asked if the B.C.S. had done a disservice to the Rose Bowl and other major postseason games.\n''There has been an effect on the games and how you can posture these games in terms of importance,'' Carroll said. ''Is that bad? Has that taken something away from it? I don't know who's worried about the conscience or the stature of these games.''\nBut based on the teams' rankings, the Rose Bowl would be the second-best bowl game. The Wolverines (11-1) are third in the B.C.S., the Trojans (10-2) fifth.\nThere remains a minuscule chance that a Florida (12-1) upset of Ohio State (12-0) in a ragged game, coupled with a Michigan rout of U.S.C., might encourage voters in the Associated Press poll, which is not affiliated with the B.C.S., to award Michigan a slice of an unofficial national championship.\nBut that is unlikely. With both Michigan and U.S.C. planning on the return of many star players next season, the Rose Bowl winner may earn only the right to be considered first in the nation when preseason rankings are compiled for 2007.\nMichigan linebacker Shawn Crable said he did not think the Rose Bowl would make or break next season, but he added, ''Next season, we might see them again.''\nThe Trojans are 21-9 in the Rose Bowl, but lost their last appearance, to Texas last season, when it was the B.C.S. championship game. The Wolverines are 8-11 here and have lost their last two visits, to Texas in 2005 and to U.S.C. in 2004. But Michigan is thought to be improved from those seasons, while U.S.C. had a less-impressive season, by its high standards.\nCrable and defensive end LaMarr Woodley give the Michigan defense star power, Carroll said. They will target Trojans quarterback John David Booty, much as they attacked Troy Smith of Ohio State.\nDespite losing by 42-39 to the Buckeyes on Nov. 18, the Wolverines punished Smith with many hard hits. Booty is less mobile than Smith, who won the Heisman Trophy, and the Wolverines have watched film of Booty's subpar performance when the Bruins upset the Trojans, 13-9, on Dec. 2.\n''Being a pass rusher, I saw them coming off the edge,'' Woodley said, referring to the Bruins' pass rush against Booty. ''We might do some similar things to him.''\nOf the Michigan front four, Booty said: ''The big guys can bull rush up the middle and then speed rush on the outside. Usually, teams have one or the other and you can move outside or step up. But it looks like, with them, you can't really do either.''\nHenne, a junior, said he planned to return next season, as did the junior running back Mike Hart. Jake Long, an all-American offensive tackle who will be a fifth-year senior, has also said he would come back.\nHenne has a strong receiving corps, including the senior Steve Breaston, the sophomore Mario Manningham and the junior Adrian Arrington. Among those who will cover them is an 18-year-old freshman free safety, Taylor Mays.\nMays's father, Stafford Mays, played professionally for Minnesota when Carroll was an assistant coach for the Vikings.\nThe younger Mays got his first start in the second game because of an injury. Is he ready for the pressure of the Rose Bowl? ''I haven't really had time to be nervous,'' Mays said.\nThe Trojans' star receiver, Dwayne Jarrett, will go against his friend Leon Hall, the star cornerback of Michigan. When asked about the anti-climactic feeling of the Rose Bowl, Jarrett said: ''This is the game we have to play in. Just live with it.''\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL
1815827	Eagles Clinch the N.F.C. East, Then They Win Again	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE4D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	A few minutes into Sunday's game against Atlanta, a hard season finally got easy for the Philadelphia Eagles. The National Football Conference East was clinched for the fifth time in six seasons, win or lose against the Falcons.\nEventually, Philadelphia won its fifth game in a row, 24-17, on an 89-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter from the reserve quarterback A. J. Feeley to receiver Hank Baskett, setting up a playoff opener next Sunday here against the Giants and concluding a jarring day of celebration and anticlimax.\nWith 10 minutes 44 seconds remaining in the first quarter, word filtered to the well-oiled fans at Lincoln Financial Field: The hated Dallas Cowboys had lost at home to Detroit. So the Eagles (10-6) had won the division, a feat that seemed impossible in November after quarterback Donovan McNabb tore a ligament in his knee and Philadelphia hobbled to five defeats in six games.\nThe 69,341 fans stood and cheered Sunday, and many shouted a familiar, dismissive curse at the Cowboys. It was an incongruous moment, considering that Atlanta was driving for a temporary 7-3 lead. No matter. The New Year's Eve celebration had officially begun for the Eagles and their faithful.\nQuarterback Jeff Garcia and running back Brian Westbrook went to the bench after one series. More regulars soon followed. In this fragile season, Coach Andy Reid was taking no chances. The game became a glorified scrimmage, highlighted by Feeley's 22 completions on 33 attempts for 331 yards and 3 touchdowns.\nAs the Eagles' unlikely late-season revival continued, Philadelphia's supporters were able to revel in the underdog role they have long embraced, and to anticipate the Giants in the wild-card matchup. If the Eagles are not the best team in the N.F.C., they are the hottest.\n''We're a little like zombies,'' Reid said. ''Back from the dead.''\nPlaying a division rival for a third time this season will not bring complete assurance to the locals. They remember all too queasily how the Giants recovered from a 24-7 deficit here Sept. 17 and won, 30-24, in overtime. And Philadelphia's 36-22 victory at Giants Stadium on Dec. 17 was not secured without 22 points in the fourth quarter, including an interception returned for a touchdown.\n''It was a good one,'' Reid said of the N.F.C. East title, but added, ''We're not done. The Giants are coming in. We know how those games go.''\nFor a moment, though, the Giants could wait. This was a day for the players and the fans to savor Philadelphia's resilience in a season recovered, like a misplaced overcoat, from the lost and found.\nShawn Andrews, the Pro Bowl guard, jumped up and down on the field like a kid with a newly opened present. Fireworks exploded from the rim of the stadium.\nSome Eagles fans placed the revival in a cinematic context, noting that the season was bookended by two Philadelphia-inspired films -- ''Invincible,'' the story of Vince Papale, who did not play college football and made the Eagles in a public tryout in 1976; and ''Rocky Balboa,'' the latest in a series that for three decades has glorified the city's blue-collar ethos.\n''We always see ourselves as the underdogs,'' Emily Ditzler of Lansdale, Pa., said. ''It's the whole ''Rocky'' thing. A lot of it has to do with the recovery from last year and fighting our way back. Everyone said we couldn't win. We wanted to prove we could do something without T. O.'' After a 6-10 season a year ago, which included a dyspeptic McNabb-Terrell Owens feud that led to Owens being discarded, the Eagles started this season 4-1, only to have McNabb wreck his knee. Many fans preferred Feeley, not Garcia, as McNabb's replacement, and even booed Garcia during a Monday night game against Carolina on Dec. 4.\nBut Garcia threw a 40-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter, Philadelphia won, 27-24. It has not lost since, winning three consecutive division games on the road and balancing its passing with a clock-chewing running game.\nNow, Garcia has been seamlessly folded into Philadelphia's underdog myth -- a 36-year-old, undrafted out of college, unwanted largely by the N.F.L. after recent horrid seasons in Detroit and Cleveland.\n''We love him, first, because he's winning,'' Shaun Young, a fan from Media, Pa., said. ''We love his energy; he gets in guy's faces. He's a blue-collar guy; he's been through a lot.''\nBut this is Philadelphia, after all. Affection here blinks on and off like traffic lights. And the playoffs have yet to start.\n''He's no-nonsense and he's winning,'' Fran DiBeneditto of Downingtown, Pa., said of Garcia. ''If we were losing, he could be fiery and we'd hate him.''\nPRO FOOTBALL
1815828	Knicks Have a Hard Time Dealing With Rejection	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE4D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	After running through the gamut of emotions, from the highest highs late last week to another stupefying low Sunday afternoon, the Knicks were left with a bad case of whiplash.\nThen again, the condition might simply have been a product of watching their shots fly in the opposite direction. The Knicks converted a season-low 34.5 percent of their field-goals attempts Sunday, in large part because 16 of their attempts were swatted away by the Los Angeles Clippers, who cruised to a 90-80 victory at the Staples Center.\nElton Brand accounted for eight of those blocks, a career high, and scored an efficient 32 points to ruin the Knicks' New Year's Eve. The defeat denied the Knicks (13-20) a chance to claim a share of first place in the Atlantic Division. It prevented them from recording a .500 record in December, leaving them 7-9. And, combined with Friday night's lopsided loss in Phoenix, it wiped out all the exhilaration of the previous two weeks. That triple-overtime victory last week against Detroit already seems like a distant memory.\n''I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't frustrated right now,'' forward David Lee said. ''All our guys are frustrated.''\nThe Knicks trailed wire to wire, by as many as 24 points, and never got closer than 10 in the second half. They also trailed by as many as 24 points in Phoenix, where they never got closer than 11. But the Clippers (14-16) are not the Suns, and Coach Isiah Thomas surely expected his team to have learned something in Saturday's extensive film session here.\nBut there are lessons that still elude them and the most damaging one is how to keep the offense rolling when Eddy Curry is double-teamed. The Clippers, like the Suns, crowded Curry every time he touched the ball. Curry made 5 of 13 shots, and six of his seven misses were blocked. He finished with 15 points.\n''It seemed like they were coming from everywhere tonight,'' Curry said.\nThe Knicks do not have the shooters to keep defenses honest. Indeed, their forward rotation is littered with players who have no reliable jump shot -- Lee, Jared Jeffries and Renaldo Balkman. Jeffries played just 15 minutes Sunday.\n''I don't think it's Eddy's fault, whatsoever,'' Lee said. ''He's getting double-teamed and guys need to step up and make a play, myself included.''\nIt would help to have the injured Quentin Richardson back. But the Knicks also need Curry to take the next step as a franchise player, and diversify his game.\n''It's just different because of how they're guarding Eddy now,'' Stephon Marbury said. ''Once Eddy understands that he's going to be double-teamed for the remainder of his career, it's going to be tough for us until he understands that. He's starting to learn that when the trap comes to kick it out right away and repost. This is all brand new to him.''\nThomas tried everything Sunday -- playing Curry and Jerome James as co-centers, benching Jeffries for long stretches, and leaning hard on the rookie Mardy Collins. Curry and Jamal Crawford were on the bench in the fourth quarter when a unit featuring James, Collins, Lee, Marbury and Channing Frye cut a 24-point deficit to 84-74 with 3 minutes 36 seconds to play. The Clippers responded with three quick baskets.\n''I was just searching, pushing every button I could push tonight,'' Thomas said. ''And I finally got a group out there that had some semblance of working together and I just tried to stick with it.''\nWhile Richardson missed his eighth game in a row because of back spasms, the Knicks' guards had another terrible shooting performance. Crawford was 2 for 8 and Marbury 3 for 13. Collins, in his first game back from a suspension, was the best shooter, hitting 4 of 9 shots, including three 3-pointers. He finished with a career-high 11 points and is likely to keep his rotation spot while Richardson and Steve Francis recover from injuries.\n''He was definitely a bright spot,'' Thomas said of Collins. ''I hope I can keep finding him minutes.''\nFor Collins, every game is a chance to make a name for himself. Until then, the image of him is as the guy who committed the flagrant foul that set off the brawl with Denver.\n''It's definitely tough to be known, the first thing you come in the league, to be known as a guy that's like this and like that,'' Collins said. ''So my whole thing is to try to go out there and prove to them and show them I can actually play basketball, try to forget about the whole situation.''\nREBOUNDS\nSteve Francis was back in a suit and tie Sunday afternoon, resting his right knee (tendinitis). Francis played sparingly last week, when the Knicks desperately needed another guard, but he was limited. ''I can't do anything,'' Francis said. ''It's constant pain at all times. I couldn't run or stop.'' Nate Robinson, barred from attending N.B.A. games during his suspension, went to the U.C.L.A.-Washington game at Pauley Pavilion. Robinson played three years for Washington before being drafted by the Knicks in 2005.\nPRO BASKETBALL\nCorrection: January 3, 2007, Wednesday A sports article on Monday about the Knicks' 90-80 loss to the Clippers in Los Angeles misidentified the team that drafted guard Nate Robinson in 2005. It was the Phoenix Suns, who selected him at the Knicks' request, then traded him and Quentin Richardson to the Knicks for Kurt Thomas the same day; the Knicks did not draft Robinson.
1815829	McNabb Watches and Wonders About the Future	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E3D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The scene inside Suite 48 at Lincoln Financial Field yesterday was warm, lively and occasionally raucous. Donovan McNabb, the Philadelphia Eagles' injured quarterback, sat and cheered with his mother, Wilma; his father, Sam; and a cluster of friends and their children.\nThey bleed Eagles green.\nThis was the season finale, and the Eagles were playing the demoralized Atlanta Falcons in a game that was supposed to have been an electric crescendo to a fascinating season. If Dallas defeated Detroit at home, as was expected, then Philadelphia would have to defeat Atlanta to win the division.\nIn fitting fashion for a season defined by parity, the Lions upset the Cowboys, 39-31. Philadelphia, without lifting a finger, won its fifth National Football Conference East title in eight seasons.\nThe Eagles completed a fantastic run, a run that assumed an extraordinary dimension on Nov. 19 when McNabb sustained a season-ending knee injury.\nEagles fans screamed for the backup A. J. Feeley, Coach Andy Reid gave them Jeff Garcia, and Garcia responded by giving Philadelphia a season to remember.\nThe underlying question in Suite 48 was whether Eagles fans will remember McNabb. This was the subject of a blog posting last week written by McNabb's mother on his Web site. She wondered where her son's injury, and Garcia's performance in relief, would leave her son in the minds of the fans.\n''The win this week was great, and I could actually say that's what I wanted for Christmas,'' she wrote, referring to the Eagles' 23-7 victory over the Cowboys on Monday. ''Yes, now we have solidly beat the Cowboys with my son and without him. But I can hear you asking, mama McNabb what are you really thinking? Well here it is, the real deal.\n''It's kind of bittersweet for me as my son, the quarterback sits out on injured reserved watching the game during his rehab,'' she added. ''I polled my family too, and they feel the same. We want our team to win and even go to the Super Bowl and win it in Miami especially if they continue to play as they have. But oh oh, if they win the Super Bowl without my son, what would be the real outcome with the fans? Will they crucify him? Maybe, then the trade talks would begin.''\nMcNabb said yesterday that he really didn't want to talk about his injury and that he didn't want to be a distraction to the team. So he cheered lustily. ''I never get that many chances to do this,'' he said.\nPopularity is fragile. Jeff Garcia is the latest toast of Philadelphia, but we'll see how long that lasts. If the Eagles lose to the Giants next Sunday (and that is a real possibility), trust me, the fans will be screaming for McNabb.\nI spoke with McNabb recently when he was in New York announcing an initiative for managing diabetes. He spoke about the ups and downs of playing quarterback, the most intriguing position in team sports. It doesn't matter if you're McNabb or Garcia, Eli or Peyton Manning. Acceptance hangs by a thread.\n''It's grueling,'' McNabb said then. ''You have a great game, and they talk about us like we're the best thing since sliced bread. But as soon as you have that bad game, it's like darts are flying your way. That comes with the territory, and it's something you just have to deal with.''\nMcNabb and the organization will have to deal with this as long as the Eagles keep winning with Garcia.\nIn 2004, McNabb became the third African-American quarterback to play in a Super Bowl. Being an African-American quarterback adds yet another layer to the pressure that goes along with the position. Despite the success of Vince Young and Steve McNair, McNabb believes that he may be held to higher standards, may be on a shorter leash.\nHe was marginalized by Rush Limbaugh, roasted by the local N.A.A.C.P. president and showed up by a star receiver, Terrell Owens.\nWhen asked about society's acceptance of African-American quarterbacks, McNabb said: ''I personally don't feel that we've turned the corner. We get criticized a little differently from most people. It's always, 'We've got to get somebody else in there,' or 'He's not doing what he needs to do,' when in a lot of cases, I'm doing the same thing someone else is doing but better.''\nWill Eagles fans rally behind McNabb next season, for old time's sake, or will they adopt Garcia?\nKyle Leyrer of Royers, Pa., 23, was in the parking lot before yesterday's game. ''I still like McNabb,'' Leyrer said. ''He's one of the greats in Eagles history. He'll be Hall of Famer.''\nAsked about Garcia's success, Leyrer said, ''McNabb would be doing the same thing if he was playing.''\nMcNabb turned 30 last month. His body has taken punishment: a broken ankle, a sports hernia, busted ribs and now this knee injury. The Eagles have played in four N.F.C. championship games in the past five years and reached the Super Bowl after the 2004 season, losing to New England.\nThe Eagles defeated Atlanta, 24-17, yesterday and will play host to a playoff game Sunday. McNabb will be in Suite 48 cheering and hurting, bleeding Eagles green, wondering if the totality of what he has accomplished in Philadelphia will be enough to make fans remember his name in the new year.\nI think McNabb will be fine. Philadelphia lost a major chunk of its soul when Allen Iverson was traded to Denver. The city doesn't want to lose its spirit as well.\nSPORTS OF THE TIMES E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com
1815830	For Sunnis, Dictator's Degrading End Signals Ominous Dawn for the New Iraq	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	For Sunni Arabs here, the ugly reality of the new Iraq seemed to crystallize in a two-minute segment of Saddam Hussein's hanging, filmed surreptitiously on a cellphone.\nThe video featured excited taunting of Mr. Hussein by hooded Shiite guards. Passed around from cellphone to cellphone on Sunday, the images had echoes of the videos Sunni militants take of beheadings.\n''Yes, he was a dictator, but he was killed by a death squad,'' said a Sunni Arab woman in western Baghdad who was too afraid to give her name. ''What's the difference between him and them?''\nThere was, of course, a difference. Mr. Hussein was a brutal dictator, while the Shiite organizers of the execution are members of the popularly elected Iraqi government that the United States helped put in place as an attempt to implant a democracy.\nIt was supposed to be a formal and solemn proceeding carried out by a dispassionate state. But the grainy recording of the execution's cruel theater summed up what has become increasingly clear on the streets of the capital: that the Shiite-led government that assumed power in the American effort here is running the state under an undisguised sectarian banner.\nThe hanging was hasty. Laws governing its timing were bypassed, and the guards charged with keeping order in the chamber instead disrupted it, shouting Shiite militia slogans.\nIt was a degrading end for a vicious leader, and an ominous beginning for the new Iraq. The Bush administration has already scaled back its hopes for a democracy here. But as the Iraqi government has become ever more set on protecting its Shiite constituency, often at the expense of the Sunni minority, the goal of stopping the sectarian war seems to be slipping out of reach.\n''We speak about the crimes of Saddam Hussein, but now here we are behaving in the same way,'' said Alaa Makki, a prominent Sunni politician. ''We fear that nothing has been changed. On the contrary, we feel it is going in a worse direction.''\nAfter the invasion, Sunni Arabs, bitter at losing their place, refused to take part in Iraq's first elections, allowing Shiites and Kurds to sweep to power. Americans here spent the following months persuading the Shiites to let the Sunnis back in.\nThe idea, at the time, was that involving Sunnis in politics would drain the insurgency of its violence. Instead, the violence got worse, and in February, the long-abused Shiites struck back, using the force of the state ministries and agencies that they now control.\nNow, American officials are pressing Iraqi leaders, both Sunni and Shiite, to reconcile and have made it a central demand for continued support of the Iraqi government. But the prospects for mutual agreement seem ever more distant.\n''I can't think of any good reason for any level-minded person to be interested in reconciliation,'' one secular Sunni politician said.\nThat unwillingness, shared by most of the Shiite political elite, is a serious challenge to any new American strategy proposal that President Bush may announce soon.\nIndeed, the Sunni political class is getting smaller. Many of the Sunni politicians once ubiquitous during the broad discussions of the Iraqi Constitution two years ago are now gone. Virtually none of the members of the Association of Muslim Scholars, a hard-line Sunni Arab religious group, are left in Iraq -- most of them have gone to Jordan and Syria. Out of more than 50 members of the Baghdad council that runs the city, only one is Sunni.\nThe reason is that Shiites, who had been driven from their homes and relentlessly slaughtered by Sunni suicide bombers, are now pushing back. The taunting during Mr. Hussein's execution capped months of advances by Shiite militias, which have forced Sunnis farther back into western Baghdad. But as the Shiites gain the upper hand, they also seem to be abandoning any hint of compromise.\nThe video, Sunnis said, was a startling symbol of that. In the images, the guards taunt Mr. Hussein. They damn him. They cheer their Shiite heroes so persistently that one observer makes a remark about how the effort to rein in militias does not seem to be going well.\nImmediately after they let him drop, in the midst of repeating a prayer, the voices rise in urgency and begin talking excitedly.\nThen several others chime in, telling those present to step back from the body and to wait three minutes before touching it.\nThe video was particularly disturbing for Sunni Arabs, who accuse the government of willfully allowing militias to remain in the ranks of its security forces. It left the impression that the government cared more for revenge than for justice, Sunnis said.\n''Either it's terrible incompetence or it's an act of revenge -- a vendetta,'' said Adnan Pachachi, a respected Sunni whose political career began long before Mr. Hussein took power. ''That was the impression people had.''\nOne of the problems was the timing. The execution was rescheduled a number of times, as Iraqi officials raced through a checklist of requirements put forth by the Americans. Two legal conditions -- that it not be held on a holiday and that the Iraqi president and his two deputies be given 30 days to sign off on the sentence first -- were ignored.\nThe fact was not lost on Sunni political leaders, including Mr. Makki, who said the execution was a step backward for the country.\n''This is a political mistake,'' he said. ''We lost a lot with this.''\nTo make matters worse, it fell just as the first day of the Id al-Adha holiday dawned for Sunnis -- a day before the Shiites' observance was to begin. Shiite politicians did not apologize and some even reveled in the timing. That did a major disservice to reconciliation, many argued.\n''Why couldn't they have waited for a few more days?'' Mr. Pachachi said. ''It was a deliberate insult to so many people. It helped Saddam's friends.''\nYusra Abdul Aziz, a Sunni teacher in Mansour, had a blunter analysis: ''They changed him from a criminal into a martyr.''\nIn a strange twist, Sunni insurgents did not seem to care. Sunni Jihadist Web sites had virtually no messages about Mr. Hussein's death, aside from two re-released statements, old debates by militant sheiks over whether he should be considered a martyr.\n''The feeling is that they don't care about him,'' said Rita Katz, who runs the SITE Institute, a group that tracks militant Islamist Web sites.\nFor the more hard-line Sunni Arabs, the execution simply confirmed their view that joining the Shiite government could never work. Sheik Hakam Abdullah al-Shahiri from the Obeid tribe in Kirkuk is an example. ''Iraq is occupied now by the U.S. and Iran and a puppet government for both sides,'' he said. ''With the execution of Saddam the Arab identity of Iraq and its unity have ended.''\nThat has left moderate Sunnis -- those who still seek reconciliation -- to ponder the danger of a Shiite hegemony that seems too scarred from past abuses to govern lightly.\n''Governing a country should not be done by reflexes,'' Mr. Makki said. ''It should be wisdom first. A panoramic view.''\n''Not behaving from one side,'' he added, ''like what we saw here.''\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: NEWS ANALYSIS
1815831	Graphic Video of Execution Presents Hard Choices for U.S. Media	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E2D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Confronted with a second, unofficial and more graphic video account of the moments leading up to the execution of Saddam Hussein, and the hanging itself, executives at television news organizations made a series of what one executive, President Steve Capus of NBC News, called ''delicate editorial decisions'' about what they would put on the air on Saturday night and Sunday to augment the first pictures of the execution.\nThe new video, almost certainly shot by a cellphone camera by one of the guards or witnesses at the execution, includes exchanges between Mr. Hussein and either the witnesses or guards leading up to the moment when the trapdoor opens and he falls. No national American television organization has thus far allowed the moment of the drop to be shown.\nBut the same niceties were not observed on numerous Web sites, which have posted the complete video, including the moment that Mr. Hussein, noose around his neck, falls, and a close-up of his face afterward. Some prominent sites, like Google's video site and the conservative blog Littlegreenfootballs.com, have posted the complete cellphone coverage of the execution, including the moment Mr. Hussein falls from view.\nFox News and CNN ran the cellphone video -- freezing on Mr. Hussein's face before the final moment -- most of the day on Sunday. Fox was the first to use the video on Saturday evening, after the Arab-language channel Al Jazeera aired it. ABC ran some of the video starting in its late newscasts Saturday night.\nDavid Rhodes, the vice president for news at Fox News, said one reason the network chose to transmit the new video was that it contained the verbal exchanges between Mr. Hussein and those about to put him to death. Most television news executives interviewed Sunday said these hostile exchanges made the new video newsworthy. Jon Klein, the president of CNN's domestic operations, said the flavor of sectarianism cinched the decision. ''It really was a microcosm of the various strains in Iraqi society at the moment,'' he said.\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ\nCorrection: January 4, 2007, Thursday An article on Monday about the handling of the video of Saddam Hussein's execution by television networks and Web sites referred imprecisely to the site littlegreenfootballs.com. It posted a link to the video, not the video itself.
1815832	While Favre Shows Greatness, Grossman Worries Chicago	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E2D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	While the Green Bay Packers wonder about Brett Favre's future, the Chicago Bears worry about Rex Grossman as they head into the playoffs.\nGreen Bay's 26-7 victory Sunday night at Soldier Field had no playoff ramifications, but the game was significant for both starting quarterbacks. For Favre, the game was potentially historic. For Grossman, it was a nightmare.\nIt may have been the final game for Favre, Green Bay's surefire Hall of Famer, who remains uncertain if he will retire or return for another season. Favre, 37, played splendidly, completing 21 of 42 passes for 285 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. If this was goodbye, it was a satisfying farewell.\nAfter the game, Favre said he would have surgery on his left ankle in Green Bay to clean out bone spurs. He said he expected to announce in the next two or three weeks whether he would return. Favre ran off the field after the game with tears in his eyes.\n''If it is the last game, I couldn't be more pleased,'' he said during his postgame news conference. ''I've had a blast this year. Every player in pro sports would love to go out winning a championship. It's hard to do.''\nGrossman, however, left many Bears fans wishing that he would retire, or at least be replaced. He threw three interceptions in the first half, and two of them were returned for touchdowns. Grossman looked shaky and unsure, going 2 of 12 for 33 yards. He is the Bears' biggest concern as they prepare for a potential run to the Super Bowl.\nFinishing with the best record in the National Football Conference earned the Bears (13-3) a first-round bye before they open the playoffs at home Jan. 13 or 14. If Grossman plays as poorly as he did in this game, however, the Bears are likely to exit the playoffs quickly, home field and bye notwithstanding.\n''Everything that could go wrong went wrong,'' Grossman said. ''I've been in this position before. I'm going to go into my fort and fight my way out.''\nAt this point, it would be hard to believe that every player in the Bears' locker room agrees with Coach Lovie Smith's loyalty to Grossman. But it would also seem improbable that Smith would replace Grossman with Brian Griese for the playoffs, after hardly playing Griese all season.\nSmith said that he would not make a quarterback change and that, regardless of how Grossman was playing Sunday, he had planned to take him out of the game sometime during the third quarter.\n''I didn't think there was any need to put him back in after an effort like that,'' Smith said.\nAsked if Grossman's performance concerned him, Smith said, ''Our team's performance concerns me.''\nGriese struggled initially, playing the second half in place of Grossman, after Green Bay had built a 20-0 lead. But Griese took the field to cheers from the many fans who have turned on Grossman; they cheered even louder late in the third quarter, when Griese hit Michael Bradley for a 75-yard touchdown pass.\nWhen Smith looks at videotape of this game, he will see a flustered starting quarterback. With Green Bay already leading by 7-0, Nick Collins read Grossman perfectly, stepping in front of a short pass intended for tight end Desmond Clark. Once Collins intercepted the pass, he easily ran past Grossman for a 55-yard touchdown.\nFrom that point, Grossman's mistakes snowballed. He fumbled on the next series, and Green Bay recovered. On the series after that, Grossman hurried a pass under pressure, and cornerback Charles Woodson stepped in for another interception.\nLate in the first half, a Grossman pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage by Corey Williams and intercepted by linebacker Patrick Dendy, who raced 30 yards for another touchdown.\nThe Packers finished 8-8, a solid start in the rebuilding plan of the first-year coach Mike McCarthy, who has said that he wants Favre to return. Favre led the Packers to a touchdown drive on their opening possession, whipping a pass to Donald Driver on a slant pattern for a 9-yard touchdown. It was Favre's 414th career touchdown pass, and it might have been his last.\nBut while Favre has time to make a decision, the Bears have less time to sort out their quarterback issues before the playoffs.\nPRO FOOTBALL
1815834	From Father to Son, Last Words to Live By	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE2D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	He drew pictures of himself with angel wings. He left a set of his dog tags on a nightstand in my Manhattan apartment. He bought a tiny blue sweat suit for our baby to wear home from the hospital.\nThen he began to write what would become a 200-page journal for our son, in case he did not make it back from the desert in Iraq.\nFor months before my fiancé, First Sgt. Charles Monroe King, kissed my swollen stomach and said goodbye, he had been preparing for the beginning of the life we had created and for the end of his own.\nHe boarded a plane in December 2005 with two missions, really -- to lead his young soldiers in combat and to prepare our boy for a life without him.\nDear son, Charles wrote on the last page of the journal, ''I hope this book is somewhat helpful to you. Please forgive me for the poor handwriting and grammar. I tried to finish this book before I was deployed to Iraq. It has to be something special to you. I've been writing it in the states, Kuwait and Iraq.\nThe journal will have to speak for Charles now. He was killed Oct. 14 when an improvised explosive device detonated near his armored vehicle in Baghdad. Charles, 48, had been assigned to the Army's First Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, Fourth Infantry Division, based in Fort Hood, Tex. He was a month from completing his tour of duty.\nFor our son's first Christmas, Charles had hoped to take him on a carriage ride through Central Park. Instead, Jordan, now 9 months old, and I snuggled under a blanket in a horse-drawn buggy. The driver seemed puzzled about why I was riding alone with a baby and crying on Christmas Day. I told him.\n''No charge,'' he said at the end of the ride, an act of kindness in a city that can magnify loneliness.\nOn paper, Charles revealed himself in a way he rarely did in person. He thought hard about what to say to a son who would have no memory of him. Even if Jordan will never hear the cadence of his father's voice, he will know the wisdom of his words.\nNever be ashamed to cry. No man is too good to get on his knee and humble himself to God. Follow your heart and look for the strength of a woman.\nCharles tried to anticipate questions in the years to come. Favorite team? I am a diehard Cleveland Browns fan. Favorite meal? Chicken, fried or baked, candied yams, collard greens and cornbread. Childhood chores? Shoveling snow and cutting grass. First kiss? Eighth grade.\nIn neat block letters, he wrote about faith and failure, heartache and hope. He offered tips on how to behave on a date and where to hide money on vacation. Rainy days have their pleasures, he noted: Every now and then you get lucky and catch a rainbow.\nCharles mailed the book to me in July, after one of his soldiers was killed and he had recovered the body from a tank. The journal was incomplete, but the horror of the young man's death shook Charles so deeply that he wanted to send it even though he had more to say. He finished it when he came home on a two-week leave in August to meet Jordan, then 5 months old. He was so intoxicated by love for his son that he barely slept, instead keeping vigil over the baby.\nI can fill in some of the blanks left for Jordan about his father. When we met in my hometown of Radcliff, Ky., near Fort Knox, I did not consider Charles my type at first. He was bashful, a homebody and got his news from television rather than newspapers (heresy, since I'm a New York Times editor).\nBut he won me over. One day a couple of years ago, I pulled out a list of the traits I wanted in a husband and realized that Charles had almost all of them. He rose early to begin each day with prayers and a list of goals that he ticked off as he accomplished them. He was meticulous, even insisting on doing my ironing because he deemed my wrinkle-removing skills deficient. His rock-hard warrior's body made him appear tough, but he had a tender heart.\nHe doted on Christina, now 16, his daughter from a marriage that ended in divorce. He made her blush when he showed her a tattoo with her name on his arm. Toward women, he displayed an old-fashioned chivalry, something he expected of our son. Remember who taught you to speak, to walk and to be a gentleman, he wrote to Jordan in his journal. These are your first teachers, my little prince. Protect them, embrace them and always treat them like a queen.\nThough as a black man he sometimes felt the sting of discrimination, Charles betrayed no bitterness. It's not fair to judge someone by the color of their skin, where they're raised or their religious beliefs, he wrote. Appreciate people for who they are and learn from their differences.\nHe had his faults, of course. Charles could be moody, easily wounded and infuriatingly quiet, especially during an argument. And at times, I felt, he put the military ahead of family.\nHe had enlisted in 1987, drawn by the discipline and challenges. Charles had other options -- he was a gifted artist who had trained at the Art Institute of Chicago -- but felt fulfilled as a soldier, something I respected but never really understood. He had a chest full of medals and a fierce devotion to his men.\nHe taught the youngest, barely out of high school, to balance their checkbooks, counseled them about girlfriends and sometimes bailed them out of jail. When he was home in August, I had a baby shower for him. One guest recently reminded me that he had spent much of the evening worrying about his troops back in Iraq.\nCharles knew the perils of war. During the months before he went away and the days he returned on leave, we talked often about what might happen. In his journal, he wrote about the loss of fellow soldiers. Still, I could not bear to answer when Charles turned to me one day and asked, ''You don't think I'm coming back, do you?'' We never said aloud that the fear that he might not return was why we decided to have a child before we planned a wedding, rather than risk never having the chance.\nBut Charles missed Jordan's birth because he refused to take a leave from Iraq until all of his soldiers had gone home first, a decision that hurt me at first. And he volunteered for the mission on which he died, a military official told his sister, Gail T. King. Although he was not required to join the resupply convoy in Baghdad, he believed that his soldiers needed someone experienced with them. ''He would say, 'My boys are out there, I've got to go check on my boys,' '' said First Sgt. Arenteanis A. Jenkins, Charles's roommate in Iraq.\nIn my grief, that decision haunts me. Charles's father faults himself for not begging his son to avoid taking unnecessary risks. But he acknowledges that it would not have made a difference. ''He was a born leader,'' said his father, Charlie J. King. ''And he believed what he was doing was right.''\nBack in April, after a roadside bombing remarkably similar to that which would claim him, Charles wrote about death and duty.\nThe 18th was a long, solemn night, he wrote in Jordan's journal. We had a memorial for two soldiers who were killed by an improvised explosive device. None of my soldiers went to the memorial. Their excuse was that they didn't want to go because it was depressing. I told them it was selfish of them not to pay their respects to two men who were selfless in giving their lives for their country.\nThings may not always be easy or pleasant for you, that's life, but always pay your respects for the way people lived and what they stood for. It's the honorable thing to do.\nWhen Jordan is old enough to ask how his father died, I will tell him of Charles's courage and assure him of Charles's love. And I will try to comfort him with his father's words.\nGod blessed me above all I could imagine, Charles wrote in the journal. I have no regrets, serving your country is great.\nHe had tucked a message to me in the front of Jordan's journal. This is the letter every soldier should write, he said. For us, life will move on through Jordan. He will be an extension of us and hopefully everything that we stand for. I would like to see him grow up to be a man, but only God knows what the future holds.\nTHE CONFLICT IN IRAQ: AN APPRECIATION
1815835	3,000 Deaths in Iraq, Countless Tears at Home	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Jordan W. Hess was the unlikeliest of soldiers.\nHe could bench-press 300 pounds and then go home and write poetry. He learned the art of glass blowing because it seemed interesting and built a computer with only a magazine as his guide. Most recently, he fell in love with a woman from Brazil and took up digital photography, letting both sweep his heart away.\nSpecialist Hess, the seventh of eight children, was never keen on premonitions, but on Christmas of 2005, as his tight-knit family gathered on a beach for the weekend, he told each sibling and parent privately that he did not expect to come home from Iraq.\nOn Nov. 11, Specialist Hess, 26, freshly arrived in Iraq, was conducting a mission as the driver of an Abrams tank when an improvised explosive device, or I.E.D., blew up with brain-rattling force. The blast was so potent it penetrated the 67-ton tank, flinging him against the top and critically injuring his spine. His four crewmates survived. For three weeks, he hung on at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, long enough to utter a few words to his loved ones and absorb their kindness.\nOn Dec. 4, Specialist Hess slipped onto the ever-expanding list of American military fatalities in Iraq, one that has increased by an average of more than three a day since Oct. 1, the highest three-month toll in two years. On Sunday, with the announcement of the death in Baghdad of Specialist Dustin R. Donica, 22, of Spring, Tex., the list reached the somber milestone of at least 3,000 deaths since the March 2003 invasion.\nThe landmark reflects how much more dangerous and muddled a soldier's job in Iraq has become in the face of a growing and increasingly sophisticated insurgency. Violence in the country is at an all-time high, according to a Pentagon report released last month. December was the third deadliest month for American troops since the start of the war, with insurgents claiming 111 soldiers' lives. October and November also witnessed a high number of casualties, 106 and 68 respectively, as American forces stepped up combat operations to try to stabilize Baghdad.\n''It escalated while I was there,'' said Capt. Scott Stanford, a National Guard officer who was a commander of a headquarters company in Ramadi for a year, arriving in June 2005. ''When we left this June, it was completely unhinged. There was a huge increase in the suicide car bombs we had. The I.E.D.'s were bigger and more complex.''\n''And it was very tense before we left in terms of snipers,'' said Captain Stanford, a member of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ''I don't know if there were more of them, or if they were getting better.''\nThis spike in violence, which has been felt most profoundly by Iraqi civilians, who are dying by the thousands, has stoked feverish debate about the nation's presence in Iraq. Many Democrats in Congress are urging a phased withdrawal from the country, and the Bush administration is leaning toward deploying additional troops in 2007. If the conflict continues into March, the Iraq war will be the third longest in American history, ranked behind the Vietnam War and the American Revolution.\nPresident Bush did not specifically acknowledge reaching the milestone of 3,000 American deaths, but a White House spokesman, Scott Stanzel, said the president ''grieves for each one that is lost'' and would ensure that their sacrifices were not made in vain. The campaign against terrorism, Mr. Stanzel said, will be a long struggle.\nSpecialist Hess had volunteered for his mission to spare another soldier the danger of going outside the wire that day. Like so many of his fallen comrades, he had become the victim of an inescapably dangerous roadside landscape.\n''It was the type of injury you rarely recover from; in past wars you wouldn't have gotten out of theater,'' said his father, Bill Hess, a Boeing engineer and retired Air Force man. ''So that was a blessing, that he could talk to us. He mouthed words and we were able to say we loved him. There is a lot to be said for that.''\nA Steady Toll of Deaths\nIn many ways, the third 1,000 men and women to die in Iraq faced the same unflinching challenge as the second 1,000 soldiers to die there -- a dedicated and ruthless Iraqi insurgency that has exploited the power of roadside bombs to chilling effect. These bombs now cause about half of all American combat deaths and injuries in Iraq.\nOver all, the casualty rate has remained relatively steady since 2005, dipping only slightly. It took 14 months for the death toll to jump to 2,000 soldiers from 1,000. It took about two weeks longer for it to rise to 3,000 from 2,000, during the period covering Oct. 25, 2005, to this week.\n''It is hugely frustrating, tragic and disappointing that we can't reduce the fatality rate,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a military analyst for the Brookings Institution.\nThe service members who died during this latest period fit an unchanging profile. They were mostly white men from rural areas, soldiers so young they still held fresh memories of high school football heroics and teenage escapades. Many men and women were in Iraq for the second or third time. Some were going on their fourth, fifth or sixth deployment.\nBut in other ways, the situation has changed in the past year. Improvised explosive devices -- the kind that killed Specialist Hess -- have grown deadlier, despite concerted Pentagon efforts and billions of dollars spent trying to counteract them. Insurgents are now more adept at concealing bombs, booby-trapping them and powering them to penetrate well-armored vehicles. They are also scattering more of them along countless roads using myriad triggers and hiding spots -- under garbage and tires, behind guardrails, inside craters.\nAt the same time, Iraqi citizens have grown less inclined to tip off soldiers to the presence of these bombs. About 1,200 roadside bombs were detonated in August.\nThe toll of war has fallen most heavily this year on regular Army soldiers, at least 544 of whom died in this group of 1,000, compared with 405 in the last group. This increase was the result of fewer National Guard soldiers and reservists being deployed to Iraq in 2006.\nConsidering the intensity of the violence in Iraq this year, it is remarkable that the casualty rate did not climb higher, analysts and officers say. Long-awaited improvements in body and vehicle armor have helped protect soldiers, and advances in battlefield medicine have saved many lives. New procedures, like leaving wounds open to prevent infection, and relaying soldiers to hospitals faster than ever, have kept more service members alive. Troops now carry their own tourniquets.\nDuring World War II, 30 percent of all wounded soldiers died of their injuries, a number that dipped to 24 percent during the Vietnam War and then to 9 percent for the Iraq conflict. Though this is a positive development, it also means that more soldiers are coming home with life-changing injuries, including amputations and brain trauma. More than 22,000 soldiers have been wounded in Iraq.\n''There is no question that the number of dead should have been far higher,'' said Dr. William Winkenwerder, the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, referring to the Iraqi conflict. ''Some of these blast injuries are very powerful.''\nBombs and bullets are not the only things that can kill soldiers; nearly 20 percent of those who die in Iraq do so outside of combat operations. Sometimes it is the hazard of driving too quickly on badly rutted roads to avoid danger. Humvees, weighted down with armor, can easily flip if maneuvered too quickly. Many of Iraq's roads are not built to hold heavy vehicles, and the ground can give way, tossing multi-ton machines into narrow canals where soldiers have drowned. Helicopters are sometimes strafed by sandstorms or crippled by mechanical malfunctions. Accidents make up two-thirds of the nonhostile deaths.\nWith so many soldiers carrying so many weapons, unintentional casualties occur, sometimes while handling firearms. Fire from one's own side is another inevitability of war, as is suicide. Since March 2003, 93 soldiers have died from self-inflicted wounds in Iraq.\nIn a way, these deaths, coming not at the hands of the enemy, but as a consequence of inferior roads and turbulent weather, can be even more difficult for parents to accept. Sometimes they wait months for official reports, since all noncombat deaths must be investigated.\n''I don't think I ever thought something like this could happen,'' said Shelley Burnett, whose son, Lance Cpl. Jason K. Burnett, 20, died in May after his tank toppled into a canal. ''We talked a lot about the I.E.D.'s and the dangers out there, but Jason kept saying, 'There is not a whole lot they can do to a tank.' ''\nDeath at Roadside\nOver the last two years, the Pentagon has worked frantically to harden body armor and the armor on its Humvees and other vehicles. And the insurgents in Iraq have responded just as forcefully with deadly innovations in roadside bombs, and a fury of sniper bullets.\nThe most lethal development is the use of the ''explosively formed penetrators,'' which pierce armor and stay intact when they explode. Roadside bombs are often detonated from a distance -- with garage door openers, for example -- or automatically, from pressure-sensitive devices, like a simple rubber air hose. Motion detectors and infrared devices are also used.\nThe vast majority of these bombs do not kill soldiers, or even injure them seriously. Four out of five I.E.D.'s that detonate do not cause casualties, an improvement over previous years, the Pentagon says. But those devices that do cause casualties are killing more soldiers. An analysis by The New York Times of military records found that in 2003, the devices accounted for 16 percent of troop fatalities. This year, they accounted for 43 percent. And an increasing number are killing more than one soldier.\n''Unfortunately, when there is a fatal I.E.D. attack, there often are multiple wounded and casualties,'' said Christine DeVries, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon's Joint I.E.D. Defeat Organization. ''The enemy has had some success in adapting to what we are doing.''\nLance Cpl. Jon Eric Bowman, 21, affectionate and angel-faced, was typical of many of the soldiers and marines who found their calling in the military. He was raised in rural Dubach, La., far from the razzmatazz of New Orleans, and could not wait to join after the Sept. 11 attacks.\nHe was first sent to Iraq early in 2005. When he came home later that year, he had changed. Three days before he was set to redeploy this September, he sat with his wife in their truck and talked for six hours.\n''He was crying, he was so scared,'' said his wife, Dawn Bowman, 26. ''He was having dreams that he wasn't coming back.''\nIn fact, Corporal Bowman had been having blackouts, migraines and a tic, new ailments from his time in Iraq, his wife said. The diagnosis was Tourette's syndrome, and he was then told by doctors in in Louisiana that fluid had built up in his brain.\nHe wound up back in Iraq, anyway. ''They felt he was just trying to get out of Iraq,'' said Johnny Bowman, the corporal's father, of his son's superiors. ''That there was really nothing wrong with him. That's what he told me on the phone.''\nCorporal Bowman did not push the issue, feeling guilty about abandoning his fellow marines. On Oct. 9, his Humvee ran across a roadside bomb, killing him instantly. He had been manning the machine gun.\n''Jon Eric was not just my only son,'' his father said. ''He was my best friend.''\nLance Cpl. Jeromy D. West, 20, a mortar man who loved to fish as much as he hated to study, was killed on Nov. 25 by a sniper bullet as he stood guard on a roof in Haditha. It was his second deployment.\nIn December, shortly after word of his death, his family honored his wishes and held a memorial for him on the football field at Hamilton High School, near San Diego, where he had been a star player. A thousand people showed up.\n''Everybody liked him,'' his stepfather, Ron Klopf, said. ''People would say, 'God, your son is polite.' And I would say, 'My kid?' I called him Eddie Haskell -- so polite at everybody else's house.''\nCorporal West was goofy in the best way. Not long before he joined the Marines, he and his friend would compete to see who could get a bigger freeze headache from eating too much ice cream. They would writhe in pain. Then they would do it again. He was 17 when he decided to get serious and join the corps, something his parents tried to talk him out of.\n'' 'You can get killed doing this,' '' Mr. Klopf remembers saying. ''And he said, 'Should we send some other parent's kid out there?' And that's how he was.''\nFor Corporal Burnett, death came not from bullets or bombs but from riding in a tank in a country crisscrossed with irrigation canals and crumbly roads. Just two years after graduating from high school in St. Cloud, Fla., where he spent his summers building houses for the poor and four-wheeling on back-country roads, Corporal Burnett's tank fell off a bridge and plunged into a canal, in which he drowned.\nHis mother cannot forget the day Jason and his younger brother tossed her back and forth in the yard to make her scream with laughter. ''He was a fun-loving kid,'' Mrs. Burnett said. ''If you heard laughter, you knew Jason was around.''\nOptimism was Specialist Robert F. Weber's indelible quality. A gunner from Cincinnati, he had warned his mother, Cathy, that the roads in Iraq were wretched. She worried a lot during his first deployment, particularly after he sent home a roll of film to develop. The first print she saw was of a missile hitting a barracks.\nBut he made it back to America and bought a blue Kia, the color of his eyes, before redeploying three weeks later. The Army had been a good fit. ''He was proud of himself,'' she said of Bobby, her only child. ''I was very proud. It was like he found his niche.''\nOn his second deployment, though, the situation in Iraq had become grimmer. ''Mom, things are getting worse over here, more dangerous,'' he said, from his base near Mosul the Saturday before he died. ''The roads are bad. You don't run over anything even if it looks like a piece of paper.''\nBut the lumbering armored Humvee he was on never hit a bomb on Sept. 30. It swerved somehow and flipped, killing him.\nMrs. Weber said she cannot imagine seeing the troops walk away from Iraq now, when democracy seems as unattainable as ever. ''For what did all these guys get killed over there?'' she asked, incredulously. ''What for?''\nSeven Days from Home\nBack in America, countless families and friends have waited and worried and tried their best these past years to keep themselves busy until their husbands, sons, wives, daughters, fathers, mothers or buddies returned home safely. For 3,000 of them, the reunion never came.\nIn too many cases, the homecoming was tantalizingly near, a few more X's on the calendar and the vigil would be over. A number of soldiers were killed just days and weeks from the end of their deployment, a date close enough to allow those back home to lower their guard a trifle, making the deaths all the more devastating.\n''It's almost like Christmas is here, and you wake up Christmas morning and there is no Christmas,'' said Col. Bill Rochelle, a retired National Guard commander of the 42nd Division support command.\nGunnery Sgt. John D. Fry, a 28-year-old marine from Lorena, Tex., was seven days from scooping up his wife, Malia, and his three kids into a group hug back in America. ''My plans,'' Sergeant Fry told his commander, ''are to go home and wrestle with my kids.''\nHe and Mrs. Fry were only 15 when they went on their first date, to see ''A League of Their Own,'' and then to eat ice cream at the mall. Mom and Dad drove them home. A year later, he plopped her on his lap and proposed. They kept their engagement a secret. Not long after, he was named salutatorian at Heritage Christian Academy. Another student bested him for the top title; it was the future Mrs. Fry, the valedictorian.\n''We were soul mates,'' Mrs. Fry said. On Nov. 15, 1995, five days after he graduated from boot camp, they were married.\nMr. Fry, who liked a challenge, specialized in defusing explosive devices, a nerve-racking skill he brought with him to Iraq. ''Babe,'' Mrs. Fry recalled his saying when he chose the specialty, ''it's dangerous, but I want to do it. And I said, 'Let's go.' ''\nA team leader, Sergeant Fry, who shipped out to Iraq in September 2005, disarmed 73 bombs, including one of the biggest car bombs found in Falluja. Once he helped defuse a suicide vest that insurgents had belted to a mentally handicapped Iraqi teenage boy. The boy had been beaten and chained to a wall. Another time, he spotted a bomb from the roof of a house. A little boy popped into the yard, hovering dangerously close to it. Sergeant Fry won his confidence by playing peekaboo, then got him to move away.\nHe was in ''very high spirits'' in March, calling his wife to say that his duties were done, his paperwork filed and his anticipation impossible to stifle. ''He had made it,'' she said. Then a mission came down, and commanders were preparing to send a team of mostly inexperienced men to defuse bombs along a road in Al Anbar province. He volunteered for the job, instead. ''That is how he led,'' Mrs. Fry said.\nSergeant Fry found three bombs that night and defused them. But the insurgents had hidden a fourth bomb under the third one, a booby-trap. It blew up and killed him. An Army team stayed with his body for six hours, fending off enemy fire in the dark until soldiers with mortuary affairs arrived to take his body away.\nThe war never scared him, Mrs. Fry said.\n''It was hard, but he felt he was making a difference,'' she said. ''He believed truly, that if he wasn't over there, they would be trying to harm us here.''\nEstimates of Iraqi Civilian Deaths\nUnlike the tally for American service members, no official count is available for the number of civilians killed in Iraq. Estimates based on mortuary tallies, news reports and household surveys vary widely.\nUsing figures provided by the Iraq Ministry of Health, which counts violent deaths at hospitals across the country, and Baghdad's central morgue, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq has estimated that more than 28,000 Iraqi civilians were killed during the first 10 months of 2006, a number 40 times higher than the number of American service members killed during that time.\nThe American military has criticized the civilian count as high, but it has not released statistics of its own. In its quarterly reports to Congress, the Pentagon has provided a rough estimate of the number of Iraqi civilians and security forces killed or wounded by insurgents. That number has risen sharply, to an average of more than 90 a day since last May.\nIn an off-the-cuff estimate during an official visit to Vienna in November, Iraq's health minister, Ali al-Shimari, said that 150,000 Iraqis had been killed in violence since the war began in 2003, the Associated Press has reported.\nIraq Body Count, an independent group that monitors news reports of deaths, has recorded the deaths of more than 52,000 Iraqi civilians.\nThe highest estimates of the civilian toll come from a team of researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In a study published in The Lancet, a British medical journal, they estimated 600,000 Iraqis died from violence between March 2003 and July 2006, basing their analysis on a survey of 1,849 households in 47 neighborhoods across Iraq.\nThat study was widely criticized -- the sample interviewed may not accurately represent the entire country -- but it emphasized both the difficulty of tracking deaths in a war zone and the need for a reliable count.\nIRAQI CIVILIANS KILLED\n28,000 United Nations Jan. 2006 -Oct. 2006 AMERICAN TROOPS KILLED DURING SAME TIME PERIOD: 636\n150,000 Iraqi Health Minister March 2003 - Nov. 2006 AMERICAN TROOPS KILLED DURING SAME TIME PERIOD: 2,835\n52,000 Iraq Body Count March 2003 -Dec. 2006 AMERICAN TROOPS KILLED DURING SAME TIME PERIOD: 2,879\n600,000 Johns Hopkins March 2003 -July 2006 AMERICAN TROOPS KILLED DURING SAME TIME PERIOD: 2,570\nTHE CONFLICT IN IRAQ\nCorrection: January 3, 2007, Wednesday A front-page article on Monday about American military members who have died in the Iraq war misstated the number of crewmates who survived an explosion that killed a tank driver, Specialist Jordan W.

1815836	Spitzer Arrives With Mandate, But Challenges Are Daunting	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E1D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	Eliot Laurence Spitzer takes the oath of office as New York's 54th governor in a capital desperately in need of a new moral authority figure.\nWhether or not he succeeds in fulfilling the soaring expectations that led to his landslide victory, his political timing is fortunate. After making ethical reform one of the central pledges of his campaign, Mr. Spitzer has watched from the sidelines in recent weeks as scandal has engulfed the upper reaches of state government.\n''This is a crisis that I don't want to waste,'' Mr. Spitzer said in an interview before he was sworn in early today. [Page B4.] ''If there is a result of this momentary concentration on ethical dilemmas and failures, an opportunity to galvanize support for reform, we better seize it.''\nSince the November election, Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat, has resigned and pleaded guilty to a felony. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, has revealed that federal authorities were investigating his outside consulting work. State Senator Efrain González Jr., a Democrat, has been charged with stealing more than $400,000 in state money. And a state court judge has forced a recalcitrant Legislature to reveal how it spends hundreds of millions of dollars worth of taxpayer funds on pet projects.\nIn his effort to change the culture of Albany, Mr. Spitzer said that upon taking office, he would issue ''a slew'' of executive orders ''relating to ethics, procurement and the behavior of the leadership in the agencies where a governor has unilateral control.''\nThe orders will mirror those he recently outlined for his own staff, which included a ban on gifts of more than nominal value and a prohibition on members of the executive branch from lobbying any part of the executive branch for two years after they leave their posts.\nMore daunting will be his efforts to push lawmakers to pass a number of measures early in the legislative session as he seizes on his landslide victory and the recent corruption scandals to push his agenda.\n''He has talked about redistricting reform, he's talked about campaign finance reform, he's talked about ending pay to play and he's talked overall about a transparent and accountable state government,'' said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''If he accomplishes all of that, that's probably more reform than we've seen in New York for the last 200 years.''\nMr. Spitzer is trying to reshape a state government notoriously resistant to change. Voters re-elected Mr. Hevesi as their comptroller after he admitted using state employees to chauffeur his wife. And while nearly a dozen lawmakers faced criminal charges in the last few years, many were subsequently re-elected. Mr. Spitzer will probably gain more traction from voters by delivering on his other priorities, including lowering property taxes and revitalizing the upstate economy.\nAs attorney general, Mr. Spitzer made his name by taking on Wall Street corruption as the bull market of the late 1990s unraveled and the Securities and Exchange Commission had a limited appetite for enforcement, giving him an opening to redefine his job and make himself a nationally known figure.\nBut he now must learn to work by consensus instead of by subpoena, and close watchers of the Albany scene say Mr. Spitzer must act fast so as not to lose momentum.\nStill, while reform proposals have stalled for years in the legislature, lawmakers are aware that Mr. Spitzer was elected by a record margin.\n''Right now the Legislature is on its heels,'' Mr. Horner said. ''They know the public and the new governor wants action, and I think the Legislature will want to accommodate him, but if he gets bogged down in the first session, it makes it harder to achieve the things he wants to do.''\nAlready, Senate Republicans have embraced Mr. Spitzer's proposal to delineate all spending items in the state budget, ending the practice by the Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki of writing large blank checks into the budget that they could later spend, largely in secret.\nCertainly, the new governor has a much more caffeinated style than the old one. There were titters in political circles when Mr. Pataki recently escorted a group of former Republican governors to the Broadway show ''The Drowsy Chaperone.'' The play's title echoed the criticisms frequently lobbed at Mr. Pataki -- that he has been rarely seen or heard in Albany as its problems have festered.\nMr. Spitzer has the on-the-offensive style of a former prosecutor and is well known for rattling rich and powerful cages. He made a campaign slogan of changing Albany ''on Day 1'' of his administration, but sought to set a new tone even earlier. Shortly before the election, he withdrew his endorsement of Mr. Hevesi, even though the two had been close political allies. Mr. Spitzer said that after the election he would begin adhering to a set of campaign finance guidelines far stricter than those required by state law.\nThere have been, however, some steps that have raised eyebrows, including Mr. Spitzer's appointment of a Cablevision lobbyist to be his new secretary of state. But many of his closest advisers will be veterans of the attorney general's office or of his campaign.\nIn his inaugural address, Mr. Spitzer will strive to flower his litigator's prose with rhetorical flourishes. Along those lines, he said he would ''hearken back to the great transformations New York has gone through -- the Erie Canal is everybody's favorite metaphor, and there will be some passing reference to it -- and Teddy Roosevelt's effort to bring a new ethic of governance to the capital.''\n''The theme of the inaugural speech is clearly going to be that we are turning a corner,'' he said. ''We have to think of ourselves through a different prism, both in terms of ethics and as an entire state. We have to think of ourselves as one New York and not a series of interests that are spoken to, appealed to and mollified.''\nBrass tacks will probably wait until Wednesday, when Mr. Spitzer delivers his first address to the Legislature, and until Feb. 1, when his first executive budget is due.\n''Somebody told me an inaugural is values, a State of the State is principles and the budget is the bad news,'' he said.\nThe bad news starts with the multibillion-dollar deficits projected for the state in future years.\n''The surplus we had at the end of the year is no different than an advance on a credit card bill that will come due on our next statement,'' he said. ''There is an increasing series of deficits as we proceed to Year 2, 3 and 4. The deficit increases by several billion dollars a year thereafter, and this is a consequence of prior budgets having pushed costs into the out years. That will make it tough, and tough choices have to be made.''\nBut Mr. Spitzer has some costly promises to keep, and conversely, some politically risky cuts to make. During the campaign, he outlined a complicated set of priorities, including reining in state spending to offset escalating future deficits, but also increasing spending on education and cutting by half the number of New Yorkers without health insurance.\nIn his speech, he said, he will touch on his three overarching goals.\nAt the forefront are his plans for ethical reforms, which include exploring changes to the quasi-independent public authorities that control much of the state's spending but act, as he has said, as a ''shadow government'' with little accountability.\nA second focus will be investing in the state's infrastructure, including large transportation projects like replacing the Tappan Zee Bridge and building the Second Avenue subway. He also wants the state to take a much more assertive role in creating lower-cost housing.\n''We haven't had an aggressive state housing policy for how long?'' he said. ''The state has to participate if we're going to build the housing stock we need.''\nPerhaps the most complicated part of his three-pronged agenda is his plan for economic revitalization. Reviving the economy of upstate New York, and particularly the Buffalo area, is of such concern that he split the leadership of the Empire State Development Corporation in half, with leaders for upstate and downstate. He also wants to rein in state spending overall, in part by overhauling the Medicaid system, but also by lowering property taxes and providing relief to businesses on issues like workers' compensation policies. At the same time, he wants to increase education spending by billions of dollars.\nWith so much to do, he hopes to move quickly.\n''Delay is the enemy of progress,'' he said. ''If you do not lay out the agenda early on and lay out the framework for change, we won't get there.''
1815837	STATES TAKE LEAD ON ETHICS RULES FOR LAWMAKERS	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E1D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Democrats taking over Congress this week are promising sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying laws, pledging to clean up after a spate of corruption scandals under Republican rules.\nSo far, however, their proposals are not as comprehensive or far-reaching as changes already adopted by many state legislatures.\nDemocrats in both chambers are proposing new restrictions on gifts, meals or trips paid for by lobbyists. They say they plan for the first time to require lawmakers to disclose their sponsorship of the pet items known as earmarks that they insert into major bills. House Democrats also want to require members to certify that they will not personally profit from the projects.\nSeveral states, responding to the federal scandals as well as their own statehouse imbroglios, have already adopted more sweeping gift and travel bans, broader measures to end the central role of lobbyists or government contractors in financing campaigns and new public campaign financing intended to reduce lawmakers' dependence on big donors.\nTo enforce their rules, about half the states have also created independent ethics watchdogs, outside the control of the lawmakers they police -- something federal lawmakers have so far resisted. House Democrats recently said they would create a panel to study the idea.\nJohn Hurson, a former member of the Maryland General Assembly and president of the National Council of State Legislatures, remembers marveling at the goings-on just a few miles away in the United States Capitol. He was barred from letting a lobbyist buy him a cup of coffee under rules enforced by the Maryland Ethics Commission. Meanwhile, congressmen were flying across the country for golf trips with lobbyists and enlisting them as major fund-raisers for their re-election campaigns.\n''It was amusing in a sad kind of way,'' said Mr. Hurson, who now works as a Washington lobbyist himself, for a cosmetics industry trade group. ''At the state level in Maryland a lobbyist can't even have his name on a campaign flier. And at the federal level some of these guys are basically running campaigns.''\nDemocrats say their proposals are significant first steps, especially given the customary opposition of most incumbents toward rules that would restrict their fund-raising edge. The Democrats argue that their proposals go further than anything Republicans managed to pass.\n''It is an important step forward from where we have been, let's put it that way,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat who is taking over the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and is a proponent of several more drastic changes.\nStill, some Democrats say they hope the Congress will go beyond the party leaders' current proposals. They argue that their party took control of Congress in part because of backlash against the corruption scandals under the Republicans, that many new members campaigned on ethics reform and that a failure to deliver meaningful changes could hurt the party in the 2008 elections.\nLawmakers say the Supreme Court made it difficult to regulate campaign spending by ruling in 1976, in Buckley v. Valeo, that it is a protected form of free expression.\nStates, however, are testing the limits of that decision.\nMore than a dozen states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, have enacted so-called pay-to-play laws that block contractors or executives of their companies from making campaign contributions to officials who could influence state contracts.\nConnecticut, reeling from a payoff scandal that unseated its governor, recently passed a pay-to-play law that takes aim at a time-tested tactic for evading contribution limits: funneling money through dependents. The law bans campaign contributions not only from lobbyists and contracting executives but also from their children and spouses. To make enforcement easier, lobbyists and contractors would be required to disclose the names of their family members on a public Web site. (No Congressional proposal does the same.)\nOn Tuesday, a federal district court judge in Connecticut will hear a challenge to the law.\nConnecticut has also borrowed some aspects of a decade-old Maryland law that seeks to restrict the most valuable gift that lobbyists give lawmakers: campaign fund-raising.\nAt the federal level, caps on individual or corporate campaign contributions have placed a premium on ''bundlers,'' who solicit and collect donations to turn over in bulk to a candidate's campaign.\nMany Washington lobbyists are among the biggest bundlers, and even help run re-election campaigns.\nAcross the District of Columbia border in Maryland, state law bars lobbyists from soliciting contributions for candidates or playing any roles in the campaigns.\n''Lobbyists can no longer be the center of the fund-raising process,'' Mr. Van Hollen of Maryland said.\nMr. Van Hollen said he planned to introduce a measure requiring federal lobbyists to disclose whom they ask for the contributions that they bundle and how much those people give. A similar measure was deleted from a bill by the Republican leadership before it reached the floor.\nStates are also adopting new forms of public campaign financing.\nCongressional candidates receive no public financing, and there is no limit on what they can spend. And the public financing system adopted for presidential campaigns after the Watergate scandal is on the brink of obsolescence. For the first time in three decades, the major 2008 presidential candidates are expected to reject the system in favor of raising unlimited private funds.\nSeveral states, however, are expanding the idea. Maryland and New Jersey are among those considering a system enacted in Arizona and Maine. The new Connecticut law includes a modified form of the idea, known as ''clean elections.''\nParticipating candidates who get a certain amount of small contributions -- as low as $5 in some places -- receive large lump sums of public campaign money early in the race if they agree not to raise or spend private funds. And, up to a limit, the state pledges to give participating candidates enough money to match the campaign spending of any rival candidate outside the system.\nNo state, of course, has eradicated the influence of money. In Maryland, for example, lobbyists cannot take individual lawmakers to dinner but can treat whole legislative committees, a rule lobbyists say favors the well-financed. Even so, some Annapolis lobbyists appreciate the fund-raising ban.\n''Legislators can call and say they need your help,'' said Minor Carter, a Republican lobbyist. ''And you have the absolute defense of saying, 'I'm sorry, I can't.' ''
1815838	U.S. QUESTIONED IRAQ ON THE RUSH TO HANG HUSSEIN	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E1D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	With his plain pine coffin strapped into an American military helicopter for a predawn journey across the desert, Saddam Hussein, the executed dictator who built a legend with his defiance of America, completed a turbulent passage into history on Sunday.\nLike the helicopter trip, just about everything in the 24 hours that began with Mr. Hussein's being taken to his execution from his cell in an American military detention center in the postmidnight chill of Saturday had a surreal and even cinematic quality.\nPart of it was that the Americans, who turned him into a pariah and drove him from power, proved to be his unlikely benefactors in the face of Iraq's new Shiite rulers who seemed bent on turning the execution and its aftermath into a new nightmare for the Sunni minority privileged under Mr. Hussein. [Page A7.]\nThe 110-mile journey aboard a Black Hawk helicopter carried Mr. Hussein's body to an American military base north of Tikrit, Camp Speicher, named for an American Navy pilot lost over Iraq in the first hours of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. From there, an Iraqi convoy carried him to Awja, the humble town beside the Tigris River that Mr. Hussein, in the chandeliered palaces that became his habitat as ruler, spoke of as emblematic of the miseries of his lonely and impoverished youth.\nThe American role extended beyond providing the helicopter that carried Mr. Hussein home. Iraqi and American officials who have discussed the intrigue and confusion that preceded the decision late on Friday to rush Mr. Hussein to the gallows have said that it was the Americans who questioned the political wisdom -- and justice -- of expediting the execution, in ways that required Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to override constitutional and religious precepts that might have assured Mr. Hussein a more dignified passage to his end.\nThe Americans' concerns seem certain to have been heightened by what happened at the hanging, as evidenced in video recordings made just before Mr. Hussein fell through the gallows trapdoor at 6:10 a.m. on Saturday. A new video that appeared on the Internet late Saturday, apparently made by a witness with a camera cellphone, underscored the unruly, mocking atmosphere in the execution chamber.\nThis continued, on the video, through the actual hanging itself, with a shout of ''The tyrant has fallen! May God curse him!'' as Mr. Hussein hung lifeless, his neck snapped back and his glassy eyes open.\nThe cacophony from those gathered before the gallows included a shout of ''Go to hell!'' as the former ruler stood with the noose around his neck in the final moments, and his riposte, barely audible above the bedlam, which included the words ''gallows of shame.'' It continued despite appeals from an official-sounding voice, possibly Munir Haddad, the judge who presided at the hanging, saying, ''Please no! The man is about to die.''\nThe Shiites who predominated at the hanging began a refrain at one point of ''Moktada! Moktada! Moktada!''-- the name of a volatile cleric whose private militia has spawned death squads that have made an indiscriminate industry of killing Sunnis -- appending it to a Muslim imprecation for blessings on the Prophet Muhammad. ''Moktada,'' Mr. Hussein replied, smiling contemptuously. ''Is this how real men behave?''\nAmerican officials in Iraq have been reluctant to say much publicly about the pell-mell nature of the hanging, apparently fearful of provoking recriminations in Washington, where the Bush administration adopted a hands-off posture, saying the timing of the execution was Iraq's to decide.\nWhile privately incensed at the dead-of-night rush to the gallows, the Americans here have been caught in the double bind that has ensnared them over much else about the Maliki government -- frustrated at what they call the government's failure to recognize its destructive behavior, but reluctant to speak out, or sometimes to act, for fear of undermining Mr. Maliki and worsening the situation.\nBut a narrative assembled from accounts by various American officials, and by Iraqis present at some of the crucial meetings between the two sides, shows that it was the Americans who counseled caution in the way the Iraqis carried out the hanging. The issues uppermost in the Americans' minds, these officials said, were a provision in Iraq's new Constitution that required the three-man presidency council to approve hangings, and a stipulation in a longstanding Iraqi law that no executions can be carried out during the Id al-Adha holiday, which began for Iraqi Sunnis on Saturday and Shiites on Sunday.\nA senior Iraqi official said the Americans staked out their ground at a meeting on Thursday, 48 hours after an appeals court had upheld the death sentence passed on Mr. Hussein and two associates. They were convicted in November of crimes against humanity for the persecution of the Shiite townspeople of Dujail, north of Baghdad, in 1982. Mr. Hussein, as president, signed a decree to hang 148 men and teenage boys.\nTold that Mr. Maliki wanted to carry out the death sentence on Mr. Hussein almost immediately, and not wait further into the 30-day deadline set by the appeals court, American officers at the Thursday meeting said that they would accept any decision but needed assurance that due process had been followed before relinquishing physical custody of Mr. Hussein.\n''The Americans said that we have no issue in handing him over, but we need everything to be in accordance with the law,'' the Iraqi official said. ''We do not want to break the law.''\nThe American pressure sent Mr. Maliki and his aides into a frantic quest for legal workarounds, the Iraqi official said. The Americans told them they needed a decree from President Jalal Talabani, signed jointly by his two vice presidents, upholding the death sentence, and a letter from the chief judge of the Iraqi High Tribunal, the court that tried Mr. Hussein, certifying the verdict. But Mr. Talabani, a Kurd, made it known that he objected to the death penalty on principle.\nThe Maliki government spent much of Friday working on legal mechanisms to meet the American demands. From Mr. Talabani, they obtained a letter saying that while he would not sign a decree approving the hanging, he had no objections. The Iraqi official said Mr. Talabani first asked the tribunal's judges for an opinion on whether the constitutional requirement for presidential approval applied to a death sentence handed down by the tribunal, a special court operating outside Iraq's main judicial system. The judges said the requirement was void.\nMr. Maliki had one major obstacle: the Hussein-era law proscribing executions during the Id holiday. This remained unresolved until late Friday, the Iraqi official said. He said he attended a late-night dinner at the prime minister's office at which American officers and Mr. Maliki's officials debated the issue.\nOne participant described the meeting this way: ''The Iraqis seemed quite frustrated, saying, 'Who is going to execute him, anyway, you or us?' The Americans replied by saying that obviously, it was the Iraqis who would carry out the hanging. So the Iraqis said, 'This is our problem and we will handle the consequences. If there is any damage done, it is we who will be damaged, not you.' ''\nTo this, the Iraqis added what has often been their trump card in tricky political situations: they telephoned officials of the marjaiya, thesupreme religious body in Iraqi Shiism, composed of ayatollahs in the holy city of Najaf. The ayatollahs approved. Mr. Maliki, at a few minutes before midnight on Friday, then signed a letter to the justice minister, ''to carry out the hanging until death.''\nThe Maliki letter sent Iraqi and American officials into a frenzy of activity. Fourteen Iraqi officials, including senior members of the Maliki government, were called at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday and told to gather at the prime minister's office. At. 3:30 a.m., they were driven to the helicopter pad beside Mr. Hussein's old Republican Palace, and taken to the prison in the northern suburb of Khadimiya where the hanging took place.\nAt about the same time, American and Iraqi officials said, Mr. Hussein was roused at his Camp Cropper cell 10 miles away, and taken to a Black Hawk helicopter for his journey to Khadimiya.\nNone of the Iraqi officials were able to explain why Mr. Maliki had been unwilling to allow the execution to wait. Nor would any explain why those who conducted it had allowed it to deteriorate into a sectarian free-for-all that had the effect, on the video recordings, of making Mr. Hussein, a mass murderer, appear dignified and restrained, and his executioners, representing Shiites who were his principal victims, seem like bullying street thugs.\nBut the explanation may have lain in something that Bassam al-Husseini, a Maliki aide closely involved in arrangements for the hanging, said to the BBC later. Mr. Husseini, who has American citizenship, described the hanging as ''an Id gift to the Iraqi people.''\nThe weekend's final disorderly chapter came with the tensions over Mr. Hussein's body. For nearly 18 hours on Saturday, Mr. Maliki's officials insisted that his corpse would be kept in secret government custody until circumstances allowed interment without his grave becoming a shrine or a target. Once again, the Americans intervened.\nThe leader of Mr. Hussein's Albu-Nasir tribe, Sheik Ali al-Nida, said that before flying to Baghdad on an American helicopter, he had been so fearful for his safety that he had written a will. Bizarrely, Sheik Nida and others were shown on Iraqi television collecting the coffin from the courtyard in front of Mr. Maliki's office, where it sat unceremoniously in a police pickup.\nAfter the helicopter trip to Camp Speicher, the American base outside Tikrit, the coffin was taken in an Iraqi convoy to Awja, and laid to rest in the ornate visitors' center that Mr. Hussein ordered built for the townspeople in the 1990s. Local officials and members of Mr. Hussein's tribe had broken open the marbled floor in the main reception hall, and cleared what they said would be a temporary burial place until he could be moved to a permanent grave outside Awja where his two sons, Uday and Qusay, are buried.\nAt the burial, several mourners threw themselves on the closed casket. One, a young man convulsed with sobs, cried: ''He has not died. I can hear him speaking to me.'' Another shouted, ''Saddam is dead! Instead of weeping for him, think of ways we can take revenge on the Iranian enemy,'' Sunni parlance for the Shiites now in power.\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ
1815839	In Los Angeles, Trying to Atone For Water Sins	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E1D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	It may fall short of a feel-good sequel to ''Chinatown,'' the movie based on the notorious, somewhat shady water grab by Los Angeles that allowed the city to bloom from a semi-arid desert.\nBut in one of the largest river restoration efforts in the West, water is again flowing along a 62-mile stretch of the Owens River after a dry spell of nearly a century.\nThat part of the river had been left mostly drained when upstream water, fed by snowmelt from the towering Sierra Nevada, was channeled 233 miles south to fill swimming pools and bathtubs throughout Los Angeles.\nThe restored flow is among several long-awaited steps the city is taking to help make amends for the environmental consequences of its water maneuvering, most notably the drying up of Owens Lake, an area more than three times the size of Manhattan, here in the Owens Valley.\nLos Angeles agreed in December to expand efforts to control toxic dust storms that erupt from what is left of the lake, a 110-square-mile body that emptied when the river was diverted to Los Angeles through an aqueduct opened in 1913.\nThe lake's salty, mineral-laced basin has been the largest single source of particulate pollution in the country. It looks so otherworldly that it doubled as a desolate planet in the movie ''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.''\nTo restore the river, Los Angeles built automated gates at the point where the river veers into the aqueduct. The gates steer some water into the original riverbed, setting the stage for the growth of cottonwood trees and other plants and the return of waterfowl and other animals.\nMuch of the water eventually returns to the aqueduct, though some of it is being used for lake irrigation and other projects.\nEnvironmentalists here say they are keeping an eye on Los Angeles for backsliding, but they acknowledge that the new efforts will make a significant difference.\nAs winds whipped across Owens Lake on a recent afternoon, Mike Prather of the Owens Valley Committee, which along with the Sierra Club took Los Angeles to court over the environmental fallout of its water policies, marveled at sandpipers, American avocets and other birds frolicking in the shallow pools created by the irrigation.\n''This work will bring back more and more of them,'' Mr. Prather said, savoring the twist in the battle that means water once intended for Los Angeles will feed the lake.\n''It's Owens Valley's turn to stick its straw in L.A.'s water,'' he said.\nCourt rulings and the threat of legal action have largely forced Los Angeles's hand in dealing with its past water moves, but city leaders say they are also intent on doing the right thing in keeping up a vital source of water while avoiding further damage to the Owens Valley.\nH. David Nahai, president of the board that oversees the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said Los Angeles was looking for less adversarial ways to resolve differences over the valley, which provides 40 percent to 60 percent of the city's water supply, depending on the snowfall in the mountains.\n''We can't change the past, but we can shape the future,'' said Mr. Nahai, one of five board members appointed by Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa, who promised a friendlier approach to the valley when he took office in July 2005.\nSusan Cash, the chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors of Inyo County, where the Owens Valley is located, said animosity toward Los Angeles had lessened since the early 20th century, when the water diversion was made possible by the purchase of much of the valley by less-than-forthcoming city operatives.\nThe underhanded moves, as chronicled by historians, included city representatives posing as ranchers as they bought up property. The questionable land dealing provided the inspiration for ''Chinatown,'' the 1974 movie starring Jack Nicholson as a private detective who stumbles across corruption on a Los Angeles water project.\nWater from the valley made possible the growth of what became the nation's second-largest city. But people in the valley have long regarded the water dealings as a double-edged sword.\nOfficials here have argued that the water diversion undercut the potential for growth. But others say that such prospects were dim anyway in such a dry and remote valley, and that Los Angeles's keeping the water clean and the land relatively untouched has been a boon.\nLos Angeles's policy of allowing public access to much of its land and the fact that many people here have worked for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, one of the valley's largest employers, or have friends or relatives there, have contributed to improved relations. The godfathers of Ms. Cash's children worked for the department.\n''The fact is,'' she said, ''we are in a marriage with no annulment in the near future, so we have to find a way to work together.''\nInyo officials said the city's projects could inspire more tourism, the only real economic activity in this dry, high-desert valley.\n''We have recreational users now but not to the extent it can be once the river is flowing and there is sufficient water for fish and wildlife,'' said Arlene Grider, president of the chamber of commerce here.\nThe long-promised river restoration is a $24 million project, compensation won from a lawsuit by environmental groups over excessive groundwater pumping. It came after delays that prompted a county judge in September 2005 to impose daily fines of $5,000 on Los Angeles. The penalty has so far cost the city $2.3 million and will continue until a large volume of water flows through the river in the coming months.\nThe work on the lake, scheduled to be completed by 2010, will irrigate or otherwise control dust over 43 square miles.\nThe improvements result from an agreement the city signed with the local air pollution control regulator in 1998 that sets a timetable to comply with federal requirements to control dust on the lake. The city has spent $400 million on dust control for just under 30 square miles of the worst pockets, and in December, through a mediator, it agreed to do 12.7 more square miles by 2010 at a cost of $105 million.\nA water department spokeswoman in Los Angeles, Carol Tucker, said ratepayers would see relatively modest increases in their monthly bills; the river restoration, for example, would amount to an increase of about 26 cents. Los Angeles has one of the country's more intensive conservation programs, allowing it to use roughly the same amount of water even as it has grown by 750,000 residents in the past two decades.\nBut environmentalists say they doubt the city can grow much more without finding more water.\nMr. Nahai said the Department of Water and Power was already studying other possibilities, like using groundwater from within Los Angeles, buying water from other places and desalinating ocean water.\nBut one thing is certain, he said: ''Are we going to get to a place where we are going to pump all the water out? No.''\nStill, most everyone suggests there could be rough going ahead. Ms. Cash, the Inyo County supervisor, said officials were only ''cautiously optimistic'' about a changed relationship with Los Angeles because they had heard nice words from the city before, only to end up in court.\nMr. Nahai acknowledged that the litigious nature of the relationship would be difficult to break.\n''Nobody can guarantee there won't be litigation in the future, and litigation has its uses,'' he said. ''There is no denying what the City of Los Angeles has done far too often has been because of court order.''\nHe added, ''It's like what Mark Twain said: 'Whiskey is for drinking, and water is for fighting over.'

1815841	Amid Champagne and Cheers, Spitzer Is Sworn In as Governor	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE1D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	With his wife, his children and his parents looking on, Eliot Laurence Spitzer was officially sworn in at midnight as the 54th governor of New York State during a private ceremony here at the governor's mansion.\nStanding by a fireplace, Mr. Spitzer placed his hand on a Bible and repeated the oath of office, in a very loud and clear voice: ''I, Eliot Spitzer, do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the governor of the State of New York according to the best of my abilities, so help me God.''\nA cheer rose from the guests: ''Go get 'em, Eliot!''\nAnd with those words, New York's Democrats reclaimed the governor's office after 12 years of Republican rule, and Mr. Spitzer, 47, ascended to a historic office that has been held by Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt, Alfred E. Smith, Thomas E. Dewey and Hugh L. Carey, who was present.\nA more festive public inauguration ceremony with pomp, circumstance, food and music is scheduled to be held Monday afternoon, but Mr. Spitzer needed to take the oath of office by midnight in order to ensure the smooth transition of government as he took over from Gov. George E. Pataki, whose 12-year term ended at midnight.\nMr. Spitzer was sworn in by Judge Robert W. Sweet, the Federal District Court judge who gave Mr. Spitzer his start in public service, hiring him as a clerk in 1984 after his graduation from Harvard Law School.\nWith the new governor were his wife, Silda Wall Spitzer; his daughters, Elyssa, 17, Sarabeth, 14, and Jenna, 12; his parents, Bernard and Anne Spitzer; and dozens of political figures and family friends.\nThe party was not without drama.\nLloyd Constantine -- Mr. Spitzer's friend, tennis partner, onetime law partner and co-chairman of his transition team -- continued his tradition of buying Champagne for a Spitzer oath of office. The bottles seem to grow in size with the job. As Ms. Wall Spitzer put it, ''The bottles just keep getting bigger.''\nThis time Mr. Constantine went for a 12-liter bottle of Veuve Clicquot called a balthazar. But opening it did not prove easy -- the Champagne did not flow until Mr. Constantine attacked the giant bottle with a wrench, enlisted the help of another guest, and eventually broke the lip of the bottle, cutting his hand, and waving the bloody hand in triumph. Asked if it was worth it, he said, ''Yeah, sure.''\nThe public festivities later Monday were to feature New York State wines from Long Island, the Hudson Valley and the Finger Lakes, as well as regional specialties like Guss's pickles, Junior's cheesecake and Buffalo wings from the Anchor Bar in Buffalo.\nThere was some trepidation about the weather forecast, though. Mr. Spitzer, who spoke about the value of optimism during the campaign, planned an outdoor inaugural for New Year's Day in Albany (and a 6 a.m. run through Washington Park). But with light rain falling, and freezing rain forecast, most of the inaugural events were pushed back an hour in the hopes that the bad weather would move through.
1815842	Rell Is Primed To Pursue Her Agenda	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	As she wrote her first inaugural speech, M. Jodi Rell turned to the remarks of Gerald R. Ford. Like the former president who took over after the resignation of Richard M. Nixon, Governor Rell was looking for a way to soothe nerves, not make waves.\nShe was sworn in on a hot day in July 2004 after the abrupt resignation of Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican who would be sentenced to a year in federal prison on corruption charges. ''People were so disappointed, they were so disillusioned, they had just lost faith,'' Ms. Rell said, apparently referring to both her own situation and President Ford's. ''They just needed somebody to say it's going to be O.K. and we are going to get past this.''\nNow, with Mr. Ford's death coinciding with Ms. Rell's preparation for her first full term, she said her role as the state's leader had evolved. She was no longer the accidental governor.\n''After the election, it just felt like coming back to work. Nothing really changed,'' Ms. Rell, a Republican who swept 63 percent of the vote in November, said in a recent interview at the Capitol here. ''But it's only in the last week or so where it's hit me -- this is different. The expectations and the new session gives you pause to say all right, this is what we are going to do. This is my agenda.''\nExtremely popular and perceived as honest and calm, Ms. Rell is just now beginning to form her own cabinet, dismissing nearly all of Mr. Rowland's top assistants.\nAfter two years largely characterized by initiatives to ''right the ship'' in a state crippled by corrupt politicians, Ms. Rell, who will be sworn in on Wednesday, now must attack more complex problems, such as soaring health care and energy costs. And though she was one of only a handful of Republicans in the Northeast who managed to retain a top office this election season, Ms. Rell faces a veto-proof Democratic majority in both chambers of the General Assembly.\nThe dominance of Democrats could certainly hobble Ms. Rell's plans to cut taxes. Already, she has compromised one of her signature ideas: after legislative leaders indicated they would block her efforts to cut the car tax, Ms. Rell dropped the subject, saying she would choose her battles carefully.\n''I think we are approaching a time where we have to come up with some really creative solutions, and if the governor can't get there it is possible the honeymoon would be over,'' said Donald E. Williams Jr., leader of the Democrats in the State Senate.\nBut for all the chatter in political circles of their party's new power, Mr. Williams and other Democrats speak of the Republican governor in tones usually reserved for one of their own.\n''I don't think anyone is looking for unnecessary fights,'' Senator Williams said. ''The governor has sealed her popularity among voters and made people feel extremely comfortable.''\nConfrontation and flashy speech are not Ms. Rell's style. Elected to the State House of Representatives in 1984, she earned a reputation for dealing with mundane details, picking apart legislation and knowing precisely where there was room for compromise.\nThat approach helped lead to a sense of Ms. Rell, 60, as a maternal figure, something that has stuck through her term in executive office. Some Democrats remark privately that when the governor admonishes them to kill or push through a bill, it is like being scolded by their mother.\nMs. Rell cultivates that image: In a season of brutal campaign attack advertisements, one of her commercials featured the governor sitting in a chair with her grandson. A public service announcement encouraging drivers not to drink and drive has Ms. Rell on a playground surrounded by children.\nAnd when she released a health care proposal last week, half a dozen children sat on either side waving to the television cameras. Peering out at the audience over her bifocals, Ms. Rell resembled a teacher reading the lesson of the day.\nMs. Rell and her supporters have always been happy to acknowledge that she was an unlikely candidate to become the state's top political figure. A former homemaker who dropped out of college, Ms. Rell earned her political education on the job, working her way up to become minority leader of the House before being tapped by Mr. Rowland to run for lieutenant governor.\nThe two were never particularly close, and Ms. Rell maintains that she had no clue about Mr. Rowland's wrongdoings, something that infuriates opponents trying to tie her to the corrupt administration.\nSuch criticisms have somehow yet to stick. Even when Ms. Rell's chief of staff became embroiled in controversy for distributing invitations to a political fund-raiser on state time last year, voters consistently told pollsters they trusted the Rell administration.\nSome people in both parties complain that Governor Rell has done little to articulate or push her own agenda, instead favoring policies typically backed by Democrats such as stem-cell research or civil unions for same-sex couples. Others see that as her strength.\n''You hear Democrats claim: 'She hasn't done anything, she hasn't done anything,' '' said Chris Barnes, a pollster at the University of Connecticut. ''Well, the last governor did something and the something was lining his pockets. People are quite happy this governor is not doing that something.''\nInstead, Ms. Rell has wisely been ''adjusting the course rather that setting it,'' Mr. Barnes said. ''People were not begging for grandiose plans. They just want the government not to mess things up.''\nSuch a modest goal aptly sums up the governing philosophy of Ms. Rell, who describes herself a steadfast moderate who believes in ''less government, less intrusive government, and less spending whenever possible.''\nHer biggest fights with the Legislature will likely be over the budget, which Ms. Rell will present in February, and taxes.\nAlso, Democrats plan to making universal health care a top priority, while Ms. Rell last week offered a far more limited proposal than what Democrats envision.\nMs. Rell opened the health care bidding last week with a plan to let uninsured adult residents buy into a pool with a premium of $250 a month. Emphasizing that she would not support a ''big government'' subsidy, Ms. Rell said the cost of the plan to the state would be minimal.\nAfter decades in public office, Ms. Rell can still appear wary of the spotlight, blushing at the slightest embarrassment or standing at the back of a crowd -- and she guards her privacy.\nWhen she had a mastectomy to remove breast cancer two days after Christmas in 2004, her assistants did not announce the operation until she was already at the hospital and asked well-wishers not to send flowers.\nThere are signs of increasing comfort with the pageantry; on Wednesday, Ms. Rell will lead the first inaugural parade and ball the state has had in more than a decade (though she turned down a society reporter's request to photograph her off-white ball gown last week).\n''I think you're going to see more and more of her,'' said Robert Farr, an ally of Ms. Rell who recently retired from the General Assembly. ''A year ago she was the governor by accident, but she can clearly be the real thing now.\n''She is not going to be one rushing for press conferences,'' Mr. Farr added. ''She is not one to go out and state a political position every day. But when she stakes something out, she is going to present something that can give measurable results.''\nFor her part, Ms. Rell said she is still drawing inspiration from the former president she looked to the first time she took the oath of office.\n''Gerald Ford was not flashy,'' she said, her voice softening. ''He wanted to talk to people. And I know that's what I want. I want people to feel comfortable. I want them to see a governor up close.''
1815843	Overall Crime in New York Fell 5 Percent in 2006, but Homicides Increased	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E0D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	In New York City, rapes, robberies and assaults, among other crimes, continued to decline last year, prompting the Police Department's top official to herald 2006 as a very good year. Homicides, however, climbed 10 percent in the city, reversing a much-hailed decrease.\n''We'd like to see no homicides. The reality is we're going to have them,'' said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. ''I think this is a very good year.''\nHe called the increase in killings in 2006 all but negligible compared with 1990, a year with one of the highest homicide rates in recent history. That year, crack-fueled violence soared, and 2,262 people were killed.\nLast year there were 579 killings citywide as of Dec. 24, an increase of 52 homicides over the same period in 2005. Yet overall crime last year was down 5 percent. The number of reported rapes declined by 7.4 percent to 1,486, subway crime plunged 13 percent and auto theft fell 11.4 percent.\nThe police said the year's jump in homicides was rooted largely in an unusually high number of ''reclassified'' deaths, deaths linked to injuries incurred in months or years past. There were 38 reclassified homicides in New York last year, compared with 21 in 2005.\nNew York's overall fall in crime also contrasts with an increase nationwide. According to a report by the F.B.I., violent crime across the country rose 3.7 percent during the first half of the year. Dallas remained the country's most violent city, with 3,985 crimes per 100,000 people, according to the midyear report, while New York ranked 10th with 1,1,87 per 100,000.\nMyriad factors account for New York's continuing decline in crime overall, the police and criminologists say. They cited more effective policing, shifting drug patterns and the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years.\nYet what is puzzling, one expert said, is that overall crime is dropping even as New York becomes an increasingly polarized city, with haves and have-nots often living side by side in luxury condominiums and public housing.\n''Within a few blocks, people are living worlds apart,'' said Andrew Karmen, a sociology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the author of ''New York Murder Mystery: The True Story Behind the Crime Crash of the 1990s.''\n''In theory, that should make the poor more dissatisfied and drive people to commit crimes,'' he said. ''But that doesn't seem to be happening in New York.''\nOne possible explanation, Dr. Karmen said, is that the city is largely populated by immigrants, many of whom are driven by a determination to succeed.\n''I think they still maintain a positive outlook and faith in the American dream,'' he said. ''But if it doesn't deliver, attitudes could change.''\nIt has proven difficult to root out violent crime in the city's toughest corners.\nOne of the city's most perilous neighborhoods is in the 75th Precinct in Brooklyn, which includes East New York. There the number of slayings last year was virtually unchanged from 2005 at 28, and 3,239 crimes were reported.\nPublic housing projects have a disproportionate number of crimes. While 5 percent of New York's eight million residents live in public housing, Commissioner Kelly said, 16 percent of the city's homicides take place there.\nThe Police Department plans to tackle that seemingly intractable problem by redeploying personnel from other areas and opening police substations in the most troubled housing complexes, Commissioner Kelly said.\nBoth homicide victims and suspects tend to have links to crime already, he said.\nOf those arrested last year in homicides, 95 percent had criminal histories; 75 percent of the people killed did.\nSuch figures point to the department's need to continue expanding its homicide, shooting and crime databases, Mr. Kelly said.\n''The more information we have, the greater the potential we have to prevent crimes,'' he said.\nNew York's rebirth as a safer-than-average large city since the 1990s has coincided with an increase in tourism here.\nAccording to city officials, about 44 million people visited last year on business or pleasure.\n''One overarching reason why people are coming here, in a city that was attacked five years ago, it's because they have a sense of comfort as far as security is concerned,'' Mr. Kelly said.\nThe department is continuing to pour more resources into community policing, forging bonds between its officials and local leaders, especially those from new immigrant communities.\nYet in neighborhoods where homicide rates climbed, residents seem divided about whether this recent and heightened focus was improving their lives.\nAllah B, the director of the Allah in Mecca Youth Center in Harlem, commended officers in its precinct, the 28th, for holding local forums and listening to community concerns.\nEven though slayings in the precinct more than doubled, to 11, last year, he said the increased connection between residents and the police fostered a greater sense of ease.\nYet a longtime resident of the St. Nicholas Homes in Harlem said police efforts to rout out criminals were having a divisive effect in her neighborhood.\n''They caused a lot of trouble trying to play one person against the other,'' said the woman, who would give only her first name, Keisha. She said people in the neighborhood also felt harassed and persecuted by the police, and that such impressions heightened the tension and stress in the community.\nStill, despite a slight increase in the number of homicides in her neighborhood, she said the streets felt far less violent than in previous years.\nThe sense that New Yorkers are increasingly inhabiting two different realities seems particularly strong in places like Fort Greene, Brooklyn, home to a thriving cafe scene and crime-plagued public housing complexes.\nEleven homicides were recorded in the neighborhood last year, compared with none in 2005.\nStrolling along a stretch of DeKalb Avenue by Fort Greene Park late last week, Cheryl Pickett, 36, said she had no idea that murders had risen so sharply in the area.\nMs. Pickett, who has lived in Fort Greene for five years, said her perception of the neighborhood had not changed. She still thinks of it as a safe, child-friendly place with charming shops and bars.\n''When things happen, it's really surprising,'' Ms. Pickett said. ''This year seems no different than last.''
1815844	Somali Clan Elders Urge Islamists to Leave Stronghold	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E0D71630F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	As fighting began to flare Sunday around Kismayo, in southern Somalia, the final redoubt for the country's diminished Islamic movement, elders within the city demanded that the Islamists go.\nMuhammad Arab, a leader of the Ogaden subclan, said 36 elders of various clans and subclans met over the weekend with Islamist leaders and tried to persuade them that resistance against the huge Ethiopian-backed force heading toward them was futile.\n''We told them that they were going to lose,'' Mr. Arab said, ''and that our city would get destroyed.''\nKismayo, a scenic harbor town along the Indian Ocean that was once part of the East African spice empire, has been spared the fighting so far. But the Islamists, Mr. Arab said, did not care. ''These guys are bent on war,'' he said.\nThe fighting started around 5 p.m., with the Ethiopian-backed forces unleashing an artillery barrage against Islamist troops dug in near Jilib, a town about 30 miles north of Kismayo.\n[Residents of Kismayo told Reuters Monday that Somali Islamists fled overnight from their final stronghold around the southern port of the city. Several thousand Somalia Islamic Courts Council fighters had been making a last stand north of Kismayo port, but residents said they melted away after the advancing Ethiopian force began its shelling of Jilib. Somalia's interim government vowed to pursue them.]\nAs the shells began to rain down in Jilib, residents said, clan militias in Kismayo turned on the Islamists.\nThat set off running gun battles across the city, with several people reported killed. It also accelerated the exodus from Kismayo, with thousands of residents hastily gathering a few belongings and joining the stream of people fleeing the fighting in southern Somalia.\nIt is hard to predict what is going to happen next. Local support for the Islamists in Kismayo is obviously evaporating, just as it did last week in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, when clan elders decided that the Islamists were a losing cause and pulled their troops and weapons out of the movement.\nThat led to the city falling much faster than anyone expected into the hands of Somalia's transitional government, which has used Ethiopian troops and airpower to reclaim much of the country. Clan elders are the pillars of Somali society, and many of the Islamist fighters in Mogadishu were clan militiamen lent to the movement.\nBut the fighters in Kismayo may be different. Kismayo is where the Islamist leadership fled after losing Mogadishu, taking their most steadfast and hard-core fighters.\nEthiopian officials have said that the Somali Islamists are bolstered by several thousand foreign fighters -- from Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, Libya and Eritrea, Ethiopia's bitter enemy, though American intelligence officials have said that the numbers are far fewer, most likely in the hundreds.\nDiplomats are still searching for a way to avert disaster. On Sunday, Kenyan officials, with American encouragement, continued to meet in Nairobi with the few remaining moderate leaders of the Islamist movement in an effort to reach a cease-fire. But the talks were slow-going, said an official close to the parties.\nIn Mogadishu, the transitional prime minister, Ali Mohammed Gedi, seems to relish his newfound authority. Mr. Gedi, a bookish veterinarian whom few Somalis would have recognized before last week's stunning comeback by the transitional government, is holding daily news conferences, meeting with clan elders and surveying bombed-out buildings for future office space. On Sunday, he reassured the populace in confident tones that the era of warlord rule was over.

The driver who died was identified as John Southern, 35, of South Jamaica, Queens. The second driver, Edwin Washington, 22, of Jamaica, was charged with criminally negligent homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving, the police said. The two men were racing about 5:30 p.m. on Saturday along North Conduit Avenue near 78th Street in Jamaica when Mr. Southern's white Mitsubishi Galant overturned, the police said. A passenger in Mr. Southern's car, Cory Sapp, 18, of Queens, was also arrested and charged, after police officers found a gun in the Galant, the police said.\nMICHAEL WILSON

Two of the three men in the injured passenger's vehicle, a GMC Yukon, and a passing off-duty police officer, Michael Leone, caught up with the driver, the police said. The collision occurred shortly before 6 a.m. on the eastbound lanes of the expressway at 69th Street in Maspeth, Queens, the police said. The man's sport utility vehicle veered into the GMC Yukon, pushing it onto the shoulder, the police said. The badly injured passenger, a woman who was in the back seat, was said to be in critical condition yesterday evening at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. All three men in the Yukon suffered minor injuries. The driver of the first vehicle, Alexie Quiles, 26, was charged with vehicular assault and driving while intoxicated, the police said. He was also charged with illegal possession of a weapon after officers found a gun in his vehicle, the police said.\nMICHAEL WILSON

1815849	Islamists Abandon Final Stronghold in Somalia	2007-01-01	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E5DD1130F932A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Islamist forces in Somalia abandoned their final stronghold Monday morning, fleeing the port city of Kismayo much like they had fled Mogadishu, the capital, last week.\nIn the face of an intense artillery barrage by Ethiopian-backed forces and thousands of well-equipped troops heading their way, the Islamists scattered, with some of their militia shedding their uniforms and melting back into the population while others headed south towards a thickly forested area along the Kenya border.\n''I can't tell you how happy people were that they disappeared,'' Adam Ragay, a businessman in Kismayo, said today.\nAs soon as the Islamists left, looters rushed into the streets and smashed up stores and ran away with TVs and mobile phones. But by mid-afternoon, the brief burst of anarchy was over and transitional government troops had arrived on the outskirts of town.\n''I can confirm to you that our forces have captured Kismayo,'' Somalia's transitional prime minister, Ali Mohamed Gedi, told The Associated Press today.\nThis leaves the transitional government of Somalia now in control of every major town in south-central Somalia, though there are fears the war may not be over and that the Islamists are simply switching to underground guerilla tactics. It took the transitional government, with the help of the Ethiopian military, one of the most powerful in Africa, all of one week to rout the Islamists.\nResidents of Kismayo said the remaining Islamists were heading toward Ras Kamboni, a small town on the Kenyan border which western intelligence officers say has been used as a terrorist hide-out before.\nKenya officials have said that they have increased security on the border to keep the Islamists from escaping through Kenya.\nAs fighting began to flare up on Sunday around Kismayo, elders within the city demanded that the Islamists go.\nMuhammad Arab, a leader of the Ogaden subclan, said that 36 elders of various clans and subclans met over the weekend with Islamist leaders and tried to persuade them that resistance against the huge Ethiopian-backed force heading toward them was futile.\n''We told them that they were going to lose,'' Mr. Arab said, ''and that our city would get destroyed.''\nKismayo, a scenic harbor town along the Indian Ocean that was once part of the fabled East African spice empire, has been spared the fighting so far.\nBut the Islamists, Mr. Arab said, did not care.\n''These guys are bent on war,'' he said.\nThe fighting started at around 5 p.m., with the Ethiopian-backed forces unleashing an artillery barrage against Islamist troops dug in near Jilib, a town about 30 miles north of Kismayo.

A large explosion rocked an apartment building in Mogadishu on Saturday night, killing a woman. Some residents said it was a missile fired at nearby Ethiopian troops and possibly the opening salvo of an anti-Ethiopian insurgency. Later in the day, Ethiopian troops began to recede from Mogadishu's streets to barracks on the outskirts of the city.

1815881	A Young Mechanic Improves After Life-Saving Brain Surgery	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807EED71630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Chris Ratuszny went home from Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan on Thursday, 16 days after a brain operation to treat a distended artery deep in his skull that was in danger of bursting and killing him.\nMr. Ratuszny's operation, which involved the experimental use of a laser, was the subject of an article in Science Times on Dec. 19.\nThe laser technique, developed in the Netherlands, has not been approved in the United States, but was allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use in Mr. Ratuszny's case. The laser lets surgeons operate on arteries in the brain without clamping them shut, a necessary step in conventional surgery, but one that can cause a stroke.\nThe experimental technique worked. Mr. Ratuszny (ra-TOOSH-nee), 26, emerged intact -- walking, talking, cracking jokes and eager to see his 3-year-old son, Sam, and return to his job as a Lexus mechanic. He was entirely himself, his family said. The operation had begun to relieve the severe headaches and eye pain he had been suffering for two years because of pressure from the bulging artery, known as a giant aneurysm.\n''I don't think he could do much better,'' said his surgeon, Dr. David J. Langer, the director of cerebrovascular neurosurgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt, Beth Israel and Long Island College Hospital, and an assistant professor at Albert Einstein Medical College.\nBut like many people who have major operations, Mr. Ratuszny had suffered some setbacks. Dr. Langer had predicted that he might have transient speech problems, because the surgery involved the left side of his brain, which controls speech. That prediction came true, but the problems were a bit worse than even Dr. Langer had expected. Tests soon after the operation revealed large blood clots where the aneurysm had been, suggesting that it might have bled during the surgery. Doctors expected the speech difficulties to diminish as the clots dissolved and the pressure on the brain eased.\nMr. Ratuszny began to improve, but another problem developed: a painful, drug-resistant staphylococcus infection that began in his arm, where an intravenous line had been inserted. He needed powerful antibiotics and surgery to drain the infection.\nThen, 10 days after the brain surgery -- just when he was supposed to go home -- Mr. Ratuszny's personality and alertness seemed to sag. Dr. Langer ordered scans and X-rays, and was shocked to find that several major arteries in his brain had gone into spasm, pinching down to only about 20 percent of their normal diameter and restricting the blood supply. The problem, called vasospasm, was most likely a reaction to the blood that had leaked into Mr. Ratuszny's brain from the aneurysm, Dr. Langer said. It responded to treatment and gradually subsided.\nDr. Langer said he expected Mr. Ratuszny to make a full recovery and lead a normal life.

These are among the mysteries for which Dr. Zaki and his colleagues at the Unexplained Deaths Project, or UNEX, serve as the medical detectives of last resort.\nNow, after years of toiling in the subbasement of a 1950s-era building on the C.D.C.'s campus, Dr. Zaki's team has moved to a futuristic-looking building nearby where the window shades automatically rise or fall depending on the amount of sunshine, a transmission electron microscope stands ready to magnify bacteria and viruses up to 740,000 times, and images of deadly pathogens pass for décor.\nStarted in 1995 as an informal collaboration among a handful of C.D.C. scientists determined to identify outbreaks of new infectious diseases before they reached epidemic proportions, UNEX distinguished itself as an interdisciplinary group that brought together the expertise of virologists, bacteriologists, epidemiologists, veterinarians and clinicians. As enthusiasm for the program grew, four affiliates in state health departments opened in California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Oregon.\nDespite their success and the continuing threat of emerging infections, the state programs recently lost their financing, and enthusiasm for UNEX even within the C.D.C. was dwindling, to the point where its very future appeared to be in doubt until late December, when another year's financing was finally approved.\nThe problem, Dr. Zaki said, is that the program's interdisciplinary nature clashes with the trend, at C.D.C. and in science generally, toward specialization. In fact, each researcher involved with UNEX has another position within one of C.D.C.'s specialized departments. Dr. Zaki, for instance, is chief of infectious disease pathology activity.\nThe hundreds of cases referred to UNEX each year by state health authorities, medical examiners and the occasional private physician represent a fraction of the true number of unexplained deaths across the country. Dr. Zaki estimates that there are ''tens of thousands'' of such cases each year. Most are presumed to be caused by infectious agents, usually carried by animals or insects, which is why UNEX is housed in the C.D.C.'s National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne and Enteric Diseases.\n''There are so many cases where we say, 'We know this is infectious,' where I'd bet you anything the death was caused by a virus we can't find,'' Dr. Zaki said.\nIn fact, UNEX is able to find the particular killer pathogen in only about 15 percent of the cases referred to the office, he said.\nOn July 12, 2005, for instance, 19-year-old Aaron O'Neal, a reserve linebacker for the University of Missouri Tigers, collapsed on the field during a preseason workout and died soon after at a hospital. An autopsy found that the lining of his brain had been inflamed, a possible sign of viral meningitis. But even when UNEX received brain tissue samples, no virus or any other clear sign of what caused the inflammation could be detected. Aside from storing the remaining tissue sample on the chance that a new test might one day solve the mystery, the case was closed.\nStill, UNEX collars its share of microbial culprits. On Sept. 13, 2005, a 10-year-old Mississippi boy went to his pediatrician with a fever, headache and an itchy scalp. Within days he became so disoriented and agitated that he bit a family member. Admitted to the hospital, he grew sicker, but all tests came back negative. After he died on Sept. 27, it took UNEX just eight days to detect the rabies virus in serum samples. They later learned, by speaking with friends and family, that dead bats had been previously found inside the boy's home and garage, and that he had removed a live bat from his bedroom and released it outdoors in spring 2005.\nSometimes, finding the cause of a death means discovering a pathogen previously unknown to science. During the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, it was a colleague of Dr. Zaki's, Cynthia Goldsmith, who first identified the SARS coronavirus using an older-generation electron microscope at their old lab. ''It took my breath away when I first recognized it,'' Ms. Goldsmith said.\nThen there are the times when a probable cause of death is suspected, but local health officials are reluctant to perform an autopsy. On Oct. 5, 2001, minutes after a Florida photo retoucher for The National Enquirer died of what appeared to be inhalation anthrax, a doctor who treated the man called Dr. Zaki.\n''The medical examiner wasn't inclined to do the autopsy,'' Dr. Zaki recalled. ''Finally they said, 'O.K., we'll do it, but only if you come down.' ''\nWhen Dr. Zaki and a small group of colleagues flew to Florida the next morning on a private chartered jet, they learned that some of the staff at the Palm Beach County medical examiner's office had had second thoughts about the autopsy.\n''When we got there,'' Dr. Zaki said, ''the people in the facility told us, 'If you do that autopsy, we're all going to leave and never come back. You're going to leave spores, you're going to contaminate the facility.' ''\nDr. Zaki's group explained that the spores become dangerous only if allowed to dry out -- something they would prevent through meticulous cleaning -- and that antibiotics given as prophylaxis would eliminate the slim remaining chance of infection. Even so, they performed the autopsy in a small room used for storage.\n''We left that room much cleaner than when we found it,'' Dr. Zaki said.\nHis own laboratory has an unequalled collection of automated testing equipment and a trove of tissue samples dating back decades.\n''I don't think there's any laboratory like this in the world,'' Dr. Zaki said. ''And there's nowhere else where people from so many different fields are together in such close proximity. It makes one very proud.''\nEgyptian by birth, Dr. Zaki graduated third in his class of 1,200 at the University of Alexandria medical school before coming to the United States to study pathology in 1983.\nAsked why he chose pathology, he replied: ''My mom asked me the same question. She said, 'Be a real doctor.' But pathology explains how and why a disease happens.''\nYet UNEX, as sophisticated as its equipment may be, is still routinely outfoxed by nature's most archaic life forms, the viruses and bacteria whose roles in human disease, and hiding places in blood and tissue samples, continue to defy detection.\n''We think we know everything,'' Dr. Zaki said, ''but we don't know the tip of the iceberg.\n''There are so many viruses and bacteria we don't know anything about, that we don't have tests for,'' he said. ''A hundred years from now, people will not believe the number of pathogens we didn't even know existed.''
1815883	What's Making Us Sick Is an Epidemic of Diagnoses	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EED71630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	For most Americans, the biggest health threat is not avian flu, West Nile or mad cow disease. It's our health-care system.\nYou might think this is because doctors make mistakes (we do make mistakes). But you can't be a victim of medical error if you are not in the system. The larger threat posed by American medicine is that more and more of us are being drawn into the system not because of an epidemic of disease, but because of an epidemic of diagnoses.\nAmericans live longer than ever, yet more of us are told we are sick.\nHow can this be? One reason is that we devote more resources to medical care than any other country. Some of this investment is productive, curing disease and alleviating suffering. But it also leads to more diagnoses, a trend that has become an epidemic.\nThis epidemic is a threat to your health. It has two distinct sources. One is the medicalization of everyday life. Most of us experience physical or emotional sensations we don't like, and in the past, this was considered a part of life. Increasingly, however, such sensations are considered symptoms of disease. Everyday experiences like insomnia, sadness, twitchy legs and impaired sex drive now become diagnoses: sleep disorder, depression, restless leg syndrome and sexual dysfunction.\nPerhaps most worrisome is the medicalization of childhood. If children cough after exercising, they have asthma; if they have trouble reading, they are dyslexic; if they are unhappy, they are depressed; and if they alternate between unhappiness and liveliness, they have bipolar disorder. While these diagnoses may benefit the few with severe symptoms, one has to wonder about the effect on the many whose symptoms are mild, intermittent or transient.\nThe other source is the drive to find disease early. While diagnoses used to be reserved for serious illness, we now diagnose illness in people who have no symptoms at all, those with so-called predisease or those ''at risk.''\nTwo developments accelerate this process. First, advanced technology allows doctors to look really hard for things to be wrong. We can detect trace molecules in the blood. We can direct fiber-optic devices into every orifice. And CT scans, ultrasounds, M.R.I. and PET scans let doctors define subtle structural defects deep inside the body. These technologies make it possible to give a diagnosis to just about everybody: arthritis in people without joint pain, stomach damage in people without heartburn and prostate cancer in over a million people who, but for testing, would have lived as long without being a cancer patient.\nSecond, the rules are changing. Expert panels constantly expand what constitutes disease: thresholds for diagnosing diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and obesity have all fallen in the last few years. The criterion for normal cholesterol has dropped multiple times. With these changes, disease can now be diagnosed in more than half the population.\nMost of us assume that all this additional diagnosis can only be beneficial. And some of it is. But at the extreme, the logic of early detection is absurd. If more than half of us are sick, what does it mean to be normal? Many more of us harbor ''pre-disease'' than will ever get disease, and all of us are ''at risk.'' The medicalization of everyday life is no less problematic. Exactly what are we doing to our children when 40 percent of summer campers are on one or more chronic prescription medications?\nNo one should take the process of making people into patients lightly. There are real drawbacks. Simply labeling people as diseased can make them feel anxious and vulnerable -- a particular concern in children.\nBut the real problem with the epidemic of diagnoses is that it leads to an epidemic of treatments. Not all treatments have important benefits, but almost all can have harms. Sometimes the harms are known, but often the harms of new therapies take years to emerge -- after many have been exposed. For the severely ill, these harms generally pale relative to the potential benefits. But for those experiencing mild symptoms, the harms become much more relevant. And for the many labeled as having predisease or as being ''at risk'' but destined to remain healthy, treatment can only cause harm.\nThe epidemic of diagnoses has many causes. More diagnoses mean more money for drug manufacturers, hospitals, physicians and disease advocacy groups. Researchers, and even the disease-based organization of the National Institutes of Health, secure their stature (and financing) by promoting the detection of ''their'' disease. Medico-legal concerns also drive the epidemic. While failing to make a diagnosis can result in lawsuits, there are no corresponding penalties for overdiagnosis. Thus, the path of least resistance for clinicians is to diagnose liberally -- even when we wonder if doing so really helps our patients.\nAs more of us are being told we are sick, fewer of us are being told we are well. People need to think hard about the benefits and risks of increased diagnosis: the fundamental question they face is whether or not to become a patient. And doctors need to remember the value of reassuring people that they are not sick. Perhaps someone should start monitoring a new health metric: the proportion of the population not requiring medical care. And the National Institutes of Health could propose a new goal for medical researchers: reduce the need for medical services, not increase it.\nESSAY Dr. Welch is the author of ''Should I Be Tested for Cancer?

If she's carrying high, it's a girl. And if she's carrying all the weight out front in the shape of a basketball, then it's probably a boy.\nThis refrain has been around for centuries, repeated in various forms and used by some women to decide whether to go with pink or blue for the baby's room. The claim has its origins in Hippocratic times, when it was believed that male fetuses were conceived on the right and girls on the left, said Dr. Jonathan Schaffir, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Ohio State University.\nBut revered as it may be, the method has no scientific basis. Most experts say the only reason it has persisted for so long is that, much like flipping a coin, there is a 50/50 chance of its being right.\nIn a large 1999 study, researchers at Johns Hopkins recruited 104 pregnant women who did not know the sex of their babies and put the maxim to the test: They found that the shape of the abdomen was a poor predictor of a baby's sex.\nBut some findings were unexpected. Women with more than 12 years of education correctly predicted the sex of their babies about 70 percent of the time, compared with 43 percent of the time for less educated women. And predictions that were based on dreams and feelings, it turned out, were more accurate than those based on the way a woman carried.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE -- The shape of a pregnant woman's belly is a poor predictor of a baby's sex.\nANAHAD O'CONNOR\nReally?
1815885	The Fine Art of Watching a Bug's Life to Explain a Death	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03EED71630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	For a man with a truly curious profession, Robert D. Hall, 59, has a relaxed way of talking about his work.\nDr. Hall, who studies insects and how they live off dead humans, is associate vice chancellor for research at the University of Missouri. He is also a lawyer, a retired Army colonel and a forensic entomologist, meaning that he evaluates insect evidence to help solve crimes. Think of him as Sherlock Holmes with a fly swatter and tweezers.\n''The interesting thing about forensic entomology,'' Dr. Hall said recently, ''is that if you ask insects the right question, they give an honest answer. They've got no motive to lie. Forensic entomologists could be used to great benefit in more criminal matters than they are today.''\nQ. What exactly does a forensic entomologist do?\nA. We're applied biologists. In criminal cases, whenever a dead body is found, law enforcement will immediately try to establish two things: the identity of the victim and their time of death. Forensic entomologists will look at the insects on the corpse -- their size, their origins, their species -- to see if there are clues that might explain the death.\nFor instance, if I'm looking at maggots from a body discovered in a Missouri ditch and I'm seeing a blowfly species endemic to Florida, Lucilia cluvia, that would be a sign the deceased died in Florida.\nQ. How can insects help determine the time of a death?\nA. You can learn it by measuring decomposition, which insects are, of course, an agent of. Without being disrespectful about it, biologically, a dead human is nothing but medium for decomposition. If it weren't for decomposition of all living things, our world would be overfull with dead matter.\nWhen a human dies, female insects will be attracted to the body. They'll enter any of our nine exposed orifices, lay eggs or larvae there. A forensic entomologist will identify these immature insects and measure their size. You look at their size and development, and measure the growth against weather conditions.\nAt a crime scene, the mantra is you collect the largest larvae, because they'll be the oldest. If you have 4-day-old insects, the body has usually been dead four days. This can be critical when the authorities are eliminating an individual as a suspect. Or when that person lacks a good alibi for the time frame, it can move law enforcement to zero in on them.\nI worked on a case where a body was found with its head blown off. When I examined the autopsy material, I found third-stage maggots from two species of blowflies. I then obtained the weather records for the area near where the body was discovered. That's important in determining how quickly blowfly eggs grow in an environment.\nAnd so I was able to come up with a time of death, about three days. The suspect's girlfriend later came forward with supporting testimony. The murder weapon was also found.\nThe way that case worked out, the entomology supported other evidence responsible for convicting this guy of capital murder.\nQ. Are there cases where the insect evidence has freed an individual from prison?\nA. Sure. There's one I worked on in Pennsylvania. At the original trial of a man named Ruby, entomological evidence wasn't introduced, and he was convicted of a killing. Nine years later, Ruby won another trial.\nThis time, the insect evidence was heard, and we were able to establish the time that the victim's torso was dumped along a river. Ruby had an alibi for the time that the body was taken to the river. The entomological evidence was enough to exonerate him.\nQ. Do you ever work on civil cases?\nA. I recently consulted for about 100 plaintiffs suing a large corporate hog farmer. I was able to show these people's homes had become infested by drone flies, the adult stage of rattail maggots, because of large sewage lagoons associated with the nearby hog-containment facility. They got a $5 million verdict.\nOn the other side, I sometimes consult for fast-food establishments. They'll have instances of people coming in saying, ''Two hours ago, you sold me a hamburger with maggots.''\nWhen that happens, the restaurant has me examine the specimens. When I see third-stage housefly maggots, I note a mismatch. Those aren't insects that lay eggs in hamburgers. Moreover, the maggots are too big to be 2 hours old. This suggests the individual may have seeded the hamburger. That's fraud. With this evidence, the establishment probably won't be tied up by a bogus lawsuit.\nQ. What sort of person gets this interested in flies?\nA. Someone who grew up with them. My father was an entomologist with the Smithsonian and later the United States Department of Agriculture. On Saturdays, famous entomologists would sit at my parents' home and tell one fly from another by the way they flew past.\nDuring World War II, my father was in the Pacific campaign. He worked in malaria suppression. Insect-borne diseases were a tremendous problem to the American soldiers as they island-hopped.\nMy dad helped eradicate a dengue fever outbreak on Saipan. That's spread by the Aedes aegypti. I always thought my father had an interesting and adventurous life.\nQ. Do we underappreciate insects?\nA. I think so. They are the most diverse and powerful form of life on earth. Their biomass outweighs that of humans. They're much more adaptable than we are.\nCockroaches? They can absorb much more radiation than a human. Once, I boarded a Navy frigate that was having a tremendous roach infestation. At the bulkhead, I saw a sign, ''Maximum Occupancy 15 Minutes,'' and asked about it. My guide said: ''On the other side of this wall is the nuclear reactor. If we stay at this spot longer than 15 minutes, we'll take on too much radiation.'' The cockroaches weren't bothered at all by the reactor.\nQ. Are insects misunderstood?\nA. In a large part, yes. Our approach, at least in North America, is a very coldhearted one. If there are insects we don't like, we systematically poison them. Yet, we've never been able to completely exterminate even a single insect species. The housefly would be a good example. Hard as we've tried to kill every housefly, we've never gotten the job done.\nQ. Should we rethink our view of insects?\nA. I'd like to see a more ethical attitude toward them. We often don't treat them like fellow organisms on this planet, with a place on it. There are television programs like ''Fear Factor'' where people bite off the heads of hissing cockroaches. Suppose contestants were asked to eat kittens for entertainment? The entire country would be up in arms!\nQ. There's a childhood ditty that goes, ''The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out.'' Can you deconstruct it for us?\nA. That's about the macabre realization that after you are dead there will be worms and maggots. To me, it says, ''Be happy while you can, because sooner or later you're going to be wormy.''\nA CONVERSATION WITH ROBERT D. HALL
1815886	To Protect Against Drug Errors, Ask Questions	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902EED71630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	The elderly aunt of a colleague was sharp as a tack, living on her own and busy doing everything a healthy woman in her 80s might want to do. That is, until she went to the pharmacy to pick up a refill of methazolamide, the pills she took to control her glaucoma, and instead was given methotrexate, a potent chemotherapy drug that suppresses immunity. The woman noticed that the color of the new pills was different from her previous pills and questioned the pharmacist, who told her they were fine. She even counted them, noting that she was short six pills. But on the pharmacist's reassurance, she took them for a month, by which time the drug had seriously suppressed her body's immune system.\nThe woman developed a painful attack of shingles that she couldn't shake off. She lapsed into a coma, and when she finally emerged, she was no longer able to care for herself.\nA similar error befell my father at a leading New York hospital. After weeks of intensive care following a massive heart attack, he was sent home with medication from the hospital pharmacy to prevent his body from rejecting his damaged heart. He was about to take the first pill when my mother noticed that the name on the vial was Mrs. Rosenberg, not Sidney Brody, and that it contained estrogen, not the prednisone my father needed.\nMedication errors are among the most common medical mistakes, injuring or killing at least 1.5 million people a year and incurring at least $3.5 billion a year in extra hospital costs alone, according to a report issued in July by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. This was the institute's second report on the subject, and the committee that compiled it stated that insufficient progress had been made since its first report, ''To Err Is Human,'' was issued in 1999.\n''We need a comprehensive approach to reducing these errors that involves not just health care organizations and federal agencies, but the industry and consumers as well,'' said Linda R. Cronenwett, dean of the School of Nursing at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and co-chairwoman of the institute committee.\nWhile consumers can do little to improve drug-prescribing procedures in organizations, they can do a lot more to protect themselves.\nKnow What You Are Taking\nPreventing medication mishaps starts with knowing what medications you are taking -- or supposed to be taking -- and how they might interact with other drugs, supplements or herbal remedies you take and even the foods you eat.\nFar too many patients leave the doctor's office or medical clinic with a prescription that borders on the illegible. They may have been told the category of the drug -- antibiotic, for example, or painkiller -- but not its name. And they may have at best a vague memory of how to take it -- how much, when and with what. Rarely are they warned of possible adverse effects and what to do if they notice no improvement or a downturn in their health.\nYou can help protect yourself by maintaining a list of all the drugs you take -- prescription and nonprescription, vitamin-mineral supplements and herbal remedies, including the dosing schedule and amount. Bring this list with you whenever you visit the doctor and make sure it is reviewed by the health care provider.\nIf you have ever experienced an allergic reaction to a medication, or have a food allergy, be sure to tell your health care provider before any medication is prescribed.\nWhen you are given a prescription, ask the name of the drug, what it is supposed to do for your condition, how much to take and how often it should be taken, whether it should be taken with food or on an empty stomach, what side effects are possible and what effects warrant a prompt call to the doctor. Also ask how the medication might interact with other remedies you take or foods you eat. And, of course, write down the answers while you are still in the doctor's office.\nWhen picking up the prescription, check the name and dosing schedule against what the doctor told you. If the labels are too small to read, bring a magnifying glass or ask the pharmacist or someone with better vision to read it to you.\nIf you have any questions, ask. It is the pharmacist's responsibility to explain how to take the drug properly, its side effects and what to do if you experience them. The pharmacist can also provide written information about the drug.\nMany consumers sign a book when they pick up a prescription, not realizing that their signature means they have received needed information about the drug or that they are waiving their right to such information.\nWhen patients are too ill to obtain adequate information about their medications, a surrogate -- family member, friend, or, in a hospital, a nurse, social worker or patient advocate -- should obtain it for them.\nThe Institute of Medicine committee noted that hospitalized patients have a right to have a surrogate with them whenever they receive medication and are unable to monitor the process themselves. Many mistakes are made when hospital personnel administer the wrong drug or the wrong dose, give the drug by the wrong means (intravenously instead of intramuscularly, for instance) or to the wrong patient.\nThe administering nurse should always check the patient's hospital bracelet against the name on the medication before giving it and should tell the patient the purpose for a drug each time it is administered.\nIf you are scheduled for surgery or an invasive exam like a colonoscopy, make sure you ask what drugs you can or should take preoperatively and which you should stop taking. Aspirin and its over-the-counter relatives, as well as prescribed blood thinners, can result in uncontrolled bleeding during such procedures.\nBefore leaving the hospital, ask for a list of the medications you should be taking at home. Have the provider go over the list with you and be sure you understand how much of each to take and how to take it. Again, write it down or have your surrogate write it for you.\nFollow Directions\nFailure to take medications according to the prescribed directions is one of the most common reasons for bad outcomes. Sometimes this results from a misunderstanding of dosage schedules. The label may say ''Take one capsule every six hours'' but the patient assumes, incorrectly, that this does not include the hours during sleep. Or the patient, whose native language is Spanish, may read ''once'' as 11 o'clock, as it could be interpreted in Spanish, instead of as one time.\nIt is vitally important to follow warnings about possible drug or food interactions or hazards operating motorized equipment, including cars, while taking the medication.\nMost pharmacies now routinely place yellow warning stickers on medicine vials, and many include patient information leaflets with the drugs they dispense. It is the consumer's job to read these and follow directions like ''take with food'' or ''do not drink alcohol while on this drug.''\nMany consumers now check out prescription and alternative remedies on the Internet. This can be risky because most of this information is posted by lay or commercial sources, not medical experts. If you use the Web, make sure the information is provided by an official government source, such as the National Library of Medicine's MedlinePlus program (www.medlineplus.gov), which provides easy-to-read drug information and interactive tutorials.\nPERSONAL HEALTH
1815887	Study Links Heart Health And Post-Traumatic Stress	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEED71630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	A racing pulse, a tendency to startle at loud noises, nightmares and flashbacks -- these are the familiar symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. But a new study suggests that combat veterans who suffer from the disorder may also be at increased risk for heart attacks and fatal coronary heart disease.\nThe study is the first to suggest that the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or P.T.S.D., may actually be a cause of heart disease. And the more severe the symptoms of P.T.S.D., the researchers found, the greater the risk for disease.\nThe analysis was based on data from 1,946 veterans participating in a continuing study. The men, whose average age at the start of the study was about 62, had no pre-existing heart problems. Beginning in 1986, they were followed for more than 10 years, with periodic physical examinations and the updating of their medical records. Two self-administered scales were used to assess the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and to estimate their severity.\nOver the course of the study, which appears in the January issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry, 255 of the men developed either nonfatal heart attacks, fatal coronary heart disease or angina pectoris, the chest pain associated with heart problems.\nThe number and severity of the veterans' symptoms were significantly associated with nonfatal heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease, and somewhat less strongly linked to angina.\nThese results, the authors suggest, mean that people with more symptoms of the stress disorder are not simply prone to reporting aches and pains but actually at higher risk for disease.\n''In this sample, symptom levels were actually low to moderate,'' said Laura D. Kubzansky, the lead author and an assistant professor of society, human development and health at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''So the fact that we have evidence of risk at these levels means that at even higher levels of symptomatology, where people might be significantly distressed and meet diagnostic criteria for P.T.S.D., you would expect to see even higher levels of risk.''\nThe exact mechanism through which post-traumatic stress might affect heart health is not known, but some researchers have suggested that the stress-caused release of hormones called catecholamines may lead to injury of the coronary arteries by altering blood flow or setting off chemical changes in the body. These hormones may also encourage the release of fatty acids that can be harmful to the heart.\nThe new study, the authors say, is the first to demonstrate an association between heart disease and symptoms of post-traumatic stress while controlling for many of the variables that might affect risk, including depression, smoking, a family history of heart disease, cholesterol levels and alcohol consumption.\nThe researchers acknowledge that the study's findings pertain largely to older white men who served in the military and therefore cannot be generalized to women, nonwhite men or civilians. Also, the data on psychological symptoms (although not on heart disease) depend on self-reports by the veterans rather than on interviews by doctors, and therefore may be less reliable.\nThe fact that the researchers determined the presence of post-traumatic stress before the onset of any heart disease strengthens the findings, they said, because it eliminates the problems of recall bias, when people erroneously attribute an illness to some unconnected event or anxiety in the past.\nFor a long time, Dr. Kubzansky said, people have assumed that those with anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder were simply more likely than others to report pain, and that the pain might not be real.\nBut the new findings, she continued, ''suggest that there are significant cardiotoxic effects of these disorders beyond just a sense of discomfort or pain.\n''We should be concerned about P.T.S.D. because it's a bad outcome in and of itself,'' she said. ''But this makes an even stronger argument that we should pay attention to those who have it to make sure they don't develop further problems down the road.''
1815888	Cholesterol Level and Parkinson's May Be Linked	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEED71630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Very low levels of LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, may be linked with an increased risk for Parkinson's disease, a new study suggests.\nResearchers compared blood levels of LDL cholesterol in 124 Parkinson's patients with a control group of 112 of their healthy spouses. Compared with people in the highest one-quarter in LDL levels, those in the lower 75 percent were two to three and a half times as likely to suffer from Parkinson's. There was no association between Parkinson's and levels of HDL cholesterol.\nNormally, having a low LDL level is a healthy sign. But does this mean that having a higher LDL is actually a good thing? Absolutely not, said Dr. Xuemei Huang, the lead author of the study.\n''If a person is healthy with a cholesterol in the middle range, and no family history of heart disease, radically lowering cholesterol may not be necessary,'' she said. ''But at the same time, we're not urging anyone to change his diet or medication based on this finding.'' Dr. Huang is a Parkinson's expert and a neurologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.\nThe findings, based on retrospective data, could not demonstrate a cause and effect relationship between a low level of LDL and Parkinson's, the authors said. The paper was published online Dec. 18 in the journal Movement Disorders.\nMen and women in the study who used cholesterol-lowering drugs were about a third as likely to have Parkinson's as those who did not use the drugs. This finding led researchers to suggest that testing the effect of statins on neurodegenerative disease with a much larger sample of patients could be useful.\nVITAL SIGNS: AT RISK
1815889	Cookie Conundrum in the Doctor-Patient Drama	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E7D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	She always came on time to our sessions, even in the thick of a Boston blizzard. She always wore the best clothing her hardscrabble life in ''the projects'' permitted her. And after each session, she would place a small bag of her homemade cookies on my desk, leaving with a shy smile that flickered with pride.\nMy intake evaluation read, ''adjustment disorder with depressed mood, rule out major depression,'' but the language of diagnosis sometimes slights the burdens of life. Her husband was distant, uncaring, probably abusive. She had a ne'er-do-well son with a nasty drug problem, who periodically ''crashed'' at her apartment in various states of intoxication. Most of my patient's time was spent trying to make ends meet and avoiding the dangers of home and neighborhood.\nAlthough I prescribed an antidepressant, most of our work involved supportive psychotherapy: basically, shoring up the patient's battered defenses and teaching her new ways of coping with old problems. It's not the kind of work that Freud made famous, but it's what many patients need. And in contrast to psychoanalytic forms of therapy, fancy interpretations are usually kept to a minimum -- which brings me back to the cookies.\nGifts of any kind from a patient pose a problem for psychiatrists and other mental health professionals -- something we refer to as a ''boundary issue.'' The public usually reads about such problems when much more dangerous borders are crossed, like when a therapist becomes sexually involved with a patient.\nBut psychotherapy is rarely the stuff of banner headlines. Most of the time, our work with patients is fraught with more mundane questions, ranging from what you should say if you accidentally step on a patient's toe (''Excuse me, I'm very sorry!'' is my usual line) to whether putting a hand on a patient's shoulder is ever appropriate (it sometimes is, if it is done to comfort her).\nThese subtleties may be less attended to in today's managed-care climate, with its infamous 15-minute sessions to check medications. Fifteen minutes is usually how long it would take for my patients to start speaking. But therapists who carry on the psychoanalytic tradition of the 50-minute hour know that respecting the subtle boundaries of treatment remains the cornerstone of competent care.\nPsychiatrists are routinely waved away from accepting lavish gifts -- an expensive watch, say, or a Gucci handbag -- and we are trained to examine the underlying issues that might be driving patients' needs to give us such gifts. Does the patient feel that his work with the therapist is not good enough -- that it must be supplemented by ritual offerings? Does the patient believe that by offering gifts to the therapist, she will avoid being scolded or abandoned?\nI wasn't sure what to say to my patient about the cookies, besides my usual ''Thank you very much.''\nAt the end of a long and wearying day, I found something comforting in those moist, chewy morsels. And truth be told, both my wife and I enjoyed them. Maybe I had a vested interest in keeping a good thing going -- was that why I didn't explore the underlying meaning of the gesture?\nThen again, as Freud might say, sometimes a gift is just a gift. Sometimes a patient simply wants to express gratitude for the therapist's help, and does not want the gesture analyzed to death.\n''He is a good man who can receive a gift well,'' Emerson writes in a famous essay. He compares gift-giving to the flowing of one soul into another.\n''When the waters are at level, then my goods pass to him, and his to me,'' he writes.\nA true gift, in short, is an intermingling of respect and affection between equals. Patients often enter psychotherapy feeling more like a swamp than a rolling river. As they improve, they may feel ready to present themselves as the therapist's equals -- or at least, as ones who are no longer supplicants. The therapist needs to know when to interpret a gift, and when simply to let the level waters flow.\nMy patient had not initiated her gift-giving until she had started to feel better, and I felt this was a clue of some kind. Interpreting her ritual might have left my patient wondering: ''Is there something wrong with what I'm doing? Is my gift not good enough?''\nDoctors are sometimes chastised for presuming to tell a patient's story. In reality, it is our own stories we tell: how we missed a diagnosis, or got one right; how we failed a patient, or helped her recover a piece of her life.\nIt's been more than a decade since my work with the patient who brought me cookies, and I'm able to hear her now in ways I never could back then. I hear her telling me that though her life is hard and bitter, she can still thank me with something soft and sweet.\nCASES
1815890	Vitamin Does Not Prevent Death by Heart Disease	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E7D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Vitamin B12 supplements are not effective in preventing strokes, heart attacks or death in people with a history of vascular disease, a new review of studies concludes. Vitamin B12 reduces the blood levels of homocysteine, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but the reduction apparently has no effect on survival.\nThe review covered 12 studies with 16,598 participants who had pre-existing illness. All of the studies showed a reduction in homocysteine levels in people who took folate supplements, but there was no correlation between the amount of reduction in blood levels of homocysteine and the risk of heart attacks, coronary heart disease, stroke or mortality from any cause, and no difference between those who took folate supplements and the participants in control groups who took none.\n''We haven't found any magical supplement pills to prevent cardiovascular disease,'' said Dr. Lydia A. Bazzano, the lead author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.\n''The things people have to do are hard; they have to quit smoking, exercise, lose weight, eat properly,'' Dr. Bazzano continued. ''This means getting omega-3 fatty acids and a well-balanced diet in terms of carbohydrates and proteins. And eating fruits and vegetables is always good. No one has been able to contradict that yet.''\nThe study, published in the Dec. 13 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, covered only people who were already ill with vascular disease, but the authors wrote that no randomized, controlled trials have shown a beneficial effect of B12 supplements in preventing vascular disease in healthy people, either.\nVITAL SIGNS: HEART HEALTH

Beginning at 20 weeks of pregnancy and continuing until the women gave birth, the first group took a daily dose of four grams of fish oil, while the second group took four grams of olive oil each day. Neither the mothers nor the researchers knew which supplement the women had received until the study ended.\nThe researchers examined 72 children born to women who completed the study when the children were 2 1/2 years old. In tests of locomotor ability, speech and hearing, vocabulary and practical reasoning, the children whose mothers were given fish oil during pregnancy scored slightly higher, but the differences were not statistically significant. However, after controlling for maternal age, birth weight, breast-feeding and other factors, the children of the women who took fish oil were significantly better at hand-eye coordination than those of the women who took the olive oil supplement.\nThe authors acknowledged that their sample was small, and that they could not exclude the possibility that the result was due to chance. Still, children who received prenatal fish oil did consistently perform better on all measures of development.\n''These preliminary data indicate that supplementation with a relatively high-dose fish oil during the last 20 weeks of pregnancy is not only safe,'' the authors concluded, ''but also seems to have potential beneficial effects that need to be explored further.''\nVITAL SIGNS: NUTRITION
1815892	Exercising Helps Dieters Preserve Bone Strength	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E7D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	When overweight people lose weight, they often lose bone mineral density as well, increasing their risk for osteoporosis. But new research suggests that losing weight with exercise rather than calorie restriction can preserve bone strength.\nScientists randomly assigned 48 healthy, non-obese people in their 50s to three groups for a one-year study. The first group reduced calorie intake by 16 percent in the first three months and then 20 percent for the rest of the year. The second increased daily energy expenditure -- exercise, in other words -- by 16 percent in the first three months and then by 20 percent for the following nine months, carefully tracked by trainers using heart rate monitors. A control group was monitored without being assigned a diet or exercise program. The results appear in the Dec. 11 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine.\nThe diet group lost an average of about 17 pounds; the exercise group about 14 pounds. But the people on the low-calorie diet also lost bone mineral density -- more than 2 percent at the spine, hips and leg. Those in the exercise group experienced no significant change in bone density, and the controls lost neither weight nor bone density.\nThe authors acknowledge that their sample was not large and did not examine sex differences in bone mineral density responses.\nDr. Dennis T. Villareal, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, recommends diet and exercise together in a weight-loss program. ''That way, you get the weight loss benefits of the diet,'' he said, ''but prevent the negative effect on bone health.''\nVITAL SIGNS: ON THE SCALES
1815893	When Bad Things Come From 'Good' Food	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E7D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	People in the United States have gotten used to the repulsive fact that raw chicken, meat and eggs are often contaminated with dangerous bacteria. Scrub the cutting board, we are warned, don't nibble the cookie dough, don't eat burgers rare. In other words, handle meat like a biohazard -- and then eat it.\nBut until recently, getting sick from salad was something that most Americans didn't even think about unless they were traveling to a poor country. At home, fruits and vegetables have been regarded as clean and safe for as long as most people can remember.\nLately, though, produce has caused a disturbing number of disease outbreaks; just since September, bacteria-tainted tomatoes, spinach and lettuce have made hundreds of people sick, and killed three. There have been 20 serious outbreaks in the past decade or so, and many have come from crops grown in California, not from imports. Fruit juices, alfalfa sprouts and almonds have also been involved -- all of them supposedly health foods, like salad, the things we feel most virtuous about eating.\nThe known outbreaks are just the tip of the iceberg, health officials say; far more illness is never reported. Most people don't call the health department about a few days of gut trouble. The government estimates that over all, food-borne microbes -- not just the ones on produce -- make 76 million people a year sick, put 325,000 in the hospital and kill 5,000.\nIn a modern country, a rise in disease caused by tainted food seems like a giant step backward in public health. But there hasn't been much public outrage or even disgust at the notion of filth seeping into the food supply.\nAmong the nastiest bacteria is E. coli 0157:H7, which makes a powerful toxin that can cause severe illness and sometimes even kidney failure. This is the germ found on spinach a few months ago, and more recently on iceberg lettuce served at Taco Bell restaurants. It comes from cow feces and was first identified in 1982. Feeding the animals grain instead of hay seems to promote its growth.\nThe strain is harmless to cows, but in people it is so dangerous, according to the Food and Drug Administration, that swallowing as few as 10 organisms may be enough to cause an infection. About 73,000 people a year get sick from this type of bacteria, and 61 die, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.\n''It's gotten more attention this fall, but we've seen these outbreaks due to lettuce and other leafy greens for a long time,'' said Dr. Christopher Braden, chief of the outbreak response and surveillance team for enteric diseases at the disease centers. ''We are seeing this on an ongoing basis. That's not an acceptable outcome. We need to find ways to interrupt that contamination.''\nLast August, the F.D.A. announced a ''lettuce safety initiative'' in response to recurring E. coli outbreaks. It began with last fall's lettuce harvest and included visits by inspectors to farms and cooling and packing facilities. But the spinach and Taco Bell outbreaks happened anyway.\nThere are several ways that bacteria can contaminate lettuce. Water is an obvious route, whether from unsanitary irrigation or spraying, or from flooding. Animals can carry bacteria onto farmland, which is apparently how the spinach outbreak occurred -- feral pigs wandered from cow pastures to spinach fields, taking E. coli with them. Sick workers who handle produce can also contaminate it, and so can dust blowing off pastures. One bad batch can spoil others when they are mixed for chopping and bagging.\nScientists think most contamination lies on the surface of crops, but studies have shown that it is possible for bacteria to be taken up through root systems and actually wind up inside the plants, where no amount of washing could get rid of it. In any case, E. coli 0157:H7 tends to be sticky and is difficult or impossible to wash off, even when it's only on the surface of produce.\nOver the past 30 years, diseases linked to produce have increased, Dr. Braden said. Increased ability to detect outbreaks may explain part of the increase, but not all of it, he added.\n''We're convinced it's real in large part,'' he said. ''We're seeing an increased number of outbreaks, an increased number of cases in outbreaks, and an increase in the number of types of produce involved.''\nThe reason is not known for sure. But, Dr. Braden said: ''The way produce is farmed and processed has changed. It's become more centralized, and you have these huge processors and distributors that produce tens of thousands of pounds of a particular produce in a particular day. If something goes wrong with that produce you've got a big problem, whereas with small farmers, if there is a problem it's much more limited.''\nIn addition, he said, bagged and prewashed produce didn't exist 25 years ago, and people today eat more raw vegetables than in the past.\n''There's probably more susceptible people eating those things,'' Dr. Braden said. ''We have an aging population, and more people with chronic medical conditions that might make them more susceptible.''\nThe F.D.A. is responsible for produce safety, while the Agriculture Department oversees meat, poultry and eggs. Some politicians have urged that a single new agency be formed to take charge of all food safety, but even if that is done, it still may not answer basic questions about how to clean up produce.\nDr. David W. K. Acheson, chief medical officer at the center for food safety and applied nutrition at the F.D.A., said the agency was trying to find ways to prevent outbreaks.\nBut, Dr. Acheson said, it has nowhere near the resources to inspect the hundreds of thousands of facilities that handle fresh produce in the United States. The Agriculture Department has far more inspectors and is required by law to have one in every major meat processing plant.\nOne question the drug agency is trying to figure out, he said, is how close is too close when it comes to cattle and produce.\n''We know that 0157 is a natural contaminant of cow feces,'' Dr. Acheson said. ''Cow feces, if it gets on fresh produce, is not good. Should there be some limitation as to how close cattle should be to a leafy-greens field? Fifty feet, 5 miles, 50 miles? What's the science?''\nFifty feet may be plenty if the cows are downhill and downstream of the farm, he said -- but if it's the other way around, five miles may not be enough.\n''What's really going to work?'' Dr. Acheson asked. ''At this point, there are a lot of unknowns.''\nAnother approach, instead of trying to prevent contamination, is to get rid of it after the fact. Nuts can be heat-treated and juices can be pasteurized. Some experts have recommended irradiating lettuce.\n''People in the agency are looking at the impact of that,'' Dr. Acheson said. ''There are two pieces: does it work, and what dose do you need? Then, what's the impact of that dose on the quality of the product? You could irradiate anything and sterilize it, but you may end up with mush. It's not quite that easy.''\nDr. Braden said that so far, scientists had not found any way to prevent outbreaks.\n''Not that people aren't working on it hard,'' he said, adding that the food industry itself is under pressure.\n''There may be some self-regulation from the industry, the growers themselves,'' he said. ''They have to do something themselves, or else they're going to lose their market.''\nSECOND OPINION
1815894	Celebrating Movie Musicals That Are Never Out of Date	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E7D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	You can't accuse the New York Philharmonic of not having a sense of occasion. As it often does, the orchestra set aside the formalities of the classical repertory on New Year's Eve in favor of lighter fare, although this time another kind of formality was evident. With Audra McDonald in the spotlight, her regular conductor, Ted Sperling, on the podium, and a jazz rhythm section deployed within the orchestra, the Philharmonic offered an evening of songs drawn mostly from film musicals of the 1930s through the '50s.\nIt was a program steeped in nostalgia for a time that, with increasing distance and the rapid pace of change, is taking on a patina of elegance, which was reflected in the staging. Four Art Deco panels surrounding the orchestra, along with a few oversize, 1940s-style spotlights and a glittery curtain behind the players, created the look of a ballroom stage as it might have been depicted in a vintage film.\nThe women in the orchestra wore bright colors, and the men wore standard concert dress, which is sufficiently old-fashioned to suit the stage picture created by Lonny Price, the production supervisor. And although they were technologically anachronistic, the ''Live From Lincoln Center'' cameras that occasionally reared up on the stage seemed, for once, at home in this picture rather than an imposition.\nMs. McDonald approached her repertory mostly as a celebration of film music she loves, and occasionally -- when singing Judy Garland classics like ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' and ''The Man That Got Away'' -- with a reverence that seemed overstated. Yes, the originals were fantastic, perhaps even unmatchable. But if you believe that these songs have lives of their own (as any singer of this material must), you might as well sing them unapologetically.\nMs. McDonald staked out her own interpretive ground in this material. In ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow,'' ''As Time Goes By'' and ''Moon River'' her phrasing was thoroughly personalized, with rhythms subtly altered and a thoughtful delivery that illuminated the lyrics.\nThe arrangements were often personalized as well. Although most had a big-band flavor that reflected their eras and justified the Philharmonic musicians, for the songs that seemed to mean the most to her, Ms. McDonald opted for lighter support.\nFor ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' and ''Edelweiss,'' that was Kevin Kuhn's solo guitar (with Glenn Dicterow, the concertmaster, adding a sweet-toned violin solo on ''Edelweiss''). For ''As Time Goes By,'' it was piano, played by Lee Musiker, and for her zesty account of ''I Wish I Were in Love Again,'' she was accompanied by Mr. Musiker and Mr. Sperling, performing as a piano duo.\nMs. McDonald, curiously, was at her least moving in slow, intimate music, her thoughtful restructuring notwithstanding. In more energetic music, like the virtuosic patter song ''I Can't Stop Talking About Him,'' her alternately sultry and humorous account of ''I Double Dare You'' and her bright (if brief) rendering of ''Singin' in the Rain,'' she was immeasurably more effective, and her sound was more varied as well.\nThe Philharmonic musicians played energetically when the music invited it, and its brass players in particular seemed in their element, as if they secretly wished they were working for Wynton Marsalis instead of Lorin Maazel. Mr. Sperling led them in two pieces without Ms. McDonald: ''The Night They Invented Champagne,'' as an overture to the program, and ''Dancing in the Dark'' during her gown change.\nMUSIC REVIEW
1815895	From Far Beneath the Israeli Desert, Water Sustains a Fertile Enterprise	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E7D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	The day's coppery last light reflects off the backs of sea bass swimming in fish ponds lined in neat rows on this desert farm.\nFish farming in the desert may at first sound like an anomaly, but in Israel over the last decade a scientific hunch has turned into a bustling business.\nScientists here say they realized they were on to something when they found that brackish water drilled from underground desert aquifers hundreds of feet deep could be used to raise warm-water fish. The geothermal water, less than one-tenth as saline as sea water, free of pollutants and a toasty 98 degrees on average, proved an ideal match.\n''It was not simple to convince people that growing fish in the desert makes sense,'' said Samuel Appelbaum, a professor and fish biologist at the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research at the Sede Boqer campus of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n''It is important to stop with the reputation that arid land is nonfertile, useless land,'' said Professor Appelbaum, who pioneered the concept of desert aquaculture in Israel in the late 1980s. ''We should consider arid land where subsurface water exists as land that has great opportunities, especially in food production because of the low level of competition on the land itself and because it gives opportunities to its inhabitants.''\nThe next step in this country, where water is scarce and expensive, was to show farmers that they could later use the water in which the fish are raised to irrigate their crops in a system called double usage. The organic waste produced by the cultured fish makes the water especially useful, because it acts as fertilizer for the crops.\nFields watered by brackish water dot Israel's Negev and Arava Deserts in the south of the country, where they spread out like green blankets against a landscape of sand dunes and rocky outcrops. At Kibbutz Mashabbe Sade in the Negev, the recycled water from the fish ponds is used to irrigate acres of olive and jojoba groves. Elsewhere it is also used for irrigating date palms and alfalfa.\nThe chain of multiple users for the water is potentially a model that can be copied, especially in arid third world countries where farmers struggle to produce crops, and Israeli scientists have recently been peddling their ideas abroad.\nDry lands cover about 40 percent of the planet, and the people who live on them are often among the poorest in the world. Scientists are working to share the desert aquaculture technology they fine-tuned here with Tanzania, India, Australia and China, among others. (Similar methods of fish farming are also being used in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona.)\n''Each farm could run itself, which is important in the developing world,'' said Alon Tal, a leading Israeli environmental activist who recently organized a conference on desertification, with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and Ben-Gurion University, that brought policy makers and scientists from 30 countries to Israel.\n''A whole village could adopt such a system,'' Dr. Tal added.\nAt the conference, Gregoire de Kalbermatten, deputy secretary general of the antidesertification group at the United Nations, said, ''We need to learn from the resilience of Israel in developing dry lands.''\nIsrael, long heralded for its agricultural success in the desert through innovative technologies like drip irrigation, has found ways to use low-quality water and what is considered terrible soil to grow produce like sweet cherry tomatoes, peppers, asparagus and melon, marketing much of it abroad to Europe, especially during winter.\n''Most development is still driven by the Zionist ethos that the desert was some mistake of God that we have to correct and make the desert bloom,'' said Uriel Safriel, an ecology professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nThe history of fish-farming in nondesert areas here, mostly in the Galilee region near the sea, dates back to the late 1920s, before Israel was established as a state. At the time, the country was extremely poor and meat was considered a luxury. But fish was a cheap food source, so fish farms were set up on several kibbutzim in the Galilee.\nThe early Jewish farmers were mostly Eastern European, and, Professor Safriel said, ''they only knew gefilte fish, so they grew carp.''\nEventually they expanded to other varieties of fish including tilapia, striped bass and mullet, as well as ornamental fish.\nThe past decade has seen the establishment of about 15 fish farms producing both edible and ornamental fish in the Negev and Arava Deserts.\nFish farming, meanwhile, has become more lucrative worldwide as people seek more fish in their diet for better health, and ocean fisheries increasingly are being depleted.\nThe practice is not without critics, who say it can harm the environment and the fish. In Israel there was a decision by the government to stop fish farming in the Red Sea near the southern city of Eilat by 2008 because it was deemed damaging to nearby coral reefs.\nSome also argue that the industry is not sustainable in the long term because most of the fish that are farmed are carnivorous and must be fed a protein-rich diet of other fish, usually caught in the wild. Another criticism is that large numbers of fish are kept in relatively small areas, leading to a higher risk of disease.\nProfessor Appelbaum said the controversy surrounding fish farming in ocean areas does not apply to desert aquaculture, which is in an isolated, controlled area, with much less competition for resources.\nOn Kibbutz Mashabbe Sade, Amit Ziv runs a fish farm, raising about 15,000 fish at a time. Up to 500,000 cubic meters of water from the fish ponds is recycled for irrigation every year.\n''It's a matter of better efficiency,'' said Mr. Ziv, who pays about 24 cents a cubic meter for water, a government-subsidized rate. ''In an area where there is lack of water, being able to use it twice over is a huge advantage.'' Mr. Ziv, 39, said there are benefits to raising fish in the desert: the dryness translates to fewer insects and less mold and disease. He also said the warm air makes it easier to keep the pools temperate.\nHe remembers the stories his parents, who, along with other founders of the kibbutz in 1948, would tell of having to travel long days to get to the fields of the communal farm. They then tilled closer to central Israel, because at the time the local arid ground was thought to be impossible to farm.\n''Now,'' he said, pointing toward the desert-grown crops, ''the fields are all here.''\nMr. Ziv and his dog turned back toward the fish ponds stretched out under green plastic hothouse canopies. It was time to prepare for a shipment of hatchlings that was to arrive the next day.
1815896	Pets Are No Panacea, at Least for Finns	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE7D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Pets are supposed to be good for you, right? Consider the various sorts of pet therapy, or studies that suggest that a nuzzle from a dog can lower blood pressure or even nudge someone out of a coma. Some surveys have found that people who have pets report fewer doctor visits and better mental health. Even longer survival after heart attacks has been reported.\nAnd dog-walking must provide exercise and all the benefits that come with it. It only stands to reason that pet owners should be healthier than others. Doesn't it?\nWell, not in Finland. Leena K. Koivusilta and Ansa Ojanlatva, two researchers at the University of Turku, looked through data collected in a health survey of 21,101 Finns. Among the questions the participants were asked was whether they owned pets.\nNo matter how the researchers sliced the data, they found that the pet owners looked, if anything, sicker than pet-free people. Pet owners were more likely to suffer from illnesses that included high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers, depression and kidney disease. They smoked more (though drank less) than people who did not own pets.\nThey were also fatter, particularly the dog owners, the researchers reported in the current issue of the journal PLoS ONE.\nThat does not mean pets induce disease. At least in Finland, pet owners tended to be poorer, less educated and older, and those factors, rather than pets, probably explain the health disparity.\nNor does it mean that pets aren't good for you. It's just that the benefits may not be medical.\nKENNETH CHANG\nFINDINGS
1815897	Free Will: Now You Have It, Now You Don't	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	I was a free man until they brought the dessert menu around. There was one of those molten chocolate cakes, and I was suddenly being dragged into a vortex, swirling helplessly toward caloric doom, sucked toward the edge of a black (chocolate) hole. Visions of my father's heart attack danced before my glazed eyes. My wife, Nancy, had a resigned look on her face.\nThe outcome, endlessly replayed whenever we go out, is never in doubt, though I often cover my tracks by offering to split my dessert with the table. O.K., I can imagine what you're thinking. There but for the grace of God.\nHaving just lived through another New Year's Eve, many of you have just resolved to be better, wiser, stronger and richer in the coming months and years. After all, we're free humans, not slaves, robots or animals doomed to repeat the same boring mistakes over and over again. As William James wrote in 1890, the whole ''sting and excitement'' of life comes from ''our sense that in it things are really being decided from one moment to another, and that it is not the dull rattling off of a chain that was forged innumerable ages ago.'' Get over it, Dr. James. Go get yourself fitted for a new chain-mail vest. A bevy of experiments in recent years suggest that the conscious mind is like a monkey riding a tiger of subconscious decisions and actions in progress, frantically making up stories about being in control.\nAs a result, physicists, neuroscientists and computer scientists have joined the heirs of Plato and Aristotle in arguing about what free will is, whether we have it, and if not, why we ever thought we did in the first place.\n''Is it an illusion? That's the question,'' said Michael Silberstein, a science philosopher at Elizabethtown College in Maryland. Another question, he added, is whether talking about this in public will fan the culture wars.\n''If people freak at evolution, etc.,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, ''how much more will they freak if scientists and philosophers tell them they are nothing more than sophisticated meat machines, and is that conclusion now clearly warranted or is it premature?''\nDaniel C. Dennett, a philosopher and cognitive scientist at Tufts University who has written extensively about free will, said that ''when we consider whether free will is an illusion or reality, we are looking into an abyss. What seems to confront us is a plunge into nihilism and despair.''\nMark Hallett, a researcher with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said, ''Free will does exist, but it's a perception, not a power or a driving force. People experience free will. They have the sense they are free.\n''The more you scrutinize it, the more you realize you don't have it,'' he said.\nThat is hardly a new thought. The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said, as Einstein paraphrased it, that ''a human can very well do what he wants, but cannot will what he wants.''\nEinstein, among others, found that a comforting idea. ''This knowledge of the non-freedom of the will protects me from losing my good humor and taking much too seriously myself and my fellow humans as acting and judging individuals,'' he said.\nHow comforted or depressed this makes you might depend on what you mean by free will. The traditional definition is called ''libertarian'' or ''deep'' free will. It holds that humans are free moral agents whose actions are not predetermined. This school of thought says in effect that the whole chain of cause and effect in the history of the universe stops dead in its tracks as you ponder the dessert menu.\nAt that point, anything is possible. Whatever choice you make is unforced and could have been otherwise, but it is not random. You are responsible for any damage to your pocketbook and your arteries.\n''That strikes many people as incoherent,'' said Dr. Silberstein, who noted that every physical system that has been investigated has turned out to be either deterministic or random. ''Both are bad news for free will,'' he said. So if human actions can't be caused and aren't random, he said, ''It must be -- what -- some weird magical power?''\nPeople who believe already that humans are magic will have no problem with that.\nBut whatever that power is -- call it soul or the spirit -- those people have to explain how it could stand independent of the physical universe and yet reach from the immaterial world and meddle in our own, jiggling brain cells that lead us to say the words ''molten chocolate.''\nA vote in favor of free will comes from some physicists, who say it is a prerequisite for inventing theories and planning experiments.\nThat is especially true when it comes to quantum mechanics, the strange paradoxical theory that ascribes a microscopic randomness to the foundation of reality. Anton Zeilinger, a quantum physicist at the University of Vienna, said recently that quantum randomness was ''not a proof, just a hint, telling us we have free will.''\nIs there any evidence beyond our own intuitions and introspections that humans work that way?\nTwo Tips of the Iceberg\nIn the 1970s, Benjamin Libet, a physiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, wired up the brains of volunteers to an electroencephalogram and told the volunteers to make random motions, like pressing a button or flicking a finger, while he noted the time on a clock.\nDr. Libet found that brain signals associated with these actions occurred half a second before the subject was conscious of deciding to make them.\nThe order of brain activities seemed to be perception of motion, and then decision, rather than the other way around.\nIn short, the conscious brain was only playing catch-up to what the unconscious brain was already doing. The decision to act was an illusion, the monkey making up a story about what the tiger had already done.\nDr. Libet's results have been reproduced again and again over the years, along with other experiments that suggest that people can be easily fooled when it comes to assuming ownership of their actions. Patients with tics or certain diseases, like chorea, cannot say whether their movements are voluntary or involuntary, Dr. Hallett said.\nIn some experiments, subjects have been tricked into believing they are responding to stimuli they couldn't have seen in time to respond to, or into taking credit or blame for things they couldn't have done. Take, for example, the ''voodoo experiment'' by Dan Wegner, a psychologist at Harvard, and Emily Pronin of Princeton. In the experiment, two people are invited to play witch doctor.\nOne person, the subject, puts a curse on the other by sticking pins into a doll. The second person, however, is in on the experiment, and by prior arrangement with the doctors, acts either obnoxious, so that the pin-sticker dislikes him, or nice.\nAfter a while, the ostensible victim complains of a headache. In cases in which he or she was unlikable, the subject tended to claim responsibility for causing the headache, an example of the ''magical thinking'' that makes baseball fans put on their rally caps.\n''We made it happen in a lab,'' Dr. Wegner said.\nIs a similar sort of magical thinking responsible for the experience of free will?\n''We see two tips of the iceberg, the thought and the action,'' Dr. Wegner said, ''and we draw a connection.''\nBut most of the action is going on beneath the surface. Indeed, the conscious mind is often a drag on many activities. Too much thinking can give a golfer the yips. Drivers perform better on automatic pilot. Fiction writers report writing in a kind of trance in which they simply take dictation from the voices and characters in their head, a grace that is, alas, rarely if ever granted nonfiction writers.\nNaturally, almost everyone has a slant on such experiments and whether or not the word ''illusion'' should be used in describing free will. Dr. Libet said his results left room for a limited version of free will in the form of a veto power over what we sense ourselves doing. In effect, the unconscious brain proposes and the mind disposes.\nIn a 1999 essay, he wrote that although this might not seem like much, it was enough to satisfy ethical standards. ''Most of the Ten Commandments are 'do not' orders,'' he wrote.\nBut that might seem a pinched and diminished form of free will.\nGood Intentions\nDr. Dennett, the Tufts professor, is one of many who have tried to redefine free will in a way that involves no escape from the materialist world while still offering enough autonomy for moral responsibility, which seems to be what everyone cares about.\nThe belief that the traditional intuitive notion of a free will divorced from causality is inflated, metaphysical nonsense, Dr. Dennett says reflecting an outdated dualistic view of the world.\nRather, Dr. Dennett argues, it is precisely our immersion in causality and the material world that frees us. Evolution, history and culture, he explains, have endowed us with feedback systems that give us the unique ability to reflect and think things over and to imagine the future. Free will and determinism can co-exist.\n''All the varieties of free will worth having, we have,'' Dr. Dennett said.\n''We have the power to veto our urges and then to veto our vetoes,'' he said. ''We have the power of imagination, to see and imagine futures.''\nIn this regard, causality is not our enemy but our friend, giving us the ability to look ahead and plan. ''That's what makes us moral agents,'' Dr. Dennett said. ''You don't need a miracle to have responsibility.''\nOther philosophers disagree on the degree and nature of such ''freedom.'' Their arguments partly turn on the extent to which collections of things, whether electrons or people, can transcend their origins and produce novel phenomena.\nThese so-called emergent phenomena, like brains and stock markets, or the idea of democracy, grow naturally in accordance with the laws of physics, so the story goes. But once they are here, they play by new rules, and can even act on their constituents, as when an artist envisions a teapot and then sculpts it -- a concept sometimes known as ''downward causation.'' A knowledge of quarks is no help in predicting hurricanes -- it's physics all the way down. But does the same apply to the stock market or to the brain? Are the rules elusive just because we can't solve the equations or because something fundamentally new happens when we increase numbers and levels of complexity?\nOpinions vary about whether it will ultimately prove to be physics all the way down, total independence from physics, or some shade in between, and thus how free we are. Dr. Silberstein, the Elizabethtown College professor, said, ''There's nothing in fundamental physics by itself that tells us we can't have such emergent properties when we get to different levels of complexities.''\nHe waxed poetically as he imagined how the universe would evolve, with more and more complicated forms emerging from primordial quantum muck as from an elaborate computer game, in accordance with a few simple rules: ''If you understand, you ought to be awestruck, you ought to be bowled over.''\nGeorge R. F. Ellis, a cosmologist at the University of Cape Town, said that freedom could emerge from this framework as well. ''A nuclear bomb, for example, proceeds to detonate according to the laws of nuclear physics,'' he explained in an e-mail message. ''Whether it does indeed detonate is determined by political and ethical considerations, which are of a completely different order.''\nI have to admit that I find these kind of ideas inspiring, if not liberating. But I worry that I am being sold a sort of psychic perpetual motion machine. Free wills, ideas, phenomena created by physics but not accountable to it. Do they offer a release from the chains of determinism or just a prescription for a very intricate weave of the links?And so I sought clarity from mathematicians and computer scientists. According to deep mathematical principles, they say, even machines can become too complicated to predict their own behavior and would labor under the delusion of free will.\nIf by free will we mean the ability to choose, even a simple laptop computer has some kind of free will, said Seth Lloyd, an expert on quantum computing and professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nEvery time you click on an icon, he explained, the computer's operating system decides how to allocate memory space, based on some deterministic instructions. But, Dr. Lloyd said, ''If I ask how long will it take to boot up five minutes from now, the operating system will say 'I don't know, wait and see, and I'll make decisions and let you know.' ''\nWhy can't computers say what they're going to do? In 1930, the Austrian philosopher Kurt Gödel proved that in any formal system of logic, which includes mathematics and a kind of idealized computer called a Turing machine, there are statements that cannot be proven either true or false. Among them are self-referential statements like the famous paradox stated by the Cretan philosopher Epimenides, who said that all Cretans are liars: if he is telling the truth, then, as a Cretan, he is lying.\nOne implication is that no system can contain a complete representation of itself, or as Janna Levin, a cosmologist at Barnard College of Columbia University and author of the 2006 novel about Gödel, ''A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines,'' said: ''Gödel says you can't program intelligence as complex as yourself. But you can let it evolve. A complex machine would still suffer from the illusion of free will.''\nAnother implication is there is no algorithm, or recipe for computation, to determine when or if any given computer program will finish some calculation. The only way to find out is to set it computing and see what happens. Any way to find out would be tantamount to doing the calculation itself.\n''There are no shortcuts in computation,'' Dr. Lloyd said.\nThat means that the more reasonably you try to act, the more unpredictable you are, at least to yourself, Dr. Lloyd said. Even if your wife knows you will order the chile rellenos, you have to live your life to find out.\nTo him that sounds like free will of a sort, for machines as well as for us. Our actions are determined, but so what? We still don't know what they will be until the waiter brings the tray.\nThat works for me, because I am comfortable with so-called physicalist reasoning, and I'm always happy to leverage concepts of higher mathematics to cut through philosophical knots.\nThe Magician's Spell\nSo what about Hitler?\nThe death of free will, or its exposure as a convenient illusion, some worry, could wreak havoc on our sense of moral and legal responsibility. According to those who believe that free will and determinism are incompatible, Dr. Silberstein said in an e-mail message, it would mean that ''people are no more responsible for their actions than asteroids or planets.'' Anything would go.\nDr. Wegner of Harvard said: ''We worry that explaining evil condones it. We have to maintain our outrage at Hitler. But wouldn't it be nice to have a theory of evil in advance that could keep him from coming to power?''\nHe added, ''A system a bit more focused on helping people change rather than paying them back for what they've done might be a good thing.''\nDr. Wegner said he thought that exposing free will as an illusion would have little effect on people's lives or on their feelings of self-worth. Most of them would remain in denial.\n''It's an illusion, but it's a very persistent illusion; it keeps coming back,'' he said, comparing it to a magician's trick that has been seen again and again. ''Even though you know it's a trick, you get fooled every time. The feelings just don't go away.''\nIn an essay about free will in 1999, Dr. Libet wound up quoting the writer Isaac Bashevis Singer, who once said in an interview with the Paris Review, ''The greatest gift which humanity has received is free choice. It is true that we are limited in our use of free choice. But the little free choice we have is such a great gift and is potentially worth so much that for this itself, life is worthwhile living.''\nI could skip the chocolate cake, I really could, but why bother? Waiter!\nCorrection: January 4, 2007, Thursday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about the debate over free will misstated the location of Elizabethtown College, where Michael Silberstein, who commented on free will and popular culture, is a science philosopher. It is in Pennsylvania, not Maryland.

But Mr. Moullet, still working hard at 69, never attracted the international attention that turned his colleagues into the New Wave phenomenon of the 1960s. Mr. Moullet's aims seemed to remain as modest as his budgets, as he quietly and hilariously went about deconstructing the Hollywood genre films he loved in a series of minimalist, absurdist comedies.\nNot easy to see, even in France, several of Mr. Moullet's films have been gathered in a box set by the French company Blaq Out, and Facets Multimedia of Chicago will be distributing American versions of two double features from the set. ''The Smugglers'' (''Les Contrebandières,'' 1967) paired with ''A Girl Is a Gun'' (''Une Aventure de Billy le Kid,'' 1971) were released last week; ''Brigitte and Brigitte'' (1966) and ''Up and Down'' (''Parpaillon,'' 1993) will appear on Jan. 30.\nThe transfers are problematic, with the blurred movement that always means a quickie transfer from the European PAL video standard to American NTSC, and there are no English subtitles on ''A Girl Is a Gun,'' which is offered to non-French-speaking viewers only in a comically inept dubbed version, apparently approved by Mr. Moullet and meant as a tribute to the tacky dubbing of the American films he grew up on in France.\nAt his best, Mr. Moullet is a brilliantly funny critic, reducing the clichés of the war film (''The Smugglers'') or the western (''A Girl Is a Gun'') to a cranky minimalism in which a handful of characters struggle across harsh, mountainous landscapes while carrying out their genre-mandated duties with a minimum of enthusiasm and surface emotion.\nIn ''The Smugglers'' a cunning customs officer (Johnny Monteilhet) working the border that divides two warring nations gets a nice system going by forcing his two attractive lady friends (Françoise Vatel and Monique Thiriet) to move contraband back and forth in equal proportion. In some ways the film echoes ''Les Carabiniers,'' a similarly stripped-down, cynical parable directed by Mr. Moullet's close friend Jean-Luc Godard in 1963.\nBut Mr. Moullet pushes the absurdist elements even further, into the land of G. K. Chesterton and Luis Buñuel. At one point the characters start speaking in a nonsense language that seems borrowed from Lewis Carroll's ''Jabberwocky''(nicely rendered in the English subtitles provided by the critic Noel Burch).\nWith ''A Girl Is a Gun,'' Mr. Moullet stepped up to color, widescreen and a star holding down the lead (Jean-Pierre Léaud, of Truffaut's Antoine Doinel films). But this parody -- less of American westerns than of their already self-conscious Italian counterparts, flourishing at the time the film was made -- still makes comic hay of its pathetically reduced means.\nThe action takes place in dusty mountain passages, where Billy the Kid (Mr. Léaud, in striped pants and long hair that give him a distinct hippie look) encounters an attractive female traveler (Rachel Kesterber) and enlists her as his mule, unaware that she has her own reasons for going along. Somehow the plot builds to a climax borrowed from King Vidor's ''Duel in the Sun'' as the two protagonists wrestle in a cloud of dust.\nThe self-conscious simplicity of Mr. Moullet's style suggests children's drawings: his shots are largely blank fields onto which he has drawn some barely animated stick figures. The pacing is slow and deliberate; the stories are so slight that they barely exist, the characters so sketchy and one-dimensional that they strain to achieve the humanity of sock puppets.\nMr. Moullet is commenting on how low our expectations and requirements are for genre entertainment, but thinness as a joke eventually runs thin. Mr. Moullet's most satisfying achievements may be his short films, like ''Essai d'Ouverture'' (15 minutes of the filmmaker struggling to open a plastic bottle of Coca-Cola) or ''Le Ventre de l'Amérique'' (in which he wanders forlornly through a featureless Midwestern city). With luck, these too will see their day on DVD. Blaq Out/Facets Multimedia, $39.95, not rated.\nTwo With George Reeves\nThe kind of ''filmmaking degree zero'' that Mr. Moullet pursues in his work can be found in its naïve state in many movies that came from Hollywood's cost-conscious independent studios, collectively known as Poverty Row. George Reeves, the beloved Superman of the 1950s television show, was one of many actors who passed through Poverty Row (as well as one of the few who emerged from it), and two of his scrappier efforts have been paired for a ''George Reeves Double Feature'' from VCI Entertainment.\nMr. Reeves's lightly ironic, self-aware playing style, which was to serve him so well as Superman, is evident even in a film as hopeless as ''Jungle Goddess,'' a 64-minute feature from 1948 directed by the madly prolific B-movie veteran Lewis D. Collins. Teamed with another B-movie star, Ralph Byrd (the humorless Dick Tracy of Republic serials), Mr. Reeves plays a rogue pilot who discovers the long-lost daughter of an American millionaire living in the potted-palm depths of a back-lot jungle.\nShe (Wanda McKay) is rather enjoying her life as a white goddess, worshiped by a group of African-American extras who look very much as if they would rather be elsewhere, though the charms of Mr. Reeves and the promise of a new hat eventually lure her back to Western civilization.\nThe Reeves-Byrd chemistry might have been evident only to the producer Robert L. Lippert, but he reteamed them later that year in the even more impoverished ''Thunder in the Pines'' (1948). The only known directorial effort of one Robert Edwards, this rip-roaring outdoor adventure set among the logging camps of the Pacific Northwest looks to have been principally shot on a couple of cramped sets and then padded out with documentary material lifted from other sources.\nLike a Moullet film, it's almost hilariously inert, as the two lumberjack pals played by Mr. Reeves and Mr. Byrd compete for the attentions of a flighty French mail-order bride (Denise Darcel). Once again, Mr. Reeves dances through a film as if he were in the most elegantly directed comedy by Ernst Lubitsch or Mitchell Leisen.\nThe disc also contains three short documentaries and several articles on Mr. Reeves, including one by Lou Koza that points up the shortcomings in ''Hollywoodland,'' the recent film based on the ambiguities surrounding his death in 1959. VCI, $14.99, not rated.\nAlso Out This Week\nSNAKES ON A PLANE -- A phenomenon on the Internet, a flop in the theaters, a camp classic on DVD? Samuel L.

1815899	Raging Against the Dying Of the Good Old Ways	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE6D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	A nagging question may come to mind throughout the film ''A Fish Story,'' tonight on the PBS series ''Independent Lens'': Would anyone bother telling or watching this tale if it didn't lend itself to all those picturesque shots of weather-hardened men working the ocean?\nMaybe that's documentary-making blasphemy, but the truth is that the imperiled-way-of-life film is by now a well-worn genre. Plenty of old ways are in jeopardy these days, but only the photogenic need apply. Once the camera-friendly backdrop is selected, just find a few chatty locals to moan and groan, throw in some evil bureaucrats and start filming.\nThe better representatives of the genre, of course, do more than that. ''A Fish Story'' doesn't. It explores how fishing restrictions have affected the fishermen of Gloucester and Chatham, Mass., but it doesn't so much illuminate the issues as document how muddled they are. This may be the point of the filmmakers, Courtney Hayes and Tim Gallagher: that there are no easy answers. But are there ever? Here the approach feels a bit lazy.\nThis film does have some interesting moments when it explores the shifting nature of alliances in such battles. Thirty years ago fishing and environmental interests joined to oppose offshore oil exploration in New England, but more recently environmentalists' concerns about depleted fishing stocks have left some fishermen throwing around words like ''eco-terrorist.''\nThe film focuses on a lawsuit over the issue, brought in 2000 by environmental groups. As it moves forward, Chatham and Gloucester find themselves on opposite sides. Even the environmental groups split.\n''A Fish Story'' personifies all this through two women, both outspoken wives of fishermen: Shareen Davis in Chatham and Angela Sanfilippo in Gloucester. Ms. Sanfilippo has more screen time, but the film suffers by never holding her feet to the fire: what exactly do the Gloucester rebels want? To fish the ocean to death? She ends up sounding almost as platitudinous as Edward M. Kennedy, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, who puts in a brief, ridiculous appearance.\nIndependent Lens A Fish Story On most PBS stations tonight (check local listings).\nLois Vossen, series executive producer; Courtney Hayes and Tim Gallagher, filmmakers; ITVS (Independent Television Service), series producer.\nTELEVISION REVIEW
1815900	The Haze and the Tumult, Revisited	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Prime Green Remembering the Sixties By Robert Stone Illustrated. 229 pages. Ecco/HarperCollins. $25.95.\nWith fiction like ''Dog Soldiers'' (1974), Robert Stone emerged as one of the few novelists to capture the hallucinatory, apocalyptic madness of the late '60s, the maelstrom of youthful passion, heedless idealism and dangerous excess that characterized those years and presaged the social tumult to come as Woodstock gave way to Altamont, as happy hippiedom gave way to the Manson murders, as Kool-Aid acid tests gave way to what would become death-by-beverage in Jim Jones's Guyana a decade later.\nIndeed, the events of the '60s and '70s seemed so surreal, so beyond the imaginings of most novelists, that it tended to be the so-called new journalists like Michael Herr and Hunter S. Thompson -- not fiction writers -- who created the most visceral portraits of those times. Now, with ''Prime Green,'' Mr. Stone sets down his own memories of the '60s, creating an impressionistic, strobe-lighted picture of that era that serves as a kind of bookend to his early novels. ''Prime Green'' may not possess the immediacy and the kinetic energy of Tom Wolfe's renderings of Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters in ''The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.'' It may not possess the staccato brilliance of Joan Didion's ''White Album.'' But it does provide the reader with some trippy, Day-Glo snapshots of that decade.\nLiving life in the '60s as a series of Kerouacian road trips, Mr. Stone and his wife, Janice, moved from city to city, country to country, as whim and work dictated, and in retracing his peregrinations in this volume he gives us a magical mystery tour of the places that would form the backdrops for his novels.\nThere's the New Orleans of ''A Hall of Mirrors'': a place possessing an idiosyncratic dazzle of strangeness, a place, he says, where he would not have been surprised to see ''kabbalah angels and Mayan gardens'' materialize in the poorest parts of town. There's Northern California, where the culture wars are beginning to brew at Berkeley, and Steinbeck country is already yielding to the infant tentacles of the high-tech business that will become Silicon Valley. There's Hollywood about 1969, where it's ''saturnalia time,'' and people are partaking of ''a very grim feast of the meaningless,'' a city where partygoers are so whacked out on nitrous oxide that they don't seem to care if their children are ingesting the gas too. And there's Mexico, where the Stones, hanging out with Ken Kesey, witness the chemically enhanced spectacle that gives this book its title: ''Prime Green,'' the ''primal, primary, primo'' green light that explodes over the rain forests in the moments after dawn.\nIn recounting such adventures, Mr. Stone has a disconcerting way of hopscotching from incident to incident, memory to memory, often leaving the reader wanting more details and more follow-up. The same thing can be said of his portraits, which are fascinating as far as they go, but often trail off into sketchiness. We learn that Neal Cassady -- who would be immortalized in the works of Kerouac, Kesey and Mr. Stone -- lived on methamphetamines during his Mexican sojourn and ''never ate, never slept, and never shut up,'' but we never get a full-fledged picture of the man. And even Kesey, who makes numerous appearances in this book -- as novelist, as drug connoisseur, as would-be shaman and as the author's longtime pal -- remains something of an abstract, iconic figure, drawn from the middle distance.\nWhat Mr. Stone excels at is conjuring the mood of specific times and places, capturing the attitude he and his friends shared as well as the larger zeitgeist. He gives us the Lower East Side and Greenwich Village in the early '60s, when the Bowery was still lined with flophouses and ''roach-challenged bars,'' and when going to an artist's loft party was ''like going to a party in the subway.''\nHe gives us post-Carnaby Street London, where he introduced Kesey and his Hells Angels entourage to his Hampstead neighbors, who didn't seem terribly fazed. And he gives us Paris in the mid-'60s, when he and other impecunious writers camped out at ''Paris's premier English-language bookstore,'' sleeping among the second-story stacks and smoking some primo kef, bought from Algerian hustlers.\nMr. Stone belonged to a generation that grew up on Hemingway and Joyce (during a stint in the Navy he read ''Ulysses'' in his spare time aboard ship) and aspired to ''behave like the characters in French New Wave movies.'' Lenny Bruce and John Coltrane were touchstones for him and his friends in San Francisco, and back in New York, they hung out with the Abstract Expressionists at the Cedar Bar and listened to Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso read at the Seven Arts Gallery Coffee Shop.\nBy the end of the decade, as Mr. Stone tells it, poetry and art had given way to politics, and politics, for many of his friends, had taken a distinctly darker turn. By 1969, he writes, ''my closest friends seemed all in various ways involved with Maoism, as trade union lawyers, as therapists, and in other socially activist endeavors.''\nLike people who lived through the era after World War I, he says, his generation had a sense of witnessing one of history's hinge moments: ''One thing being around and being the right age in the '60s gave us,'' he writes, ''was the primary sensation of time's wheel. You could catch glimpses of the fourth dimension, now and then see the world turning.''\n''In our time,'' he adds, ''we were clamorous and vain. I speak not only for myself here, but for all those with whom I shared the era and what I think of as its attitudes. We wanted it all; sometimes we confused self-destructiveness with virtue and talent, obliteration with ecstasy, heedlessness with courage. Worshiping the doctrines of Hemingway as we did, we wanted constant grace under constant pressure, and stoicism before a disillusionment that somehow never went stale. We wanted to die well every single day, to be a cool guy and a good-looking corpse. How absurd, because nothing is free, and we had to learn that at last.''\nStill, he says, he would do little differently: ''We were the chief victims of our own mistakes,'' he writes. ''Measuring ourselves against the masters of the present, we regret nothing except our failure to prevail.''\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES
1815901	Exposed: Celebrities, Tabloids And Sleaze!	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E5D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	There is no role as delicious as a truly nasty, sneaky gossipmonger. Burt Lancaster shone as J. J. Hunsecker, the Walter Winchellesque villain of ''Sweet Smell of Success.'' George Sanders stole scenes as the poison pen Addison DeWitt in ''All About Eve,'' and Henry Daniell was weasel incarnate as Sidney Kidd, the editor of Spy magazine in ''The Philadelphia Story.''\nThen there is Courteney Cox.\nOn a new FX series that begins tonight, Ms. Cox, a ''Friends'' alumna, plays Lucy Spiller, the ruthless and relentless editor of Drrt, a celebrity gossip magazine.\nThe character is based, not so loosely, on Bonnie Fuller, the bold and relentless editor responsible for the success of Us Weekly and now Star magazine.\nYet in a part that cries out for flair and flared nostrils, Ms. Cox is strangely wooden and bland. ''Dirt'' provides a very literal, coloring-book interpretation of a tyrannical publishing diva: the wall art in Lucy's office is a giant Renaissance-style painting of nude figures twisting under the fiery torments of hell.\nIt's not fair to compare anyone with Meryl Streep as the icy magazine editor in ''The Devil Wears Prada.'' But the Devil in ''Dirt'' wears red satin, horns and a tail.\nMs. Cox's performance is not the only speed bump, but the series gets better as it goes along, mostly thanks to Ian Hart as Don Konkey, a tabloid photographer and functioning schizophrenic who hears voices as he works.\nDon is a compelling, well-rendered character, and there are some amusing moments and well-observed details in ''Dirt.''\nAs a satire of the cult of celebrity, though, the series is clumsy, weighed down by symbols and pseudo-apocalyptic frills that echo Nathanael West -- the Day Spa of the Locust.\nAn exposé works best when its target's inner workings are veiled. The public has few illusions left about how tabloids work.\nMel Gibson pummeled the subspecies by producing the inadvertently hilarious ''Paparazzi,'' a celebrity version of ''Death Wish,'' in which a movie star wreaks revenge on the photographers who pursue his family.\nBBC America recently ran a documentary called ''Paparazzi'' that also disabused viewers of any lingering impression that gossip rags are run by gentlemen and scholars.\nIt also helps if the victims command some sympathy. Only the most tenderhearted weep at the plight of billionaire movie stars in need of privacy. Except, of course, movie stars.\nMs. Cox and her husband, David Arquette, have their own production company called Coquette, and they are executive producers of ''Dirt.'' This kind of uxorious collaboration has scary precedents: Guy Ritchie directing his wife, Madonna, in a remake of ''Swept Away''; Ben Affleck starring with Jennifer Lopez in ''Gigli''; and Brad Hall working with his wife, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, on the sitcom ''Watching Ellie.''\n''Dirt'' is a labor of love about hate: vigilante filmmaking that allows Hollywood stars to fire back at the pestering paparazzi who stalk them.\nIt makes the most of its juicy Hollywood setting and even more of its premium-cable license to be licentious. Lucy is seen alone in bed, using a vibrator under black satin sheets. She blackmails a married basketball star with pictures that show him having sex with a prostitute, much of it unconventional, in and around a hot tub. Her gay brother has a tryst with a closeted action-adventure movie star.\nBut for all of the Deep-Throat details, ''Dirt'' takes a very shallow look at the shallowness of show business.\nLucy picks up a handsome young stranger in the valet parking zone by noting that he carries a book. ''You know nobody in Hollywood reads,'' she says. (Actually, it's the one place where everybody reads.) When the boy toy sums up his novel, ''this whole thing happens because the guy dips a cookie in some tea,'' she replies, ''it's not just any cookie, it's a madeleine.''\nHe is impressed. ''Wow,'' he exclaims. ''She is gorgeous and she's read Proust.'' But it's mainly the viewer who is taken aback at such an overused literary reference.\nNot that all clichés are bad, particularly when they hark back to ''The Bad and the Beautiful,'' a 1952 melodrama about the movie business that starred Lana Turner and Kirk Douglas.\nLucy, who is pressured by her flinty boss, Gibson Horne (Timothy Bottoms), to raise profits, sinks her claws into Holt McClaren (Josh Stewart), an ''actor's actor'' in the shadow of his famous movie star girlfriend, Julia Mallory (Laura Allen). Lucy offers Holt favorable press in exchange for gossip. Mr. Stewart, who has the velvety mumble and heavy-lidded looks of the young Sean Penn, is good even in the banal role of an actor who sells his soul for fame.\n''Dirt'' does not paint a rosy portrait of Hollywood, just a familiar one. Movie stars are self-absorbed hedonists who abuse alcohol and drugs. An actress with an unwanted pregnancy overdoses in her bathtub; a hot female movie star who wants a baby hires a surrogate to give birth so she can preserve her girlish figure; a Christian pop singer has a drug habit. Lucy has one rule: she won't publish unsubstantiated gossip and instead tramples over publicists, blackmails celebrities and bullies her underlings to get to the truth.\nYet the drama unfolds around this cold woman's surprisingly warm friendship with her unbalanced photographer, Don, a friend since their college newspaper days and the only person she seems to care about. Lucy helps Don stay on his medication, and he comes through at deadline with exclusives, from snapshots of a dead starlet in her coffin to a close-up on the singed face of a freebasing pop singer.\n''Dirt'' comes wrapped in pomposity and pretenses, but it can't help reveling in the profession it seeks to censure.\n''You and all your Hollywood pals read my magazines, you know every word is true,'' Lucy tells a look-alike for the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who in the show has a brief cameo as a movie mogul named Harvey. ''As much as you all hate to admit it,'' she says, ''you need me.''\nDirt FX, tonight at 10, Eastern and Pacific times; 9, Central time.\nCreated by Matthew Carnahan; Mr. Carnahan, Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Joel Fields, executive producers; Chris Long and Dave Flebotte, co-executive producers; Sally Robinson, consulting producer; Thea Mann, producer; Joe DeOliveira, associate producer. Produced by Sascha Schneider.\nWITH: Courteney Cox (Lucy Spiller), Ian Hart (Don Konkey), Josh Stewart (Holt McLaren), Jeffrey Nordling (Brent Barrow), Laura Allen (Julia Mallory), Timothy Bottoms (Gibson Horne) and Will McCormack (Leo Spiller).\nTELEVISION REVIEW\nCorrection: January 13, 2007, Saturday A television review on Jan. 2 about ''Dirt,'' on FX, referred incorrectly to the channel.

Among those who chose instead to stay indoors were the viewers of the 57th annual ''Red and White Song Contest,'' a New Year's Eve television special in Japan, who were surprised to see naked dancers on the nationally televised broadcast -- or so they thought. A troupe of dancers wearing flesh-colored bodysuits took the stage during a performance by the singer DJ Ozma, above, forcing the national broadcaster NHK to apologize to viewers for what appeared to be nudity, Reuters reported. The dancers looked topless and wore skimpy bikini-style bottoms, causing about 250 viewers to phone in and complain. ''The dancers were wearing bodysuits, but we apologize for any misunderstanding,'' a presenter announced toward the end of the show.\nStorm Troopers and Ewoks Invade Pasadena Yesterday's 118th Rose Parade featured George Lucas, the ''Star Wars'' creator, as the grand marshal. The parade, which preceded the Rose Bowl game between the University of Southern California and Michigan, began with an Air Force B-2 stealth bomber flyover that brought cheers from the hundreds of thousands of spectators lining the streets of Pasadena, Calif., The Associated Press reported. One highlight was the ''Star Wars Spectacular,'' celebrating the 1977 release of the first film in that sci-fi series. Darth Vader led 200 storm troopers, right, down Colorado Boulevard, while Ewoks swung from trees, and waterfalls ran down the side of the planet Naboo. The actress and singer Kristin Chenoweth performed with a troupe of dancers, and the actor James Garner, Jennifer Berry (Miss America 2006) and the basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar also made appearances.\nEfforts to Save A London Museum The Theater Museum in London, Britain's national museum of the performing arts, is scheduled to close to the public on Sunday after almost 20 years at its Russell Street location in Covent Garden. The museum, which is a branch of the Victoria and Albert and houses one of the world's largest collections of documents and artifacts related to theater, dance, opera and other performances, has been unable to secure financing for redevelopment. Though the collection itself is not in danger and will be placed in the Victoria and Albert collections center, the questions of when and where it will again be on display remain open. The impending closing has caused a protest and the creation of a group called Guardians of the Theater Museum, which is using its Web site (theatremuseumguardians.org.uk) to solicit names for an online petition to save the museum.\nKylie Minogue's Comeback Continues, in Britain The Australian singer Kylie Minogue rang in the new year with her first British show since recovering from breast cancer, Agence France-Presse reported. Ms. Minogue, 38, left, performed for 12,000 fans at Wembley Arena in London on Sunday night, beginning the British leg of her Showgirl Homecoming Tour. The show was her first in Britain since her cancer was diagnosed in May 2005, and she suspended the tour in Australia to undergo surgery, followed by chemotherapy. She resumed performances in her homeland in November and has six additional dates planned at Wembley, followed by six in Manchester. Ms. Minogue, whose hits include ''Can't Get You Out of My Head'' and ''I Believe in You,'' is Australia's biggest pop star, with an estimated 40 million records sold worldwide.\nArias in the Alehouse What better theme for a group of opera singers than Italian night? The baritones and sopranos of Opera on Tap will perform an Italian theme night at the Parkside Lounge on the Lower East Side tomorrow night at 8. The ensemble, which has been at Freddy's Bar and Backroom in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for the last year and a half, aims to make opera more accessible by presenting professional singers in casual environments. Members of Opera on Tap will appear for the first time at Galapagos Art Space in Brooklyn this month, with a ''Greatest Hits'' night on Jan. 21 at 8 p.m. The regular monthly gig at Freddy's continues, with a 9 p.m. show on Jan. 11. Information: operaontap.com.\nWhere Are They Now? It's not terribly difficult to find the latest news about Jennifer Hudson (she's in ''Dreamgirls,'' in case you haven't heard), Clay Aiken (gay? straight? diva?) or several other stars from previous seasons of Fox's hit show ''American Idol,'' but what have R. J. Helton, Julia DeMato, Jasmine Trias and dozens of other former contestants been doing? The Jan. 8 issue of US Weekly will include updates on more than 50 cast members from the first five seasons of the show. The news of who works construction in Nashville and who tends bar in Texas need keep hungry fans appeased for a only couple of weeks: Season 6 starts on Jan. 16. Jay Mohr, who was the host of NBC's ''Last Comic Standing'' for the first three seasons, and the actress Nikki Cox, of NBC's ''Las Vegas,'' were married on Friday night in Los Angeles, People magazine reported. Ms. Cox, 28, above with Mr. Mohr, was previously engaged to the comic Bob Goldthwait, but this is her first marriage. It is the second for Mr. Mohr, who was married to Nicole Chamberlain from 1998 to 2004.\nTheater Notes Yale Repertory Theater will present ''In the Continuum,'' written and performed by Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter, beginning on Jan. 12 at that New Haven theater. The production, which had a critically acclaimed Off Broadway run in the fall of 2005, is on an international tour. The York Theater Company will present ''Blind Lemon Blues,'' a new musical about Blind Lemon Jefferson, the Dallas street musician who went from singing on a street corner to a recording contract with Paramount Records. Mr. Jefferson made more than 80 recordings in the late 1920s. The limited engagement runs from Feb. 15 to 25 only, before the production heads off on a nine-city international tour. Spare Change productions will present ''The Dirty Talk'' by Michael Puzzo from Jan. 11 through Feb. 4 at Center Stage, New York. The production, directed by Padraic Lillis, was originally developed as part of the Labyrinth Theater Company's Barn series, and was first presented in the 2005 New York International Fringe Festival.
1815903	Pop Music And the War: The Sound Of Resignation	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E5D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	''I was a lover, before this war.'' Those are the first words sung on TV on the Radio's ''Return to Cookie Mountain,'' one of the most widely praised albums of 2006. Whatever the line means within the band's cryptic lyrics, it could also apply to the past year's popular music. Thoughts of romance, vice and comfort still dominated the charts and the airwaves. But amid the entertainment, songwriters -- including some aiming for the Top 10 -- were also grappling with a war that wouldn't go away.\nPop's political consciousness rises in every election year, and much as it became clear in November that voters are tired of war, music in 2006 also reflected battle fatigue. Beyond typical wartime attitudes of belligerence, protest and yearning for peace, in 2006 pop moved toward something different: a mood somewhere between resignation and a siege mentality.\nSongs that touched on the war in 2006 were suffused with the mournful and resentful knowledge that -- as Neil Young titled the album he made and rush-released in the spring -- we are ''Living With War,'' and will be for some time. Awareness of the war throbs like a chronic headache behind more pleasant distractions.\nThe cultural response to war in Iraq and the war on terrorism -- one protracted, the other possibly endless -- doesn't have an exact historical parallel. Unlike World War II, the current situation has brought little national unity; unlike the Vietnam era, ours has no appreciable domestic support for America's opponents. Iraq may be turning into a quagmire and civil war like Vietnam, but the current war has not inspired talk of generationwide rebellion (perhaps because there's no draft to pit young against old) or any colorful, psychedelically defiant counterculture. The war songs of the 21st century have been sober and earnest, pragmatic rather than fanciful.\nImmediate responses to 9/11 and to the invasion of Iraq arrived along familiar lines. There was anger and saber-rattling at first, particularly in country music; the Dixie Chicks' career was upended in 2003 when Natalie Maines disparaged the president on the eve of the Iraq invasion. There were folky protest songs about weapons and oil profiteering, like ''The Price of Oil'' by Billy Bragg; in a 21st-century touch, there were denunciations of news media complicity from songwriters as varied as Merle Haggard, Nellie McKay and the punk-rock band Anti-Flag.\nRappers, who were already slinging war metaphors for everything from rhyme battles to tales of drug-dealing crime soldiers, soon exploited the multitude of rhymes for Iraq, while some, like Eminem and OutKast, also bluntly attacked the president and the war.\nIn 2006 songwriters who usually stick to love songs found themselves paying attention to the war as well. ''A new year, a new enemy/Another soldier gone to war,'' John Legend sings in ''Coming Home,'' the song that ends his 2006 album, ''Once Again.'' It's a soldier's letter home, wondering if his girlfriend still cares. ''It seems the wars will never end, but we'll make it home again,'' Mr. Legend croons, more wishful than confident.\nJohn Mayer starts his 2006 album, ''Continuum,'' with ''Waiting on the World to Change,'' a pop-soul ballad defining his generation as one that feels passive because it's helpless: ''If we had the power to bring our neighbors home from war,'' he sings, ''They would never have missed a Christmas/No more ribbons on the door.'' The best he and they can do, he muses, doubtless to the disgust of more activist types, is to wait until ''our generation is gonna rule the population.''\nThere is more rage in the guitar onslaught of albums like Pearl Jam's politically charged, self-titled 2006 album. Contemplating the death of a soldier in ''World Wide Suicide,'' the song lashes out at a president ''writing checks that others pay,'' but ends up wondering, ''What does it mean when a war has taken over?'' And in ''Army Reserve,'' a wife and child wait: ''She tells herself and everybody else/Father is risking his life for our freedoms.'' The righteousness of old protest songs has been replaced by sorrow and malaise.\nAfter three years of war, bluster has toned down, even in country music. Merle Haggard, a populist who has always been skeptical of the war in Iraq, tersely insists, ''Let's get out of Iraq, get back on the track, and let's rebuild America first,'' on his most recent solo album, ''Chicago Wind.'' In another song on the album, Toby Keith, whose ''Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)'' was one of country's most bellicose war songs in 2002, joins Mr. Haggard for a duet, suggesting a reconsideration.\nLike the electorate, all pop can agree on across political lines is sympathy for the troops. Bruce Springsteen's ''We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions'' included an old song, ''Mrs. McGrath,'' about a soldier crippled in battle; the album's expanded edition added an updated version of a blunt Pete Seeger song from 1966, ''Bring 'Em Home.''\nOn the hawkish side, the country singer Darryl Worley had a 2003 hit, ''Have You Forgotten?,'' that justified the Iraq invasion as a reaction to 9/11. Now, he has a current Top 20 country hit that reiterates his support for the war but concentrates on its human cost, describing a returned soldier's post-traumatic stress in ''I Just Came Back From a War.''\nIn a song called ''Bullet,'' the rapper Rhymefest portrays a soldier who enlisted as a way to get scholarship money for college and dies ''with a face full of hollowtips.'' Even as cozy a singer as Norah Jones starts her next album, due this month, with ''Thinking About You,'' a song about a lover killed in combat.\nThere were plenty of other songs directly about the war in 2006. But beyond topicality, the war also seeped into popular music more obliquely. The year's best-selling country album, ''Me and My Gang,'' by Rascal Flatts, includes ''Ellsworth,'' a song about ''Grandma'' and her dead husband, a veteran who left behind ''his medals/A cigar box of letters.'' Gnarls Barkley's ubiquitous hit single, ''Crazy,'' is about self-destructive insanity: ''You really think you're in control? Well, I think you're crazy.''\nThoughts of mortality fill albums like ''The Black Parade,'' by My Chemical Romance, and ''Decemberunderground,'' by A.F.I. War isn't the only factor behind all the foreboding in current popular music, but it's certainly one.\nThe 2000s are not the late 1960s, culturally or ideologically, but the musical repercussions of the Vietnam War may hint at what comes next. As that war dragged on, the delirious late 1960s gave way to not only the sodden early 1970s of technique-obsessed rock and self-absorbed singer-songwriters, but also to a flowering of socially conscious, musically innovative soul, the music that John Legend and John Mayer now deliberately invoke. It's as if this wartime era has simply skipped the giddy phase -- which didn't, in the end, turn bombers into butterflies -- and gone directly to the brooding. The end of the Vietnam War in 1975 was quickly followed by the rejuvenating energy of punk and hip-hop; there's no telling what disengagement from Iraq might spark.\nMusic and the other arts, unlike journalism, don't echo the news. They can be counterweights and compensations, the fantasies that work out, rather than the facts that don't. In the weeks before Christmas, I started noticing that nearly every time I wandered into a store or heard holiday music from a radio, John Lennon's ''Happy Xmas (War Is Over)'' -- that chiming, purposefully optimistic song with the somber undercurrent -- was on the playlist. When even Muzak programmers are facing up to life during wartime, pop is no escape.\nMUSIC\nCorrection: January 3, 2007, Wednesday A music column yesterday about pop songs on war misstated the title of the song, about a lover killed in combat, that starts the Norah Jones album due out this month. It is ''Wish I Could'' -- not ''Thinking About You,'' which is the title of another song on the album.
1815904	A Road Through History, Paved in Spanish Tile	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E5D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	New Yorkers don't often meet up with tiles, outside subway stations or the shower. Tiles flourish, after all, at latitudes where palm trees grow and window shutters are needed to minimize abundant sunlight.\nValencia is just that sort of place. Perched on the Costa del Azahar of Spain, the orange blossom coast on the Mediterranean, the city started as a Roman military colony and was later conquered by the Visigoths. The legendary Castilian nobleman El Cid (a k a Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar) fought the Moors in Valencia in the 11th century. The city changed hands again in the 13th century, when the Aragons from the north took over.\nThis pileup of cultural influences can be detected early in ''Tile Design in Valencia: From the Middle Ages Through the Early 20th Century,'' a show at the Queen Sofía Spanish Institute in Manhattan. Organized by Dr. Jaume Coll Conesa, director of the Museo Nacional de Cerámica y Artes Suntuarias González Martí de Valencia, the exhibition features about 110 works drawn from Valencia museums. It moves at a swift clip through nearly eight centuries, demonstrating along the way the effects of Islam, Christianity and modernism on the ceramic tile tradition.\nThe earliest fragments, from the late 14th and early 15th centuries, grouped under the heading ''Mystic Geometry,'' exhibit the Muslim strain. The Spanish term for a glazed tile, azulejo, comes from the Arabic az-zulayj, ''little stone,'' and the use of math in the azulejos' arrangement and design is fitting, coming from the culture that invented algebra.\nThe Islamic influence is also evident in the subject matter. Sharia, or Muslim law, discouraged the representation of icons and images of the living, so intricate, often highly stylized abstract patterns were favored in the early tiles. One fragment, ''Olambrilla (insert tile) With Arabic Funerary Epitaph'' from the 1400s, features flowing Arabic text painted in blue against a white background.\nValencia was one of the most active Mediterranean ports in the 15th century, and its tiles were exported to places as far-flung as Egypt, Syria and Turkey. The biggest customer, however, was Italy, including the Vatican. Examples of Italian exports are in short supply here. Instead the exhibition focuses on a local 15th-century trend: the demand for tiles with heraldic crests, used to mark property. In addition to the usual roaring lions and cackling birds are intriguing tiles created for the Furriers Guild, featuring an instrument used for carding, and a tile showcasing the instrument of the Crossbowman's Guild.\nVibrant color arrived in the mid-16th century by way of Italy and the majolica ceramic tradition. By the 17th and 18th centuries Valencian craftsmen were producing elaborate, multitile scenarios featuring local martyrs, like ''Flagellation of St. Vincent Martyr,'' or large-scale compositions, like ''St. Joachim and the Virgin as a Child,'' or ''Holy Family'' from 1787, surrounded by a twisting vegetal border.\nThe show's largest work, which the catalog calls the most significant example of Valencian tile design in any museum, is a piece known as the Disdier Paving, from the Royal Family's Tile Factory of Valencia, made in 1808, the year Napoleon invaded Spain. It is a late Rococo fantasy of winged horses, charging knights and theatrical and mythical figures like Pan, Flora, Athena and Victory. Genre scenes featuring the culinary side of Valencia also flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. A wonderful panel of two bewigged figures, ''Serving Turrón and Chocolate,'' from around 1775 (turrón being the local nougat confection) has a duck dropping down from the sky to knock over a cup of chocolate.\nThe modern period rivaled the 14th and 15th centuries in importance for the tile industry in Valencia, partly because of demand for Spanish tiles in places like Southern California. Several early-20th-century examples reveal the rage for Art Nouveau, with its attenuated floral motifs.\nA stylized frieze of flamingos appears in one work, while another, with a ''neo-Arab'' design, brings the Valencian ceramic tradition nearly full circle. Art Deco panels and geometric compositions from the 1930s predict the wild designs found in Latin America a few decades later. A panel with early versions of Mickey Mouse is a nice example of proto-Pop.\nThe exhibition ends abruptly in the '30s, when Valencia's tile industry fell victim to the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). The catalog, which includes fine reproductions and essays that dryly rehearse the opening and closing of Valencia's many factories, says only that businessmen were reluctant after the war to invest in technological improvements to revive the tile industry.\nAfter all the space devoted to taxes and tariffs imposed by noblemen in earlier centuries, as well as to the arcane laws of tile production quotas, the catalog's omission of Generalissimo Franco, who ruled Spain until 1975, and his possible impact on the tile trade seems anticlimactic.\nThere is much to enjoy about ''Tile Design in Valencia,'' although it can feel at times like a walk through a tile showroom. A few photographs show works in what was probably their original positions, but over all the exhibition lacks the contextual material that would adequately describe how these fragments and panels looked and functioned in their intended applications.\n''Tile Design in Valencia'' also serves nicely as a brief analogue to the history of Western painting, running alongside the rise of the Baroque and Rococo, 19th-century genre painting and modernism, while demonstrating an early example of extreme multiculturalism with its Islamic, Christian and pagan strains. (Interlacing forms in the early tiles even resemble animal-style motifs from Ireland and Saxony, a similarity that perhaps creeps in as a result of the Visigoths.)\nThe difference between painting and tiles, of course, is functionality. Works here have served as everything from architectural decorations and floor coverings to funereal monuments, property markers and company advertisements. Despite the efforts of New York's craftsmen and designers, these tiles are considerably more artful than what can be found in the subway.\n''Tile Design in Valencia: From the Middle Ages Through the Early 20th Century'' continues through Feb. 1 at the Queen Sofía Spanish Institute, 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street; (212) 628-0420 or spanishinstitute.org.\nART REVIEW
1815905	Checking Out, in Style or in Turmoil	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	In a New Year's weekend bracketed by deaths, it turns out that it was sound, not pictures, that made shocking television.\nThe background noise in a camera-cellphone recording of Saddam Hussein's execution -- jostling and sectarian insults -- belied the Iraqi government's portrait of the hasty hanging as a cool, considered meting of justice.\nThe accompanying dark and blurry shot of the Iraqi dictator falling though the gallows' trapdoor -- shown in its two-minute entirety on the Internet but not on most television news programs -- was about as distinct as a sonogram. It was an unsettling sight, but not really all that graphic or gruesome.\nIt was more the idea of watching Mr. Hussein die -- a snuff reality show -- that spooked many viewers. It certainly gave news directors pause. But the first images of the execution, filmed by Iraqi officials and shown within hours on Iraqi and American television, came without the ambient sounds that defined his final moments.\nNetworks and cable news outlets hesitated briefly about showing the unexpurgated version after it began ricocheting around the Internet on Sunday. But most news programs showed at least some of it. The tape turned out to hold redeeming -- and damning -- news value: it suggested to viewers that the execution that President Bush initially described as ''an important milestone'' in Iraq's advance toward democracy was actually more of a millstone.\nNext to the screams and confusion around the gallows in Baghdad, the slow, stately processions in honor of former President Gerald R. Ford seemed almost on mute. As well-wishers lined up to pass before his flag-covered coffin, lying in state in the Capitol rotunda, the only sound came from marine guards' high-gloss shoes squeaking on the polished marble floor.\nSmall wonder CNN kept going back to snippets of ''Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine, Pt. 1,'' sung at the raw, boisterous tribute to James Brown in Augusta, Ga. Michael Jackson stood onstage like a bereaved relative, and the Rev. Al Sharpton stepped up as mourner in chief, giving instructions to St. Peter. ''You need to open up the gates for the Godfather,'' he thundered. Mr. Brown's music was the unofficial soundtrack of the era when Mr. Ford was in office (Mr. Brown sang ''Say It Loud -- I'm Black and I'm Proud'' at President Richard M. Nixon's inaugural festivities in 1969), so those incongruous segues made poetic sense.\nSome of the most startling images of the new year were the ones meant to distract and entertain. As he did last year, a frail Dick Clark, 77, took a seat in ABC's Times Square studio to preside over his signature holiday special, ''Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve.''\nRyan Seacrest, a Dick Clark Mini-Me and the host of ''American Idol,'' actually led the show. But despite a 2004 stroke that left him in a wheelchair and his speech impaired, Mr. Clark, wearing a tuxedo jacket with shiny lapels, made brief cameos. His voice was slurred and his face gaunt and waxy, but he smiled gamely as he introduced Christina Aguilera and called out the countdown to midnight.\nTelevision has little patience with the aging and not much time for stroke victims, so it was both reassuring and painful to see Mr. Clark struggling to still fit into his nickname, ''America's oldest teenager.''\nAnyone who thinks that elderly entertainers can gracefully retire and surrender the limelight don't know anything about show business. As usual, the hardest-working man in it said it best.\nIn an interview he gave in 1989 while in prison for, among other things, a PCP-fueled high-speed car chase, Mr. Brown was asked how he was feeling.\n''I'm well rested,'' the singer replied. ''But I miss being tired.''\nTHE TV WATCH
1815906	Pirates, Penguins and Potboilers Rule the Box Office	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE5D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	A year after Hollywood rediscovered weighty political and social issues in movies like ''Syriana,'' ''Crash'' and ''Brokeback Mountain,'' the box office story of 2006 was that moviegoers finally said, ''Enough.''\nThey showed no appetite for a critique of their eating habits in ''Fast Food Nation.'' They weren't ready to fly along on ''United 93,'' no matter how skilled its exposé of homeland insecurity. They didn't care to see combat or suffer its after-effects in ''Flags of Our Fathers.'' And even Leonardo DiCaprio couldn't interest them in touring the ravaged Africa of ''Blood Diamond.''\nWhile Al Gore's prophecies in ''An Inconvenient Truth'' produced a respectable $24 million for Paramount, it was the message-movie exception that proved the rule. The big money was to be made making people laugh, cry and squeeze their dates' arms -- not think.\n''What worked was classic, get-away-from-it-all entertainment,'' said Rob Moore, Paramount's marketing and distribution chief. ''What didn't was things that were more challenging and esoteric.''\nComedy, animation and adventure, all with a PG-13 rating or tamer -- and for young adults, R-rated horror flicks -- were the escapist recipe for success.\nReminding moviegoers of what was on the news, and in an election year at that, only turned them off. (Unless it was on the news nine years ago, as in ''The Queen.'')\nWhile Disney's ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' set a new opening-weekend record and topped the box office tables with $423 million, the winner among studios was Sony Pictures, which said it would end the year with nearly $1.7 billion domestically -- besting its own industry record -- and $3.3 billion overseas.\nIn an off year for its Spider-Man franchise, Sony managed to win a record 13 weekends, led by Adam Sandler (''Click''); Will Ferrell (''Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby''); an animated hit (''Open Season''); James Bond (''Casino Royale,'' which has grossed $155 million, a franchise record); and Will Smith (''The Pursuit of Happyness'').\nMr. Smith's film broke $100 million, and he appears to have bolstered his stature as Hollywood's man who can do no wrong, a bankable star in dramatic, romantic, comedic or action roles.\n(When actors play against type, however, it can be deadly, as Russell Crowe showed in Ridley Scott's film ''A Good Year,'' for 20th Century Fox. Coming after his nose dive in ''Cinderella Man,'' Mr. Crowe's belly-flop raised questions about his status as a top box office draw.)\nThen there was what Jeff Blake, Sony's marketing and distribution czar, called ''that rare adult blockbuster,'' Ron Howard's ''Da Vinci Code.'' Fans of the book ignored the film's reviews, and it grossed $218 million.\n''Really, we brought the adults back to the movies this year, which is part of the reason why we're doing so much better,'' Mr. Blake said of the industry, tipping his hat to Warner Brothers' ''Departed'' and 20th Century Fox's ''Devil Wears Prada.''\nSony also got a boost from its Screen Gems unit; four of its horror films opened at No. 1. Typical was ''When a Stranger Calls,'' made for just $15 million, which grossed $48 million domestically.\nOver all, the top tier of the box office held its usual contours: 5 blockbusters exceeded $200 million, and 12 fell in the $100 million to $200 million zone. In addition, 39 exceeded $50 million, 7 more than in 2005. Total domestic box office reached $9.4 billion, a shade shy of the 2004 record but 5 percent more than in 2005, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Media by Numbers, which tracks box office results. Attendance was up 3.3 percent.\nNo. 2 Disney had its second-best year ever worldwide, with more than $3.27 billion internationally, and exceeded $1 billion domestically for the 10th time, thanks largely to ''Pirates'' and the year's No. 2 movie, Pixar's ''Cars,'' with $244 million.\nMark Zoradi, who runs marketing and distribution for Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, said basic entertainment had proved to be the cure for the industry's woes. ''People love to go to the movies to laugh, to feel emotion and cry,'' he said. ''That's why 'Cars' is so big. It wasn't a straight-out slapstick comedy. At its core, it was an emotional movie with comedy in it.''\nThe slate of movies at year's end was much stronger than on the same weekend a year earlier: up 10 percent in the aggregate, and 12 percent when comparing just the top 12 grosses. Fox's ''Night at the Museum,'' the Ben Stiller comedy, led the field, raking in $38 million for a total so far of $117 million.\nAmong animated films, Fox's ''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' came in at No. 2, nearly hitting $200 million. Bruce Snyder, president for domestic distribution, said Fox had been wise to get its movie into theaters well before the deluge of more than a dozen other computer-animated movies about animals.\nOne that suffered was Warner's ''Ant Bully,'' which was sandwiched between Sony's ''Monster House'' and Paramount's ''Barnyard'' and came away with just $28 million in sales. Paramount, too, might have regretted the title of its ''Flushed Away,'' which cost $150 million but grossed only $62 million. ''Happy Feet'' was a much-needed big hit for Warner, which had been less than overjoyed by the $200 million gross of ''Superman Returns.''\nDespite the animation glut, the potential payoffs -- Paramount's ''Over the Hedge'' grossed $155 million, and ''Happy Feet'' reached $176 million on Sunday -- are huge enough to make this a recurring phenomenon.\nFor Fox 2005 was a strong year; ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' was the No. 3 movie, at $234 million, and Meryl Streep's performance turned a formulaic comedy into a worldwide hit in ''Prada.'' Fox also had the year's most original film, ''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,'' which was made for less than $20 million and grossed more than $125 million.\nAmong thought-provoking movies, ''Flags of Our Fathers'' showed how treacherous it can be to open an Oscar contender in September or October. While ''The Departed'' was a hit, ''All the King's Men,'' ''Hollywoodland'' and ''Running With Scissors'' all bombed. Back-to-school audiences much preferred Lions Gate's ''Saw III.''\nWarner missed, meanwhile, with ''Blood Diamond,'' a big action movie that also had something to say. Alan Horn, the studio's president, said he thought the film had managed the feat, but audiences didn't, and the film has grossed $36 million so far.\n''The audience is telling us that either they want lighter fare, and they just don't want to go there and have a movie as thematically heavy as 'Blood Diamond' is, or it's the quality of the movie,'' he said.\nAudiences apparently weren't eager to read, either. With directors like Clint Eastwood, Alejandro González Iñárritu and Mel Gibson pushing for authenticity, the studios wound up releasing subtitled movies that were shot largely or entirely in Japanese, Moroccan, Mexican, Mayan and Russian. But even Brad Pitt couldn't draw big crowds for ''Babel,'' and the Fox Searchlight release of the Russian blockbuster ''Night Watch'' proved that some cultural exchanges will remain a one-way street.\nIt remains to be seen whether ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' Mr. Eastwood's critically adored Japanese companion piece to ''Flags,'' could lure sizable audiences once it expands from a micro-release.\nFifth-place Paramount was cheered by the low-budget comedies ''Jackass Number Two'' and ''Nacho Libre,'' but was counting for redemption on ''Dreamgirls,'' which opened to packed houses on Christmas Day. In just 852 theaters, the movie grossed $38.5 million through New Year's weekend, and the studio was counting on Oscar attention to make it a megahit.\nUniversal, in a leadership transition, struggled to fill a gaping hole in its slate. The studio hasn't released a movie that it made since August, and won't have one till April. (''The Good Shepherd,'' its lone prestige release at year's end, was financed by Morgan Creek.) Its biggest movie was ''The Break-Up,'' at $118 million, but more typical were duds like ''Miami Vice,'' ''Man of the Year,'' ''Let's Go to Prison,'' and ''The Black Dahlia.''\nNew Line's year, finally, was summed up by ''Snakes on a Plane,'' a trip you'd want to forget, as long as you could survive it. The studio's standout performers were ''Final Destination 3'' and ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning.'' New Line's stab at exploiting the religious Christian market, ''The Nativity Story,'' cost $35 million, but grossed just $37 million.\nBy comparison, a tiny proselytizing football movie called ''Facing the Giants,'' made for just $100,000 by a Southern Baptist congregation in Georgia, grossed $10 million in a limited release.\nCorrection: January 4, 2007, Thursday An article in The Arts on Tuesday about the most popular movies of 2006 and others that did not do as well at the box office referred incorrectly to two languages spoken in ''Babel,'' one of the films with subtitles that did not draw big crowds. They are Spanish and Berber, not ''Mexican'' and ''Moroccan.''

For $10.95 a day, Avis will issue motorists a notebook-size portable device that plugs into a car's power supply and delivers a high-speed Internet connection.\nFor the moment, the service is intended for business travelers. But Autonet sees its service appealing to families traveling with their children, although its unit is expected to cost $399, about twice as much as current cellular card technology, plus $49 a month for service.\nA mobile Wi-Fi hotspot that lets laptops and personal digital assistants link to the Internet without the benefit of wires represents an important step toward what technology experts call the ''connected car.''\n''This shows us a glimpse of where we will be in the future,'' said Roger Entner, a wireless telecommunications analyst at Ovum, a consulting firm based in London.\nUsers of these new Wi-Fi hotspots still must contend with technological limitations, like bandwidth restrictions and, for vehicles with too few auxiliary power outlets for all passengers who want to be online at the same time, battery consumption.\nAvis said it planned to make a formal announcement on the technology within a week but declined to comment for this article.\nSterling Pratz, the president and chief executive of Autonet, said the device uses the 3G cellular network and will work in all major metropolitan areas and in about 95 percent of the country.\nMr. Pratz said his technology minimized dropped connections but did not eliminate them, and noted that the In-Car-Router had been modified to reduce battery consumption. ''In our testing, customers have told us that battery life isn't an issue because people have been able to plug their devices into the car's power supply,'' he said.\nQuestions about the legality of operating a vehicle with a Wi-Fi hotspot onboard are also likely to be raised, according to analysts. Thomas Dickerson, the author of ''Travel Law'' (Law Journal Press, 2007) said it would be ''easy to see that a technology like this could change the way people drive, because this could take people's attention off the road.''\nAutonet saidthe service was for passengers and that Avis would require renters to agree not to hold it liable for accidents resulting from irresponsible use.
1815909	And You Thought Snow Globes Were Harmless Decorations	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E4D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	To paraphrase a classic line from Lily Tomlin, I worry that the person who thought up the rules for carrying liquids and gels on airplanes last year is busy thinking up something new this year.\nThe thought arises partly because of a scene just after Christmas at an airport security checkpoint, where a half-dozen festive snow globes -- like the ones with Frosty the Snowman in a liquid-filled glass globe that simulates snowfall when you shake it -- were lined up on a counter.\nWasn't that nice! The Transportation Security Administration had decorated the checkpoint! But as it turned out, Frosty and his co-conspirators had actually been busted -- confiscated from passengers' carry-on bags pursuant to the following notification by the security administration:\n''Snow globes, regardless of size of amount of liquid inside, even with documentation, are prohibited in your carry-on.''\nNow, I am not sure what exactly constitutes a documented snow globe. But I do know that the snow globe rule has intensified ridicule of airport security, and that cannot be a good thing.\nThe shift began in August. That's when an apparent terrorist plot in London to use liquid explosives on airplanes bound for the United States led security officials to proclaim bewildering new regulations.\nBanned were all liquids and gels. Then came modifications. Gel-filled bras were O.K. and then so was infant formula, if accompanied by an actual baby. Then it became O.K. to bring on board liquids and gels, provided each was in a container of not more than three ounces, and all containers were neatly displayed in a quart-size zipper-lock bag.\nNow, the Homeland Security Department obviously believes that the vaguely outlined August plot was serious enough to justify cracking down on liquids and gels.\n''This was, by any measure, the most sophisticated plot against the United States that came near to fruition since Sept. 11,'' the Homeland Security secretary, Michael Chertoff, said in a recent speech.\nBut the plot seems to have been thwarted before the bad guys reached the airport, because of intelligence and police work, not a focus on rummaging through carry-on bags for bottles of shampoo.\n''If you look at the London plot, assuming it was a plot, no security measure then in place would have caught it at an airport,'' said Bruce Schneier, an authority on security technology and the author of the book ''Beyond Fear.''\nMetal detectors spot weapons -- assuming the screener is not preoccupied with shampoo.\nInherent in the obsession on liquids and gels, Mr. Schneier said, ''is the notion that we can stop the bad guys by focusing on tactics, which is moronic. I pick a defense, you see my defense, and then you, the bad guy, decide what to do. That's a game we can't win.''\nHe added, ''Screeners are so busy looking for liquids that they've missed decoy bombs in tests. We've defined success so weirdly. When T.S.A. takes away some frozen tomato sauce from grandmom because it might become a liquid, they think of it as a success. But that's a failure. It's a false alarm.''\nIt is easy to ridicule the security agency's carry-on procedures, which are continually being revised -- partly, Mr. Schneier argues, because of politics. ''Did you know they have special rules for monkeys?''\nThey do. Like dogs, some specially trained monkeys are classified as service animals to assist handicapped people. But you really have to wonder if these sample sentences -- from the security administration's rules for how transportation security officers at walk-through metal detectors should handle monkeys -- were written with a straight face:\n''When the handler and the monkey go through the W.T.M.D. and the W.T.M.D. alarms, both the handler and the monkey must undergo additional screening.'' The rules add that security officers ''have been trained not to touch the monkey during the screening process'' and that ''the inspection process may require that the handler take off the monkey's diaper as part of the visual inspection.''\nJokes are easy, like Mr. Schneier's crack on having to remove shoes: ''It's a good thing the shoe bomber wasn't an underwear bomber.''\nBut security is deadly serious, and Mr. Schneier and other experts in the field have been saying for years that the best security is smart, diligent intelligence, not confiscating snow globes or lip gels, which he derides as ''security theater, not real security.''\nHe added, ''We spent billions on security to make the bad guys make minor modifications in their tactics. Focusing on the tactics only works if you happen to guess correctly.''\nON THE ROAD
1815910	Itineraries; The Hasty Hello	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E4D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Business groups are stealing a page from the modern dating handbook by playing host to ''speed networking'' events in which professionals move methodically from one business prospect to the next, getting acquainted for just a few minutes at a time.\nIt is the corporate equivalent of speed dating, invented in the late 1990s by a rabbi hoping to fix up Jewish singles, a practice that has since spread widely.\n''You won't have time to make a business deal in eight minutes, but you'll gather a great list of people that you might work with in the future,'' said Tom Jaffee, founder of Match Events (matchevents.com), which organizes social and business meet-ups from its headquarters in Delray Beach, Fla.\nSome speed networking events use the same round robin approach as speed dating, so the participants meet random people in an orderly way. A few companies like Match Events and eXtreme Networking, which is based in Chicago and operates Speednetworking.com, use software to help make the perfect business match.\nFor this more advanced type of speed networking, those attending the event fill out profiles detailing their job description, title and industry, and specifying the types of people they would like to meet. For example, attendees may hope to meet new suppliers or customers, or service providers like payroll or legal professionals.\nThe profiles and requests are then matched up electronically, and a personalized list is generated for each participant. At the speed networking event, numbered stations are set up around the room, with attendees chatting successively with each person on their list at the assigned station, typically for five to eight minutes each. In this way, attendees meet a wide selection of people.\nStaffing Industry Analysts of Los Altos, Calif., an organizer of conferences and trade shows, has included speed networking in some of its programs for two years. Barry Asin, its executive vice president and chief analyst, says the company has tried a variety of ways to get people together at such events.\n''We've set up tables by discussion topic or industry and let people choose where to sit,'' he said. ''We've done the cocktail hours and lunches, and they're fine. But with speed networking, there's always an incredible buzz in the room. People are excited and full of energy.''\nAaron Abend, president of the Viapoint Corporation, a software company in Burlington, Mass., says he wishes that all professional conferences included speed networking. He recalled flying across the country to an Oracle database conference, in search of companies that might distribute his customer relationship management software.\nLooking for a table of prospective partners, he ended up sitting with employees of the Food and Drug Administration who were at the conference solely to learn about features in Oracle's software, and had no interest in his product. ''We could do nothing for each other, and the meal was a total waste of time,'' he said, ''but it would have been too rude to get up and leave.''\nThe best time for a speed networking session is right after the first morning keynote speech, Mr. Jaffee said. ''A session early in the overall program connects people, and that energy carries over to the rest of the sessions because folks see potential to do business with the people they've met,'' he said. ''Plus it gives them the rest of the conference to see each other again.''\nThe format is not for everyone. Speed networking may feel uncomfortable to those less confident in social situations, as they have to introduce themselves over and over. Some attendees may feel too rushed to absorb information. And if the room is not set up well, acoustics may hamper one's hearing because of the many simultaneous conversations.\nWhile attendees often have a list of people they want to meet, some also keep a list of people they want to avoid. Some software systems that organize speed networking events offer a ''no meet'' guarantee, which gives participants the option to list a person, company or profession they do not want to be matched with. ''That helps alleviate the number of uncomfortable pairings,'' said Adam Fendelman, chief executive of eXtreme Networking.\nFeedback from conference organizers and attendees is used to improve the matching software. ''At a large conference people may want to choose by multiple criteria, or make sure they don't meet the same people they met at last year's event,'' Mr. Fendelman said.\nThe Columbia Business School used speed networking in its Executive M.B.A. partnership programs with the University of California, Berkeley, and the London School of Business. ''It provided some social engineering to help students to meet people in other classes and programs,'' said Jessica Roberts, the student affairs officer for the program.\nBoth Mr. Jaffee and Mr. Fendelman say they expect more conferences to incorporate speed networking as event managers learn about the concept. ''When you're asking people to travel and pay a lot of money, a good keynote and a bag of goodies isn't enough anymore,'' Mr. Fendelman said.
1815911	Kicking an Addiction, With Real People	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E4D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Smokers are lectured enough by nonsmokers, so some advertisers say the best way to persuade people to give up cigarettes is to tell the stories of other smokers.\nWhen GlaxoSmithKline was casting for commercials for its NicoDerm patches last year, the actors were required to be smokers or former smokers.\nGlaxo is taking the approach one step further in a new campaign featuring four people from the Los Angeles area who use the company's Commit nicotine lozenges to help them stop smoking. Taking a cue from the consumer-generated content craze, Glaxo gave Lisa, Keith, Matt and Kim video cameras to tape themselves narrating their effort to quit over 13 weeks early last year. (Glaxo is not disclosing their last names because of privacy concerns.) The tapes were edited by professionals and will be shown on TV, on the Internet and in a movie-length documentary that is being submitted to film festivals.\n''It's easy to tell when someone's not a smoker when they're just acting or pretending, and smokers suss that out,'' said John Staffen, chief creative officer of Arnold New York, a Havas agency that worked with Glaxo on the Commit ads. ''Smokers really relate to each other. A smoker to smoker dialogue is really important.''\nAntismoking ads have changed a lot from the days when commercials gloomily listed health risk after health risk in an attempt to persuade smokers they should quit. Most smokers already know they should quit, and they usually try to do so eight times before they succeed, according to the American Legacy Foundation, a nonprofit group that fights smoking.\nMessages from real people seem to be more persuasive to smokers, the foundation says. In 2006, the foundation continued its Truth campaign aimed at deterring teenagers from smoking with documentary-style commercials featuring a bushy-haired young man investigating the tobacco industry in an aggressive but funny manner.\n''Health effects are less of a motivator for youth,'' said Cheryl Healton, chief executive of the foundation. ''But, for them, social conscience is a motivator.''\nThe foundation is running a campaign urging smokers to ''become an ex.'' Radio and TV spots in six cities feature real smokers craving cigarettes. In one commercial, a woman imagines herself jumping out of a window just to snag a cigarette. The foundation has also set up a Web site for an online community where smokers can interact with one another as they try to quit.\nMs. Healton said pharmaceutical ads for products to help smokers quit should not emphasize the products' brands.\nCommit is featured at the end of each commercial, and, in some spots, Lisa talks about how grateful she is for Commit. Glaxo intended to focus on the stories of the smokers rather than on its products, said Bill Slivka, vice president of smoking control for GlaxoSmithKline's consumer and health care division.\nLisa's story will appear on TV first. A 36-year-old from Burbank, Calif., Lisa started smoking 15 years ago because she thought she looked cool blowing smoke rings. She decided to quit for her husband and daughter.\nGlaxo, like most other advertisers, is finding it harder to reach consumers, said John Wojcik, the brand manager for Commit. In the past, Glaxo would have chosen a target audience and then scattered its commercials throughout a long list of programs that fit that demographic. With Lisa's story, Glaxo has chosen specific programs where new versions of the sequential commercials will air each week. Glaxo is hoping Lisa's story will draw a loyal following, Mr. Wojcik said.\n''It's our way to kind of deal with the fragmented U.S. market,'' he said.\nKeith, a 42-year-old who smoked a pack and a half for 31 years, tells his story in Webisodes on Commit's site. During the 12 weeks that people use Commit, Keith relapsed once and started smoking again. Glaxo decided to retain that footage because Keith ended up quitting again successfully.\nThere was a fifth person originally in the project, but he did not give up cigarettes in the end. That smoker will not be featured in any Commit ads or the Commit documentary.\nThe company periodically checks in on the four who successfully quit smoking, said Mr. Slivka. So long as Kim and Matt do not start smoking again, Glaxo may air their footage next.\nMr. Slivka of Glaxo pointed out that Kim and Matt had been nicotine-free for almost a year and said that once people stay away from cigarettes for more than a month, the battle gets much easier.\n''I think there's good potential for Kim and Matt to remain smoke-free,'' he said.\nADVERTISING
1815912	It Takes Good Acting to Hide Travel Stress	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E4D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	WHEN someone is auditioning for a part in a theatrical production, I can usually tell if they're right for the role in a minute or less. How can I know so quickly?''\nCasting 40 shows a year helps. But I have another secret: I travel a lot. On the road, you see some of the best acting. And the worst.\nFlight attendants are the best actors, hands down. On a trip from New York to Los Angeles not too long ago, a passenger seated across from me decided to get himself drunk, and the attendant was onto him.\n''When you get a chance ?'' he would say whenever she passed by his seat.\n''As soon as I have time,'' she would say.\nFinally, after serving him his fifth Bloody Mary, she cut him off. ''I'm really sorry,'' she said. ''We have a limit.'' She wasn't sorry. But she made him think she was. That's great acting.\nIf you want to see bad acting, just hang out next to the gate on an oversold flight. When there's only one seat left and several passengers vying for it, you get a lot of drama.\nThere's always the guy in the power suit who growls, ''Do you know who I am?''\nThere's someone with a sob story who is going to visit a long-lost relative. Usually, the family member is old or dying, or both. It's not very believable.\nSometimes, people are most convincing when they are silent. On a stopover in Charlotte a few months ago, a young woman near me looked like a model on her way to a fashion shoot in Milan. With her long scarf and sunglasses, she turned heads as she walked through the terminal.\nThen she flipped out her cellphone. ''Aunt Ada?'' she said, with a heavy Southern drawl. ''I'm at the airport now. Looks like I'll be landing in Spokane on time.''\nFrom Audrey Hepburn to Daisy Duke in less than 10 seconds.\nI try to not to offer advice, but sometimes I can't help myself. Earlier this year, while I was in New York for an acting competition, I caught a cab across town. When the driver found out what I was doing, he said, ''You know, I've always wanted to be an actor.''\nI spent the rest of the trip listening to Shakespeare monologues. He had a gorgeous voice -- deep, rich and utterly mesmerizing. I told him he had what it took, and encouraged him to pursue his dream.\nSo who are the worst actors? As a group, I would have to say it is car rental company employees. They're not very charismatic and they hardly ever look you in the eye. All they seem to care about is processing your paperwork, handing you the keys and moving on to the next customer.\nMaybe they're in dire need of acting lessons, but as a public service, I've decided not to volunteer. Why try to fool customers into thinking they're interested in their satisfaction? Besides, there are already enough actors out there trying to break into show business.\nFREQUENT FLIER E-mail: elliott@nytimes.com

The Eclipse 500 cost $1.52 million in 2006.\nThe first model was delivered to its co-owners, David Crowe and Jet-Alliance, a shared-jet operator in Westlake Village, Calif. Mr. Crowe and Jet-Alliance will share use of the plane. Eclipse said that it has 37 aircraft in various stages of assembly and has an order backlog of about 2,500.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has estimated that as many as 5,000 very light jets will be in operation within 10 years.\nTRANSATLANTIC BUSINESS AIRLINE -- A new discount, all-business-class transatlantic airline, L'Avion, plans to begin six-day-a-week service between Liberty International Airport in Newark and Orly in Paris.\nThe airline will fly the route with a 757-200 aircraft outfitted with 90 business-class seats. L'Avion was taking bookings yesterday on its Web site, www.lavion.com, for flights starting tomorrow.\nThe company offered round-trip fares of $999 for the first 1,000 customers who booked, but L'Avion said regular roundtrip fares will start at $1,599.\nTwo all-business-class, low-fare airlines, Eos and MaxJet, began flying the New York-London Stansted routes just over a year ago, and another all-business-class low-fare start-up, Silverjet, plans to begin service between Newark and London Luton later this month.\nAll of the start-ups offer fares sharply lower than the typical $9,000 walk-up business-class fares on most major transatlantic carriers.\nJOE SHARKEY\nITINERARIES
1815914	Sydney Wooderson, 92, Record-Setting Runner, Dies	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE4D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Sydney Charles Wooderson, a British lawyer who held the world record for the mile and whose athletic career was interrupted in its prime by World War II, died Dec. 21 in a nursing home in Wareham, in the south of England. He was 92.\nHis death was confirmed by Pat Calnan, an official for the Blackheath & Bromley Harriers Athletic Club.\nWooderson was one of the most versatile middle-distance runner of the 1930s and '40s, known for a finishing kick as bold as he was shy. His record in the mile, 4 minutes 6.4 seconds, set in 1937, stood for nearly five years. It was broken, then advanced several times by two runners from Sweden.\nWooderson also held world records for 800 meters and 880 yards.\nIn 1946, at the European Championships in Oslo, the first major postwar international track meet, Wooderson won the 5,000 meters in 14:08.6, what was then the second-fastest time ever. Three days later, with a troublesome Achilles' tendon, two years removed from rheumatic fever and hinting at the effects of wartime privation, Wooderson retired from international competition. He continued to race, however, and in 1948 won the national cross-country title for the Blackheath Harriers; he later served many years as an official for the club.\nWooderson was known as the Mighty Atom, but he resisted, in bearing and temperament, the extravagance of a nickname. He stood 5 feet 6 inches, weighed barely 125 pounds and wore thick glasses. His poor eyesight kept him out of the war, although he served as a fireman during the blitz of London. He eventually went blind.\nHarold Abrahams, the sprinter immortalized in the film ''Chariots of Fire,'' once said, ''If someone were to point out Sydney Wooderson to you on the running track and tell you he was the athlete who had run a mile more quickly than any other human being, you just wouldn't believe it.''\nHis career was also one of opportunities denied. He failed to advance past the first heat in the 1,500 meters at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, having injured his ankle stepping in a rabbit hole while taking a walk. In 1938, he skipped the Empire Games to take his law school exams. There were no Olympics in 1940 or 1944.\nWooderson remained an inspiration to generations of British runners. Sir Roger Bannister, who in 1954 became the first man to run a mile in under four minutes, remembered watching Wooderson race in 1945. ''He was always a gallant fighter, and I admired him as much for his attitude to running as for the feats he achieved,'' Bannister wrote in his autobiography. ''He was a methodical and unassuming athlete who gave up his time and energy to encourage youngsters even if they showed no promise.''\nLike all European athletes before commercial trans-Atlantic flight, Wooderson had limited exposure to his American counterparts. But in June 1939, he arrived at Princeton for what was billed as the Mile of the Century, a showdown against the great United States runners Glenn Cunningham, whose world record Wooderson had broken, and Archie San Romani. A year earlier, Cunningham ran 4:04.4 on a fast indoor track at Dartmouth. The International Amateur Athletics Federation would not recognize the time because Cunningham was paced for each quarter-mile by a different sprinter. But his feat was not lost on other milers.\nThe race on the Princeton cinders proved a disappointment from the start, with slow splits for the first two laps assuring that there would be no record. With a half-lap to go, Wooderson, who had led the entire way, collided with another runner and stumbled. He finished last in the five-man field, the victory going to Chuck Fenske. The British newspapers cried foul and clamored for a rematch. Wooderson said, characteristically, ''It's better forgotten.''\nWooderson ran his fastest mile, 4:04.2, in 1945, finishing second to Arne Andersson, one of the Swedes who had lowered his world record. But his last chance at Olympic glory ended in disappointment. Asked to carry the Olympic torch into Wembley Stadium to open the 1948 London Games, he was told upon arriving that the honor would go to someone else. According to the organizer of the torch relay, the organizing committee wanted ''a handsome final runner to light the Olympic flame'' and that ''even the then-Queen remarked to me, 'Of course we couldn't have had poor little Sydney.' ''\nWooderson was made a Member of the British Empire in 2000.\nHe is survived by his wife of 56 years, Pamela, a son and a daughter.\nCorrection: January 29, 2007, Monday An obituary on Jan. 2 about Sydney Wooderson, a British runner who once held the world record for the mile, misstated the name of the federation that did not recognize a 1938 record for the 4:04.4 mile set by Glenn Cunningham at Dartmouth. It was the International Amateur Athletic Federation, not Athletics.\nThe obituary also referred incompletely to the reasons given by the federation for rejecting the record. It did not recognize any indoor records until 1987, and it has never recognized indoor records set on tracks with laps longer than 220 yards; the Dartmouth track was 264 yards a lap. (As the obituary noted, the federation also rejected the record because Cunningham used four different quarter milers to pace him.)
1815915	Congressional Power Shift Revives Health Care Debate	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E3D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Within days of convening, the new Congress will return to some of the biggest battles of the last decade as House Democrats try to rush through legislation requiring the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries and overturning President Bush's restrictions on embryonic stem cell research.\nThe Medicare proposal highlights the profound differences between Democrats and Republicans over the future of the nation's health care system, the proper role of government and the role of private markets in securing the best value for the huge sums spent on health care.\nState officials say they wish Congress would focus on a more immediate problem: money for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for four million low-income children, is running out in more than a dozen states.\nDr. Rhonda M. Medows, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Community Health, said, ''Our program will run out of federal money in March, and all 260,000 children in the program will lose their health care coverage if Congress fails to act.''\nIn debating the future of the children's health program, which has broad bipartisan support, Congress will take up proposals to cover some of the 46 million people who have no health insurance.\nDr. Mark B. McClellan, former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said, ''Congress should consider expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program to low-income adults.'' Many Democrats agree. But even modest proposals may collide with Democratic efforts to restore fiscal discipline and to reduce the federal budget deficit.\nCongress convenes on Thursday. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who is in line to be speaker, has said the House will, in its first 100 hours, vote on bills to authorize drug price negotiations under Medicare and to expand federal financing of stem cell research.\nRepresentative Tom Allen, Democrat of Maine, said he was ''giddy'' at the prospect of being able to legislate on health care after toiling for 10 years in the minority. ''People in Maine find it incomprehensible that the Medicare law has a provision that forbids negotiation of lower prices,'' said Mr. Allen, who introduced a bill to give beneficiaries access to drug discounts negotiated by the government in 1998.\nBy adding a drug benefit to Medicare in 2003, Congress authorized the biggest expansion of the program since its creation in 1965. The drug benefit, unlike most Medicare benefits, is delivered entirely by private insurers subsidized by the government. The insurers negotiate with drug manufacturers to obtain discounts, often in return for promoting the use of particular drugs. The 2003 law prohibits the government from interfering in those negotiations and stipulates that Medicare cannot establish a list of preferred drugs.\nMost Democrats want to repeal the ban on price negotiations. Wendell E. Primus, an aide to Ms. Pelosi, said the Democratic proposal would require the secretary of health and human services to negotiate, but would not specify how.\n''It will be very simple language,'' Mr. Primus said. ''We do not think that Congress needs to hammer out all the details. There are a lot of smart people in the administration, including the secretary, who can look at how we're buying drugs -- the Medicaid program, the Department of Defense, vaccines, et cetera -- and figure out the best way of negotiating better prices with drug companies.''\nRepublicans said they welcomed the opportunity to debate the issue. The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, said the Democrats' proposal would ''take a wrecking ball to a popular program that has cut drug costs for consumers through competition.'' Such competition, he said, ''has kept prices lower than anyone expected.''\nAdministration officials suggested that Mr. Bush would veto a bill calling for price negotiations. Democrats could then exploit the issue in the 2008 campaign, as they did in the midterm elections.\nUnder a bill introduced in 2005 by several House Democrats, Medicare would offer a government-run drug plan, in addition to all the plans offered by private insurance companies, and federal officials would negotiate with drug manufacturers on the prices of drugs covered by the government plan.\nBut aides to Ms. Pelosi said House Democratic leaders now wanted to go further. Under their proposal, the government would negotiate on behalf of all people in Medicare drug plans, more than 22.5 million people.\nHouse Democrats assume that if the government negotiates lower drug prices, the savings will automatically be passed on to beneficiaries in the form of lower premiums. But they could not immediately say how they would guarantee that result. In the absence of detailed instructions from Congress, lower drug prices could mean lower costs and higher profits for the insurers that operate Medicare drug plans.\nMichael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said he did not want the power to negotiate. ''I don't believe I can do a better job than an efficient market,'' Mr. Leavitt said in an interview.\nLeslie V. Norwalk, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that under the Democrats' proposal her agency would have to ''hire hundreds of people to negotiate prices for 4,500 different drugs.'' And Ms. Norwalk said the agency would be besieged by lobbyists seeking higher Medicare payments for specific drugs. That, she said, is ''how Washington really works.''\nSenator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is in line to become chairman of the Finance Committee, helped shape the 2003 law. In March, he voted against a proposal to authorize drug price negotiations. But Mr. Baucus, who is up for re-election in 2008, said he had an open mind and would hold hearings on the idea.\nKate Leone, an aide to the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said Senate Democrats had the same legislative priorities as House Democrats, but were not committed to the 100-hour schedule.\nMr. Primus said the new Congress would also ''give the president another chance to veto a stem cell bill,'' like the one he vetoed in July.\nIn campaign commercials in 2006, Democrats and some Republicans boasted of their support for embryonic stem cell research as a way to find treatments for a wide range of diseases. Advocates of such research say that, despite gains in the elections, they still do not have the votes to override a veto. They are working with Senate allies on a plan to attach the stem cell bill to unrelated legislation that Mr. Bush would feel obliged to sign.\nLawmakers are also likely to wrestle with these issues:\nMany Democrats will try to reduce Medicare payments to managed care plans. They contend such plans are overpaid by about 10 percent. Insurers intend to fight back, with support from the Bush administration, Republican lawmakers and beneficiaries who see the plans as a way to obtain extra benefits at an affordable cost.\nCongress faces a huge challenge in devising a new formula to pay doctors for treating Medicare patients. Under the current formula, doctors' fees would be cut more than 4 percent a year for the next decade. Lawmakers are determined to avert such cuts, but see no easy way to pay the cost.\nDemocrats have drafted legislation to speed the approval of safe, low-cost versions of expensive biotechnology drugs, which account for a growing share of spending on pharmaceuticals.\nPeople who pay for health care, including state officials, employers and insurers, support such legislationas a way to slow spending on biotech drugs, which can cost more than $10,000 a year. Biotech companies argue that their products, made from living organisms, are so complex that they cannot be exactly duplicated by generic drug manufacturers. As a result, they say, a ''copy'' would rarely be interchangeable with the original.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved thousands of generic drugs deemed equivalent to traditional brand-name medicines. But the agency is unsure of its legal authority to approve such versions of biotech drugs.
1815916	Jeb Bush Ponders Future, Not Knowing What It Holds	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E3D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	When the same old irksome question popped up recently at one of his final public events here, Gov. Jeb Bush, addressing Spanish-speaking reporters, gave an atypically dramatic answer: ''Yo no tengo futuro,'' or ''I have no future.''\nHis words set off round-the-world buzz, with The Daily Telegraph of London going so far as to call them ''a recognition by the Bush family that their dynastic reign in American politics is drawing to a close.''\nBut in fact, the question lives on. Mr. Bush's spokeswoman said last week that he made the comment jokingly, and when asked about it later in an e-mail message, Mr. Bush himself replied, ''I was misunderstood by a reporter.''\nHe did not elaborate, leaving the world to know only this much: Half his life after he arrived in Miami as a 27-year-old real estate salesman, Governor Bush returns here this week without the title before his name and, he insists, without knowing what his future holds.\n''We're in the preface of the new book in my life and I just don't know yet,'' he told reporters last month in Tallahassee, a day after his official portrait, with a Bible and a BlackBerry in the background, was unveiled at the Governor's Mansion. ''I'm going to take some time off, hopefully do a little fishing, golfing, resting, reading, exercising. And I've got to make a living, so I'll figure it out probably in January.''\nFlorida, too, has some readjusting to do. After eight years in office, Mr. Bush, 53, is leaving as one of the most popular and prominent governors in state history, not least because of his relationship to President Bush (brother) and former President George Bush (son). Succeeding him is Attorney General Charlie Crist, who is Republican like Mr. Bush but otherwise starkly different.\nDespite the wishful prodding of admirers, Mr. Bush has adamantly ruled out a presidential campaign of his own next year, saying that he wants only to return to Miami with his wife, Columba, and their cat, Sugar. Yet rumors about his future have burst forth as regularly as exotic species in the Everglades -- among them that he would be the next commissioner of the National Football League, run for Senate or become Senator John McCain's running mate if Mr. McCain won the Republican nomination for president in 2008.\n''The presidency is out of the question at this point because of Bush fatigue,'' said Peter Schweizer, a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford who wrote ''The Bushes: A Dynasty'' with his wife, Rochelle. ''But the vice presidential slot is something that's very much in play. He's a successful governor of an important state, he helps shore up relations with the social conservatives and he has the Bush money machine.''\nOne of Mr. Bush's former chiefs of staff has gone to work for Mr. McCain's exploratory committee, but several other former aides have signed up with Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, another probable Republican contender.\n''Jeb is a policy-driven guy,'' Mr. Schweizer said. ''If he can be a vice president that plays some kind of a policy role as Cheney has, as Gore did in the Clinton administration, then Jeb Bush will be interested.''\nMany assume that for now -- at least partly at the urging of his wife, described as shy and eager to be out of the public eye -- Mr. Bush will return to the private sector. He reported a net worth of $1.4 million in 2005, down from $2.4 million in 1998.\nHe was a partner in a major real estate development firm here until his first, unsuccessful run for governor in 1994, but Mr. Schweizer predicted that Mr. Bush might now seek out work involving the bioscience industry or the Latin American economy, both of which ''he seems particularly animated by.''\nAll indications notwithstanding, ardent admirers like Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, are not giving up on the prospect of Mr. Bush jumping into the presidential race next year, especially if Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York becomes the Democratic candidate.\n''He could step in later than anybody else,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''You can run for president with the last name of Bush, even though there is and will be Bush fatigue, in a year that you're likely to be running against someone whose last name is Clinton.''\nFor the time being, Mr. Bush bought a car, a Chrysler 300C, and rented a $5,500-per-month, 3,949-square-foot condominium in Segovia Tower, a luxury building overlooking a golf course in lush Coral Gables.\n''I have no idea what I will be doing next,'' he wrote by e-mail from Boca Chica, Fla., where he was vacationing with his parents. ''My priorities are to hang out with my beloved wife (until she can't take it anymore! :)), work out every day and figure out what I will do next with my life.''\nAs for the continued speculation, he wrote: ''I am flattered that all sorts of people are interested in what I am going to do and many have offered advice as well. That will all subside soon.''\nSmall signs suggest, however, that he will have a hard time giving up executive powers. He told reporters that while buying furniture recently, he had to stifle the urge to tell the store owner a better way of doing business -- a trait his adversaries say they will not miss.\n''Bush was the type that if you did not agree with him, he really didn't have time for you,'' said State Senator Frederica Wilson, Democrat of Miami. ''He wanted you to rubber stamp every idea he had, and he wouldn't listen to reason.''\nWhile Mr. Bush is internationally famous, Mr. Crist, who will be sworn in as governor on Tuesday, is a stranger to all outside Florida and, but for his native Tampa Bay region, not particularly well known within the state either. While Mr. Bush was ideologically driven, often making enemies in pursuit of ''big, hairy, audacious goals'' and divisive social policies, Mr. Crist seems above all a pleaser, avoiding firm opinions and promising to be ''the people's governor.''\nYet despite Mr. Bush's abrasiveness and the plunging popularity of his brother the president, he has remained well liked -- or at least respected -- to the end, a feat in a state as ethnically and politically divided as Florida. A poll last month by Quinnipiac University found that 57 percent of Floridians feel he did a ''good'' or ''great'' job as governor, compared with only 10 percent who said he had done a ''bad'' job.\nHoward Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said the poll results reflected approval of Mr. Bush's persona more than of his policies. Mr. Simon pointed out that two major education initiatives during the governor's tenure -- a costly effort to lower class size and another to provide universal prekindergarten classes -- were passed by public referendum, over the governor's objections.\n''It needs to be said that the personal appeal and likeability of Jeb Bush has led the press and the public to overlook the extremism of many of his policies,'' he said.\nSeveral of Mr. Bush's pet initiatives in fact failed, including a school voucher program that the Florida Supreme Court found unconstitutional.\nBut Mr. Bush pushed through $19.3 billion in tax cuts, put an unprecedented emphasis on standardized testing in public schools, privatized thousands of government jobs and ended affirmative action in public university admissions. He also persuaded the Scripps Research Institute and other bioscience research groups to open laboratories in Florida, which he says will makethe state economy less dependent on tourism and create more high-paying jobs.\nAnd he has appointed more than a third of the state's judges, assuring that his socially and fiscally conservative beliefs will continue to hold some sway.\nWhile others have emoted about Mr. Bush's departure -- including his father, who wept as he described his second son's ''decency'' and ''honor'' in a speech in Tallahassee last month -- he has characteristically avoided introspection. Asked last month what he would miss most about the Governor's Mansion, he cited its beauty, its staff -- and its towels.\n''Fresh towels -- all you want,'' he said. ''Here, although I've been trained to do otherwise, it's just any time I want I can have many towels.''
1815917	A Party, With Pelosi Front and Center	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E3D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	During her first 100 hours as House speaker, Nancy Pelosi has vowed, she will sweep an aggressive legislative agenda through the newly Democratic-controlled House.\nBut first comes Pelosi-palooza.\nIn a three-day stretch of whirlwind events beginning on Wednesday, Mrs. Pelosi will celebrate her heritage (at the Italian Embassy), her faith (in a Roman Catholic Mass), her education (at Trinity College), her childhood (in Baltimore) and her current home (in a tribute by the singer Tony Bennett, of ''I Left My Heart in San Francisco'' fame).\nShe will embrace her status as the first female House speaker with a tea for women. She will highlight her pull among Democrats with a $1,000-per-person fund-raising concert. And she will welcome visitors to the halls of Congress in an open-house tour.\nIn the midst of it all, when the new Congress opens on Thursday, Mrs. Pelosi will be sworn in to her new post and plans to get to work on the House floor right away.\nThe extended, carefully staged festivities are expected to dominate the occasion of Mrs. Pelosi's ascendance as the Democrats take control of Congress. Although Senate Democrats are also ushering in a new majority this week, their leaders have arranged much more low-key events intended to celebrate their incoming freshmen rather than Harry Reid, the Nevada senator who will be the new majority leader.\nSupporters of Mrs. Pelosi said she had every right -- an obligation, even -- to underscore her new role, given the historic nature of her rise to power. Thus the week is planned to project much more than an ordinary handoff of power in Congress. It is intended to leave a firm imprint of the new House leader's style and substance on the national consciousness, reminding voters that Mrs. Pelosi is both the first woman to take the job as well as a Catholic mother of five with Italian, blue-collar roots.\n''It is an introduction of her to the country -- and certainly who she is, as an outgrowth of her family, her growing up in Baltimore, where she went to school, and the values and the roots she had in that community,'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and a close Pelosi ally.\nIn other words, she is not the liberal extremist her detractors have tried to depict (one Republican advertisement during the midterm election cycle warned that ''liberal Democrat Nancy Pelosi'' would embrace illegal immigrants and reward them with welfare, ominously asking, ''How do we stop her?'').\nYet a number of Mrs. Pelosi's supporters said the aim was not simply to define the new House speaker in mainstream political terms. They said she valued style and flourish -- previously embodied in her fashionable clothes and her habit of taking Ghirardelli chocolates to meetings -- and recognized that an inauguration with flair could help capture the national imagination.\nAt the same time, part of her power is derived from her vast network of wealthy donors, including California celebrities, who appreciate a lavish thank-you.\nRepresentative Anna G. Eshoo, a California Democrat who has been a friend of Mrs. Pelosi for decades, said, ''It will be done elegantly, because she's so tasteful.''\n''It will have some feminine touches to it, obviously,'' Ms. Eshoo said. ''But more than anything else, it is just highly celebratory, because there are so many firsts that are interwoven into her ascendancy.''\nSome Republicans have privately complained that Mrs. Pelosi is drawing too much attention to herself and failing to recognize that the week is not about her. Yet past House speakers have often been defined by their strong personalities and individual styles, and Democrats, by and large, said they were glad to see Mrs. Pelosi unabashedly seizing the spotlight.\n''I think what she's doing is perfectly appropriate, because she is making history,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who led the Democratic victory in the Senate.\nMany of the week's gatherings are ostensibly devoted to others, as well. The first event, a Mass at Trinity University, where Mrs. Pelosi graduated in 1962, is ''in remembrance of the children of Darfur and Katrina,'' according to a schedule released by her office. A tea that afternoon at the Mellon Auditorium will include a tribute to Ann W. Richards, the late governor of Texas (whose young granddaughter will speak, as will Mrs. Pelosi's). A prayer service at St. Peter's Catholic Church on Thursday is in ''honor of U.S. men and women in uniform.''\nOn Thursday, after her swearing in, Mrs. Pelosi will sponsor a concert at the National Building Museum (the performers Carole King and Wyclef Jean are expected to attend, along with Mr. Bennett). The next day, she plans to open up Congress for a ''people's House reception'' for the public. That afternoon, the departing mayor of Baltimore and governor-elect of Maryland, Martin O'Malley, will dedicate a city street to Mrs. Pelosi.\nThe Baltimore ceremony had been originally scheduled as the kickoff event on Tuesday, but it was moved in honor of the national day of mourning for former President Gerald R. Ford.\nWASHINGTON MEMO

Ford, which has been lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda, will be moved to the doors of the Senate today, where it will briefly lie in repose. After a short ceremony on the east steps of the Senate, the coffin will be transported to Washington National Cathedral for a funeral, which is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m.\nElizabeth Mullen, a spokeswoman for the cathedral, said tributes would be delivered by President Bush, former President George Bush, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and the news anchor Tom Brokaw.\nIn addition, Ms. Mullen said, the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves will sing the Lord's Prayer, accompanied by the United States Marine Orchestra.\nThe Rev. Dr. Robert G. Certain, rector of St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Palm Desert, Calif., will deliver a homily, and there will be readings by two of Mr. Ford's children, Susan Ford Bales and John G. Ford, known as Jack.\nThe Very Rev. Samuel T. Lloyd III, dean of Washington National Cathedral, and the Rev. John Bryson Chane, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, are scheduled to officiate.\nAfter the services, the body will be flown to the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., where it will lie in repose after a brief ceremony. On Wednesday, final services will be held at Grace Episcopal Church, and Mr. Ford will be interred on a hillside north of the museum.
1815919	Kissinger's Appearance Revives Memories of Vietnam Era	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E3D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Of all the aging Washington power brokers who have re-emerged in the shadow of the death of former President Gerald R. Ford, there is one, Henry A. Kissinger, for whom the return to the spotlight may be as much curse as blessing.\nAt 83, Mr. Kissinger, former secretary of state to Presidents Ford and Richard M. Nixon and sometime adviser to the current occupant of the White House, remains a towering figure in international relations. He is expected to be among a select few, including President Bush, to eulogize Mr. Ford on Tuesday at services at the Washington National Cathedral.\nBut at a time when the American public has soured on the war in Iraq -- indeed, at the precise moment the United States is recording the milestone of 3,000 American deaths there -- Mr. Kissinger's reappearance is stirring memories and rekindling debates about his role in managing another unpopular conflict, the Vietnam War.\n''Henry is certainly one of the most complex characters in recent American history, and he is someone who has, I think, justifiably been in the spotlight both for extraordinary brilliance and competence and at the same time clear defects,'' said David Rothkopf, a former managing director of Mr. Kissinger's consulting firm and the author of ''Running the World,'' about the National Security Council. ''One of the interesting dimensions of Gerald Ford's demise is the pictures it has brought back into the paper of Ford with Rumsfeld, Ford with Cheney, Ford with Henry.\n''It's forgotten that all of these people came together first 30 years ago dealing with Vietnam, dealing with a divided nation.''\nYet of all those former Ford advisers, only Mr. Kissinger continues to evoke the passions about Vietnam that Donald H. Rumsfeld, the former defense secretary, evokes today about Iraq. This year, the White House press secretary, Tony Snow, confirmed that Mr. Kissinger had been quietly advising President Bush about Iraq in private meetings in the Oval Office. Mr. Kissinger, Mr. Snow said, ''supports the overall thrust and direction of the administration policy'' in Iraq.\nGiven Mr. Kissinger's firsthand experience in the anguishing decisions about withdrawal from Vietnam, the disclosure sparked the inevitable Iraq-Vietnam comparisons that Mr. Bush has assiduously sought to avoid. Now, Mr. Ford's funeral is raising those comparisons anew.\nAaron David Miller, a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center who recently interviewed Mr. Kissinger for a book about American policy in the Middle East, describes Mr. Kissinger as ''the bête noire of the Vietnam antiwar crowd,'' an image that he says cannot be avoided as the Ford and Nixon presidencies are revisited this week.\n''Here's Kissinger back in the limelight,'' Mr. Miller said, ''with a lot of his luggage coming along with him.''\nSome of that luggage includes bags from Watergate. In 1969, as national security adviser to Mr. Nixon, Mr. Kissinger played a role in wiretapping the telephone of an aide, Morton H. Halperin, who was suspected of leaking classified information to reporters. Mr. Halperin sued. In 1992, Mr. Kissinger issued a formal apology.\n''That was the price for my ending the lawsuit,'' said Mr. Halperin, who became a civil liberties advocate and today is a leading opponent of the Bush administration's domestic wiretapping. ''Every time there was an event in the lawsuit, it would remind people of his role in wiretapping. He prefers to be remembered for other things.''\nMr. Kissinger is, of course, remembered not only for Vietnam, but also as being an architect of détente with the Soviet Union and the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. But slipped into the flattering tributes to Mr. Ford over the last week have been some unflattering depictions of Mr. Kissinger, including some from Mr. Ford himself.\nThere was some tension in the relationship. Mr. Kissinger was named secretary of state in 1973 by Mr. Nixon, all the while keeping his post as national security adviser. It was an unusual arrangement, one that allowed Mr. Kissinger to centralize his power over foreign policy while Mr. Nixon was preoccupied with Watergate. In 1975, Mr. Ford ended it, stripping Mr. Kissinger of the national security adviser title.\nMr. Kissinger balked. '' 'Mr. President, the press will misunderstand this,' '' Mr. Ford said, recounting Mr. Kissinger's reaction to Bob Woodward of The Washington Post in interviews published last week.\nThe interviews painted Mr. Kissinger as a bit of a management challenge for Mr. Ford, high impact, but high maintenance as well.\nMr. Ford called Mr. Kissinger a ''super secretary of state'' but cast him as overly confident -- ''Henry in his mind never made a mistake'' -- and overly sensitive to press criticism, so much that he routinely threatened to resign over it.\n''Henry publicly was a gruff, hard-nosed German-born diplomat,'' Mr. Ford was quoted as saying, ''but he had the thinnest skin of any public figure I ever knew.''\nIn a retrospective in Newsweek online, Mr. Kissinger had kind words for Mr. Ford, saying he ''moved with calm and sure-footedness'' to reassure the nation during what could have been a constitutional crisis.\nBut he also described how the former president relied on him, saying, ''After Nixon told Ford of the decision to resign, Ford's first call was to me.''\nMr. Rothkopf, who worked with Mr. Kissinger and interviewed Mr. Ford for his book, said Mr. Kissinger often said that ''Ford was underestimated, that he was much more intelligent and much more capable than people gave him credit for.'' Mr. Ford, he added, believed diminishing Mr. Kissinger's role was his ''most important contribution'' to the foreign policy bureaucracy.\n''What he was trying to do was restore Henry to the role of an adviser, not 'the' adviser,'' Mr. Rothkopf said. ''I think he had a sense that the national security system called for giving the president a range of views, and what had happened was that Nixon sank into the depths and Henry assumed greater power, that there was far too much judgment and power in the hands of one person who wasn't the president.''
1815920	At Funeral, a Gathering To Echo Reunions Past	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E3D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	On the morning of President Gerald R. Ford's funeral, his former cabinet secretaries and administration staff members will come together here once more, taking their seats in the black cars accompanying the funeral motorcade and in the pews of Washington National Cathedral.\nFor more than two decades, they had gathered at Mr. Ford's annual White House reunions, most of which were held in the nation's capital, where they chuckled over half-forgotten policy disputes and shook their heads sadly as their numbers dwindled and their host grew increasingly frail.\nEven as their career paths and personal lives diverged, they kept in touch with Mr. Ford and with one another, reminiscing at dinner parties and lunches, and in long-distance phone calls. In mourning their president on Tuesday, the alumni of his administration will also be celebrating his life and the intimate circle he created.\n''We've stayed together,'' said Brent Scowcroft, who served as national security adviser to Mr. Ford. ''There is a sense of community.''\nIn many ways, Tuesday's funeral will highlight those ties. Henry A. Kissinger, Mr. Ford's secretary of state, cut short his vacation to the Dominican Republic to attend the Washington solemnities, which began Saturday. Robert E. Barrett, Mr. Ford's military attaché, flew in from his home in Florida. Carla A. Hills, his housing secretary, and William T. Coleman Jr., his transportation secretary, who both still work in Washington, will join them as honorary pallbearers.\nThe funeral will also reunite several officials who gained prominence in Washington after Mr. Ford left office, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who served as Mr. Ford's chief of staff; Alan Greenspan, who was chairman of Mr. Ford's council of economic advisers years before he became chairman of the Federal Reserve; and Mr. Scowcroft, who also served as national security adviser to President George Bush. They, too, will be pallbearers.\nRon Nessen, who was Mr. Ford's press secretary and who will attend the ceremony at the cathedral, said Mr. Ford's White House team had bonded so deeply because members had served during ''an extraordinary time in American history.''\nIt was the mid-1970s, and Mr. Ford, unexpectedly thrust into the presidency, had scrambled to assemble a team that would guide a nation reeling from Watergate, from President Richard M. Nixon's resignation and pardon, from the winding down of the Vietnam War, and from gas lines and soaring inflation.\n''It was a shared experience, an amazing shared experience,'' Mr. Nessen said, ''and that's what keeps people in touch with each other.''\n''People are going to share a lot of their memories,'' Mr. Nessen said of the Tuesday reunion. ''And we'll be thinking of the more personal moments, the more personal conversations, the thoughtful things he did as a man, not just as president.''\nMr. Nessen and others said they particularly enjoyed swapping memories of how Mr. Ford had treated people, regardless of their station in life, with dignity and respect, and how he had never taken on airs.\nHe described the day when Mr. Ford's dog, Liberty, made a mess on the carpet in the Oval Office and a Navy steward had scrambled to clean it. The president stopped him.\n'' 'I'll do that,' '' Mr. Nessen recalled Mr. Ford saying. '' 'No man should have to clean up after another man's dog.' ''\nMr. Ford's energy secretary, Frank G. Zarb, remembered the time when Mr. Ford had been ready to make an announcement to the White House press corps but then realized he did not have any cufflinks handy.\n''He got two paperclips,'' Mr. Zarb recalled. ''And he said, 'Let's go. We have more important things to do.' ''\nMr. Coleman, the former transportation secretary, who said he had seen Mr. Ford four or five times a year, said he had relished the former president's warmth and humor, and his love of family and sports. The last time they spoke, about three months ago, they had talked football, he said.\n''Michigan had just defeated Michigan State,'' Mr. Coleman said. ''We had a good time.'' (As a young man, Mr. Ford played football for the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.)\nOf course, some of Mr. Ford's officials also clashed, and memories of those battles sometimes rankled. But for the most part, those rivalries faded over time, said Robert Orben, a speechwriter for Mr. Ford.\n''We're old now, and life has mellowed us,'' Mr. Orben said. ''Some old tensions get put away. There's a sense of camaraderie that continues.''\nMany officials held fast to that sense of closeness, particularly as Mr. Ford began to age and weaken.\nAt one recent reunion, Mr. Ford and his wife, Betty, sat on stools because they no longer had the energy to stand and shake hands with the scores of well-wishers. And at last year's gathering, Mr. Ford did not show up at all. Instead, he sent his regards via videotape. It was the first time he had missed a reunion.\nMr. Ford had been in and out of the hospital since January 2006, most recently in October for tests at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif. Mr. Scowcroft, who said he had spoken to Mr. Ford several times a year, said he could hear the difference in Mr. Ford's voice when they chatted last summer.\n''He sounded tired,'' Mr. Scowcroft said. ''There wasn't the same kind of vibrancy in his voice.''\nMr. Ford was 93 when he died last week. It is unclear whether the annual reunions will continue without him. But his administration officials said he would continue to inspire them.\n''There will be sadness, but there will also be gladness that will relate to his legacy, to his service to the country,'' said John O. Marsh Jr., an honorary pallbearer who served as a Virginia congressman before becoming a top aide to Mr. Ford.\n''Hopefully,'' Mr. Marsh said, ''it will renew our own spirit of commitment to public service.''\nTHE 38TH PRESIDENT
1815921	Mr. Wolfowitz and the Bank	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E3D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	When Paul Wolfowitz speaks publicly these days, he is usually making good sense. The head of the World Bank (formerly No. 2 at the Pentagon) has criticized Chinese banks for ignoring environmental and human rights standards when they lend to Africa, told the White House it needs to do more to alleviate African poverty, and has vowed that corrupt officials won't be allowed to siphon off money from projects that are supposed to benefit the poor.\nSo why do so many people at the bank mistrust him -- including many of the leading shareholders? At last fall's annual meeting, European ministers insisted that the bank's board would oversee Mr. Wolfowitz's anticorruption program, to ensure that no country was punished arbitrarily.\nThat is not a vote of confidence and not a healthy state of affairs. Mr. Wolfowitz needs to figure out how to earn more than just the Bush administration's trust.\nSome of his critics will never forgive him for championing the disastrous Iraq war. But he has compounded their suspicions, surrounding himself with a tight group of former Bush administration officials who -- true to their roots -- have little patience for explaining themselves and even less for criticism.\nMr. Wolfowitz and his aides did an especially poor job explaining their decisions to suspend or delay hundreds of millions of dollars in loans because of alleged corruption, feeding fears that they were settling scores. When Hilary Benn, Britain's top aid official, publicly questioned bank policies, an unidentified senior bank official dismissed Mr. Benn to The Financial Times as ''an ambitious political climber.'' That's no way to win friends or donors. Mr. Wolfowitz wrote to the paper to say that was not his view and has since visited London to patch things up, but relations remain cool.\nMr. Wolfowitz has yet to outline a broader vision for the bank, which might inspire his staff and rally international support. There are certainly a host of issues that need his leadership. The bank needs to give more of a voice to less wealthy and poor countries. It needs to find new ways to mobilize private sector financing. And it needs to get more deeply -- and more systematically -- involved in addressing global challenges like epidemics, sustainable energy and post-conflict reconstruction.\nMr. Wolfowitz deserves praise for championing debt relief for the world's poorest countries. And he is right that the bank needs to do a lot more to fight corruption, which can cripple any development effort. To be heard on these subjects, Mr. Wolfowitz will have to work harder to earn the trust of his staff, his shareholders and everyone who cares about development. He needs a more inclusive management style and a more diplomatic inner circle, and to articulate broader goals beyond stopping corruption. That way he would have the credibility to fight the good fight.\nEditorial
1815922	Holding the Line	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE3D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	The old year was certainly a boom one for American business, with record profits for companies and record bonuses on Wall Street. But in the background a major accounting scandal has quietly spread, now encompassing more than 120 companies. Fudging the grant date for stock options doesn't quite have the spotlight-grabbing immediacy of Enron's collapse, but it is still gaming the system at the expense of shareholders.\nA study sponsored by Harvard Law School suggests that a large number of board members, instead of watching out for self-enriching tricks, were sharing in the lucre. As Eric Dash reported in The Times recently, the study found that board members at roughly 460 companies, around 1,400 outside directors, likely received stock options that were manipulated, unnaturally boosting their value. In other words, many directors saw their stock holdings goosed along with executives'. So much for independent oversight.\nWhat is particularly disturbing is that the news of this malfeasance, far from leading to full-throated calls for investigation and punishment, has coincided with a broad-based effort from business advocates to roll back the stiffer regime of enforcement devised in the wake of Enron and WorldCom.\nThere is no legislative push to loosen laws and reverse rule changes precisely because there is little support for it among voters at a time when executive pay is skyrocketing and traders are bemoaning the fact that the Ferrari dealer is fresh out of quarter-million-dollar cars.\nSome logical tweaks were needed. The Justice Department's prosecution tactics in corporate cases had become a little too aggressive, and small companies deserved a break on requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley law -- a reform inspired by the malfeasance of large, complicated companies. But the relaxation of a few miscalibrated, onerous provisions is where this effort should end.\nEditorial

In 1999, she was granted refugee status and came to America to join her daughter. After the minimum five-year waiting period, Ms. Ovsyannikova applied to become a citizen. She passed her test and was told she would be mailed an invitation to take the oath of citizenship. Months passed, but no letter came.\nMs. Ovsyannikova wrote to several New York City and state representatives. ''I am such a small person,'' she said through a translator, pulling out a chubby stack of envelopes, ''but they wrote letters [back] to me!'' She also filed a lawsuit to speed up the process.\nMs. Ovsyannikova is an older woman with numerous health problems. She depends on Social Security to get by. While she waited for months, her benefits expired and she fell behind on her bills and rent. The UJA-Federation of New York, a beneficiary of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, worked with the Marks Jewish Community House of Bensonhurst to help Ms. Ovsyannikova with clothing and food.\nFinally, after a year of waiting, her invitation came.

1815924	100 Years Later, the Food Industry Is Still 'The Jungle'	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E2D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Nothing in ''The Jungle'' sticks with the reader quite like what went into the sausages. There was the rotting ham that could no longer be sold as ham. There were the rat droppings, rat poison and whole poisoned rats. Most chilling, there were the unnamed things ''in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.''\nUpton Sinclair wrote ''The Jungle'' as a labor exposé. He hoped that the book, which was billed as ''the 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' of wage slavery,'' would lead to improvements for the people to whom he dedicated it, ''the workingmen of America.'' But readers of ''The Jungle'' were less appalled by Sinclair's accounts of horrific working conditions than by what they learned about their food. ''I aimed at the public's heart,'' he famously declared, ''and by accident I hit it in the stomach.''\n''The Jungle,'' and the campaign that Sinclair waged after its publication, led directly to passage of a landmark federal food safety law, which took effect 100 years ago this week. Sinclair awakened a nation not just to the dangers in the food supply, but to the central role government has to play in keeping it safe. But as the poisonings of spinach eaters and Taco Bell customers recently made clear, the battle is far from over -- and in recent years, we have been moving in the wrong direction.\nWhen ''The Jungle'' was published, the public reaction was instantaneous. Outraged readers deluged President Theodore Roosevelt with letters. Roosevelt was ambivalent, but he invited Sinclair to the White House for lunch, and promised to send his labor commissioner and assistant Treasury secretary to Chicago to investigate.\nSinclair settled into a New York City hotel and started a publicity campaign. He wrote articles with titles like ''Campaign Against the Wholesale Poisoners of the Nation's Food,'' and released more stomach-churning details. Armour made its potted hams, he charged, by taking nubs of smoked beef, ''moldy and full of maggots,'' and grinding them with ham trimmings. In a newspaper letter to the editor, he dared J. Ogden Armour, the meatpacking magnate, to sue for libel.\nSinclair suspected Roosevelt's team would do a whitewash. But its report strongly reinforced the allegations of ''The Jungle.'' It included an array of Sinclarian images, like workers using privies without soap or toilet paper and returning ''directly from these places to plunge their unwashed hands into the meat.'' Popular outrage continued to grow, and the momentum for reform became unstoppable.\nAs a result of Sinclair's crusade, Congress passed the Food and Drug Act, which had been effectively blocked by industry. At the start of 1907, it became a federal crime to sell adulterated food or drugs, and the new law set up a system of federal inspections. Food had to be labeled, and it was illegal to misstate the contents. Future laws would expand on this newly declared government responsibility to ensure the safety of the nation's food supply.\nIn recent years, the momentum has shifted. Since the Reagan era, conservatives have tried to turn ''government regulation'' into an epithet. Books like ''The Death of Common Sense,'' a 1990's best-seller, have twisted the facts to argue that laws like a New York ordinance requiring restaurants to clean dishes in a way that kills salmonella are somehow an infringement on liberty.\nFood safety has been particularly hard-hit by this anti-regulatory climate. Harmful bacteria are rampant in meatpacking plants and in produce fields, but government oversight is eroding. The Bush administration has slashed the number of Food and Drug Administration inspectors, and it has installed a former lobbyist for the cattle industry as the Agriculture Department's chief of staff.\nBut this is an unusually promising moment for food safety. Wide media attention was given to last fall's spinach contamination, which killed three and injured more than 200 in 26 states, and to the Taco Bell food poisonings, which made dozens of people ill. And Democrats have recaptured Congress, which should hold hearings to get to the bottom of those recent food disasters and to explore what the next ones are likely to be. It should push for larger budgets for food inspections and, as one Democratic-sponsored bill calls for, create a single federal agency with responsibility for food safety.\nThe powerful meat and produce industries can be counted on to call on their allies in Congress and the White House for help in resisting. That would come as no surprise to Sinclair, who was already complaining loudly in 1906 that Armour & Co. had contributed $50,000 to the Republican Party, and that the meatpackers had hired a prominent government official ''as confidential adviser as to federal inspection problems.''\nThe answer, Sinclair believed, was always the same: providing the American people with the gritty truth that they needed to protect themselves. ''The source and fountain-head of genuine reform in this matter,'' Sinclair insisted, ''is an enlightened public opinion.''\nEditorial Observer

It is good business for employers to shun diabetics and other patients with costly chronic diseases and keep their insurance costs lower. Until health care in America becomes a right and not a privilege, the chronically ill will find themselves increasingly marginalized in the workplace.\nRosemary Harris, M.D. Newtown, Pa., Dec. 27, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nThe diabetics in your article demonstrate that not every illness or physical condition should be automatically considered a disability. What the article clearly shows is the desperate need to rewrite the Americans With Disabilities Act to provide clarity, even if it means tediously listing what is considered a disability and what is not.\nGo back and review the original purpose for the A.D.A. The previous definition of disability was that it adversely affected at least one or more of the major life activities. The prevailing perception among people today, however, is that a disability is the absence of optimal health. You need only observe those who use disabled parking spaces. People in wheelchairs should not have to compete for parking spaces with people who need no devices whatsoever for their mobility.\nThe universal sign for disability has become obsolete.\nDeborah Meyers Columbia, Md., Dec. 26, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nIn complaining that too many people who are not disabled demand special favors, William J. Kilberg, a Washington employment lawyer, compares the fact that he wears eyeglasses to the crippling complications experienced by both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics. ''Why is everybody a victim?'' he muses.\nIndeed, if only organ death, blindness, painful nerve damage, the rigors of testing blood and injecting insulin, the threat of coma, dialysis, transplantation and death were as trivial as Mr. Kilberg perceives them. Perhaps new glasses might help.\nTina Trent Atlanta, Dec. 26, 2006\nThe writer is a volunteer board member of a dialysis patients' rights group.\nTo the Editor:\nYes, education is the key to better understanding about diabetics. But one aspect of the problem was not discussed. Diabetics need to manage the disease so that it does not affect job performance.\nHaving hired and fired a diabetic worker, I found that the diabetic did not manage the illness, and therefore was unable to focus, frequently made severe errors in judgment because of neglect of diet and medication, and had to leave work early and frequently. Thus, performance was often very poor.\nWhere, then, does the responsibility lie?\nReba Sullivan Dexter, Mich., Dec. 26, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nSome groups of people seem more prone to diabetes than the rest of us: the obese, Hispanics, blacks and American Indians. This makes me wonder if diabetes has become yet another way to discriminate against people some are determined not to like.\nCharles McEniry Stoughton, Wis., Dec. 26, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nThank you for your article. But you do a disservice to all those with diabetes by referring to them as ''diabetics.'' We are not our diseases; we are individuals with lives and families. Such a reference is demeaning and promotes just the discrimination you were reporting.\nSusan Lesburg Boston, Dec. 26, 2006

I wanted my efforts to be supported, but under the seniority-based system of placement, my desire to be part of positive change was irrelevant.\nWhy would a well-meaning principal try to be a reformer? He or she would have no hand in selecting the faculty.\nI now work with like-minded colleagues and administrators in a Philadelphia public school, but it was possible only when an alternative to the seniority-based placement system was created.\nMatthew C. Baird Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nFinding teachers for the neediest classrooms is a challenge for many school districts.\nRegrettably, and all too often, assignments to these positions are seen as the ''dues'' new teachers must pay before they can work their way through the system and transfer to schools considered to be more desirable.\nOne way to curb this trend would be to limit the percentage of novice teachers that can be assigned to high-needs schools and to provide a higher level of support for beginning teachers in these positions.\nIt would also help if schools serving the neediest children were directed by experienced and highly qualified administrators.\nHoward Miller Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Dec. 27, 2006\nThe writer is an associate professor of literacy education at Mercy College.\nTo the Editor:\nThe ''bumping'' process that you describe is bogus.\nThe seniority rule regarding assignment to a school is: if a vacancy occurs, it is filled by seniority. Even this procedure has been watered down by the site-selection process, in which teachers must interview for a vacant position and seniority plays no part.\nThe idea that teachers change schools willy-nilly at their own choice is a myth.\nJohn Jaros Philadelphia, Dec. 27, 2006\nThe writer is a teacher.
1815929	As New Congress Nears, House Democrats Could Be Headed for Own Divide	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E2D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who with more than 50 years' tenure is the senior member of the House, is not so sure about the idea of creating an independent group to enforce ethics rules.\nBut Gabrielle Giffords, a brand-new House Democrat from Arizona, considers it a no-brainer. Of the longstanding approach in which lawmakers are seated on the ethics committee to police their peers, Representative-elect Giffords said, ''It is like having the fox guard the henhouse.''\nThose divergent outlooks over how best to fulfill the Democratic promise to clean up the House are just one illustration of a friction that could develop in the new Congress as the party takes control after 12 years in exile. While most attention will be focused on the divide between Republicans and Democrats, members of the new majority have their own differing perspectives, corresponding largely to length of service, that could ultimately prove more crucial to their success or failure.\nOf 233 Democrats who will be sworn in on Thursday, 147 -- 63 percent -- have been elected since Republicans won control of the House in 1994, and have never served in the majority. Those whose service predates the 1994 revolution, on the other hand, number only 86, or 37 percent. But it is this core of senior Democrats, Mr. Dingell among them, who will lead 20 of the 21 major committees and so exercise concentrated legislative power.\nThe differences in tenure tend to manifest themselves geographically as well. The makeup of the senior membership has a more urban flavor, while those more recently elected tend to come from the suburbs and exurbs. These newer members have faced tougher electoral opposition than their older counterparts, who in many cases represent overwhelmingly safe Democratic districts; a majority of new chairmen have traditional liberal roots.\nLawmakers, senior aides and analysts say the institutional gulf is not necessarily problematic and could even prove beneficial if Democratic leaders are able to harness the experience and skill of the chairmen to the enthusiasm and drive for reform exhibited by the newcomers.\nBut they worry that it could become a distraction if the ''old bulls,'' as they are sometimes called, believe that less seasoned lawmakers are demanding too much too fast or if the newer members see the veterans as representative of Congressional inertia.\n''The guys who have been there for a while and built up seniority saw an abuse of the system, so they know firsthand why it has to change,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, who will be chairman of the Democratic caucus. ''The new members ran on an agenda of why it has to be changed.\n''If managed correctly, you have the experience and energy to make changes. If not managed correctly, it has the potential to be a fault line.''\nLeading House Democrats say the long-tenured members and those sent to Congress in recent elections broadly agree on a desire to move ahead on social programs, ethics, energy, national security and fiscal responsibility. The differences, they say, are subtler. Do issues studied in the previous Congress, for instance, need a full further examination in committee, in deference to the new chairmen? Is there need for a separate commission to scrutinize war contracting, or should this too be the province of the committees?\nIn any event, it is clear that the lower classmen, particularly the large and celebrated group of 30 freshmen, want to move quickly.\n''The new class coming in and some of the other newer members are absolutely committed to delivering on the agenda we talked about during the election,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who will lead the House Democratic campaign effort for 2008. ''Now that we are in power, we want to make sure that we are changing direction in Washington, and that means following through not just on the big print but the fine print, a break with business as usual.''\nRepresentative-elect Ed Perlmutter, Democrat of Colorado, agreed.\n''I don't think the chairs are not looking to be aggressive,'' Mr. Perlmutter said, ''but I do see in this freshman class a real desire to make changes and move things along quickly, because I think that was the direction we were given by our voters.''\nSenior Democrats say that as the lawmakers who endured minority status for so long, they are the ones most painfully aware of a need for new direction. Their stake in holding on to a majority, they say, means protecting and advancing the careers of new lawmakers, who in many cases were elected with fund-raising and other help from senior Democrats.\n''It is not like we are just now meeting for the first time,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who will be chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and can tick off the names of junior committee members he has worked with, as well as several freshmen he personally supported. ''We all campaigned for these guys.''\nMr. Dingell said an urge to remake the House was hardly anything new.\n''This is a normal phenomenon which occurs in this place every two years,'' he said, ''and I have seen no class come in that could be described as different. We all come here just dying to do something. But the smart ones of us know how to get it done by working within the system. I have no fears they are out to burn the place down.''\nBut Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congressional observer at the American Enterprise Institute, said he saw competing drives among members of the new majority.\n''You have a significant number of Democrats who think the major change is that the whip is now in their hands and it is the Republicans taking the lash,'' Mr. Ornstein said. ''A number of others want to keep the spigots running, but just into their own pockets. Those who genuinely want to change the House -- the way it operates, the culture of Washington -- have their work cut out for them.''\nThe Democrats' leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the incoming speaker, has been in the House since 1987 but has never been chairwoman of a committee, and so in some respects her role may be that of an outsider free to pursue transformation. In one of her first tests, however, some seven weeks ago, many of those headed for chairmanships opposed her push to install Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania as majority leader. Instead, they backed Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, at least partly because they saw him as a check on Mrs. Pelosi's power. Mr. Hoyer went on to win.\nMrs. Pelosi has told allies that while she respects the authority of the new chairmen, she will not allow them to dominate the party agenda or stall legislative initiatives that have broad support. And she has already indicated that she does not intend to send the party's early legislative initiatives back through the committee process, but will instead bring a minimum-wage increase and energy and health bills, among others, straight to the floor.\nDemocrats senior and junior say they are watching to see whether their ideals merge or collide. But they view party differences as just another factor they will have to take into account as they assume control.\n''I think people understand it is a little bit of a bump and we have to deal with it,'' Mr. Frank said.\nMichael Arcuri, a moderate Democrat from upstate New York who won a Republican-held seat in November, said the combination of exuberance and experience should prove an advantage for the party.\n''If we strike the balance between the two,'' Mr. Arcuri said, ''we are going to accomplish some pretty incredible things.''\nCorrection: January 9, 2007, Tuesday An article last Tuesday about possible divisions among Democrats in Congress misstated the number of Democratic freshmen in the House. It is 42, not 30. (Democrats took over 30 Republican-held seats and 12 seats that had been vacated by Democrats.)
1815930	A Past That Makes Us Squirm	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E2D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	A FEW years back, while traveling in the Sierra Madre Occidental of northern Mexico, I came upon a canyon packed with cliff dwellings no one had lived in since before the time of Christopher Columbus. On the ground were discarded artifacts, pieces of frayed baskets, broken pottery and hundreds of desiccated corn cobs -- the ruins of an ancient civilization.\nI reached down to pick up what I thought was a dry gourd, and instead found myself cradling the skull of a human child. As I turned it in my hands, I noticed a deliberate hole in the back of the skull, directly above the spine. The skull was not cracked around the hole, which means the child had most likely been alive when a spike or some other implement had been slammed into his or her head from behind.\nThis is not the only skull like this. Excavations from elsewhere in northern Mexico have turned up other children killed the same way, human sacrifices to an ancient water deity, their bodies buried under pre-Columbian ball courts or at the foot of pillars in important rooms.\nWith knowledge of such widespread ferocity, I recently saw Mel Gibson's movie ''Apocalypto,'' which deals with the gore of the Mayan civilization. I had heard that the movie's violence was wildly out of control. But even as I winced at many of the scenes, as a writer and researcher in ancient American archaeology, I found little technical fault with the film other than ridiculous Hollywood ploys and niggling archaeological details.\nIndeed, parts of the archaeological record of the Americas read like a war-crimes indictment, with charred skeletons stacked like cordwood and innumerable human remains missing heads, legs and arms. In the American Southwest, which is my area of research, human tissue has been found cooked to the insides of kitchen jars and stained into a ceramic serving ladle. A grinding stone was found full of crushed human finger bones. A sample of human feces came up containing the remains of a cannibal's meal.\nIt could be argued that ''Apocalypto'' dehumanizes Native Americans, turning their ancestors into savage monsters, but I think it does the opposite. Oppressed hunter-gatherers in the movie are presented as people with the same, universal emotions all humans share. And urban Mayans are portrayed as politically and religiously savvy, having made of themselves a monumental, Neolithic empire, something more akin to ancient Egypt than the trouble-free agrarians who come to most people's minds when they think of native America.\nTo further shatter that popular notion of Native Americans, there's the scene in which a turquoise-jeweled priest stands atop a staggering temple yanking out one beating human heart after the next. That's an image that nearly every archaeologist working in Central America has played in his or her head many times, only now it's on the big screen for everyone to see.\nBeing told by screenwriters and archaeologists that their ancestors engaged in death cults tends to make many Native Americans uneasy. In Arizona, Hopi elders turn their eyes to the ground when they hear about their own past stained with overt brutality. The name Hopi means people of peace, which is what they strive to be. Meanwhile, excavators keep digging up evidence of cannibalism and ritualized violence among their ancestors.\nHow do we rectify the age-old perception of noble and peaceful native America with the reality that at times violence was coordinated on a scale never before witnessed by humanity? The answer is simple. We don't.\nPrior to 1492 it was a complex cultural landscape with civilization ebbing and flowing, the spaces in between traversed by ancient lineages of hunters and gatherers. To the religious core of pre-Columbian Mayans, a beating heart ripped from someone's chest was a thing of supreme sacredness and not prosaic violence.\nIf ''Apocalypto'' has a fault, it is not with its brutality, but with us in the audience who cringe, thinking the Mayans little more than a barbaric people. The fault lies in our misunderstanding of a complicated history, thinking we can lump a whole civilization into a single response and walk out of the movie saying, ''That was disgusting.''\nOp-Ed Contributor Craig Childs is the author of the forthcoming ''House of Rain: Tracking a Vanished Civilization Across the American Southwest.''
1815931	Dollars In The Sand	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E2D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Tourism is a modern global marvel. Every year, according to the World Tourism Organization, some 700 million people leave for foreign lands. They spend more than $575 billion, making tourism the world's leading item of foreign trade.\nFifteen million of those travelers, mainly from North America, head for the Caribbean, which is by far the most tourist dependent region of the world. On smaller islands like St. Lucia, tourism's contribution to the economy exceeds 70 percent, and the annual number of visitors far exceeds the resident population: Antigua's 64,000 residents put out the welcome mat for 231,000 visitors one recent year.\nWhy do the tourists come? Most analysts cite the three S's: Sun, Sand and Sea. Others add a fourth: Sex. The sex part is gender neutral, as a stroll though Ocho Rios immediately confirms. Wickedly handsome young men with flowing dreadlocks, some dyed blond, provide rent-a-dread services for women of every nationality. For most, it is a four-day fling; for a few, there is the hope that life will imitate art and, like Stella, they'll get their groove back.\nWhat do the islands gain? Tourism generates desperately needed foreign revenue for the government, creates employment (as high as 60 percent of the jobs in the Bahamas), and makes possible a wide range of support services and industries. For many of the smaller islands, it is a godsend, especially in the face of the collapsing traditional banana and sugar industries.\nNonetheless, the literature on Caribbean tourism is surprisingly critical. Foreign anthropologists complain about the ''tourist gaze'' and the distortion of local cultures; local chauvinists declaim that ''tourism is whorism.'' These criticisms are largely puerile. In Jamaica, it's the locals who do the gazing while the tourists are busy baking themselves behind the high walls of all-inclusive hotels. If anything, tourism enhances residents' awareness of indigenous cultures, and it supports large numbers of entertainers. Reggae artists have no problem singing dated versions of Harry Belafonte's ''Day-oh! Day da light an' me wan' go 'ome'' if it allows them to get nasty and ragamuffin the next night in the thriving dance hall music culture.\nThe criticisms of economists seem more substantial. The two buzzwords are linkages and leakages. On most islands, most of the money spent by tourists leaks right back out of the country to pay for supplies for the tourists, or for the repatriation of profits and salaries. Thus there is little linkage, or integration, with the rest of the economy, leaving the islands solely dependent on a fickle industry. Leakage runs as high as 80 percent on the smaller islands.\nHere is the critics' problem: The islands with the highest leakage and tourist dependence are all doing better, per capita, than the larger islands with more integrated economies. The Bahamas and Antigua have almost no unemployment and per-capita incomes three times that of Jamaica. And these islands have substantially higher human development indexes, the gold standard of how well a country is meeting a broad range of basic needs. Barbados's index of .864 approaches European levels.\nThe main cost of tourism is its effects on the environment. The disposal of solid waste from cruise ships and the poor treatment of hotel sewage threaten marine fauna, and degrade coral reefs and fishing grounds. Water sports are a menace. Beaches are eroded and landscape violated by bad architectural planning. Noise pollution is often unbearable. Corrective efforts have had limited success.\nHowever, the industry is too often criticized for the wrong reasons. In Jamaica, tourism is booming, and 2007 promises to be the industry's best year. Most American tourists go to the all-inclusives, which are criticized for greedily gating them off from the rest of the local economy. The real situation is more complex, as explained by Dr. Noel Lyon, a Harvard-trained economist and entrepreneur experienced in both farming and tourism.\nJamaica has terrible crime rates, but that has little effect on tourism because travelers know they are safe inside the all-inclusives. Furthermore, the all-inclusives draw substantially on local suppliers. Over all, Jamaica, with a high ratio of local ownership and management, has relatively lower leakage. All-inclusives are actually a nimble adaptation to a volatile social environment. Jamaica's socioeconomic failures cannot be linked to tourism, without which it would be in even more dire straits.\nGuest Columnist Orlando Patterson, a professor of sociology at Harvard, is a guest columnist.
1815932	The Deep Blue Highway	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE2D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	IN October President Bush signed the Safe Port Act, authorizing an investment of $6.7 billion to tighten security at American ports. This is a vitally important and overdue step. But it ignores another major problem in maritime commerce: the phenomenal decline of American shipping.\nWhile it's true that the United States Navy still dominates the world ocean -- its total tonnage equals the combined tonnage of the next 17 smaller navies -- American commercial shipping is but a puny remnant of its former self.\nIn 1948, more than a third of the world's merchant fleet flew the stars and stripes; today that figure is down to 2 percent. Half a century ago, America built more ships than any other nation, and New York City could boast that it was the world's busiest seaport. Sliding from the top since the 1980s, New York now barely ranks among the top 20.\nThe only American port now on the top-10 list is Los Angeles-Long Beach, an indication of how much maritime trade has shifted from the North Atlantic to the North Pacific.\nA major factor in the decline of American shipping has been an antiquated law that prevents American coastal shippers from buying ships made in other countries. By amending this law and, at the same time, encouraging the development of domestic coastal shipping, Congress could help restore America's status as a great and proud maritime nation.\nThe slump in American shipping is especially surprising when you consider that it was American entrepreneurs who, in the mid-20th century, revolutionized oceanic transport by creating both the standard-size steel shipping container and the supership capable of transporting 50 times as much cargo as a World War II-era merchant ship could.\nShipping has always been the most economically efficient way to carry goods from place to place; it requires no investment in highways or rails, and thanks to the relatively frictionless ease with which ships move across water, fuel costs per ton are low. The arrival of containerized shipping pushed transport costs even lower, swelling world trade and expanding global wealth.\nThe export-driven economies of Pacific Asia built much of their enormous success upon the new maritime technologies. The United States did not. The Merchant Marine Acts of the 1920s and '30s are one reason why.\nIntended to protect the domestic shipbuilding industry, the acts decreed that the only ships allowed to call on two or more consecutive American ports would be those built in the United States, owned by American companies, flying the American flag and operated by American crews.\nAt the time, the United States still had a large merchant marine. But the acts' restrictions handicapped coastal shipping within American waters, opening the way for the growth of the trucking and freight-rail industries.\nTo revive the maritime trade, Congress should give shipping companies as much choice in buying ships as their land-based rivals have when buying trucks and train cars.\nFreed from the restraints of the Merchant Marine Acts, commercial shippers could not only begin to resume their position in global trade but also handle much more of the freight that moves within our borders. Before railroads and highways were developed, a network of water transportation routes connected America's port cities and towns. Today coastal shipping handles only 2 percent of domestic freight, even though coastal counties hold more than half of the nation's population.\nThe trucks that carry nearly a third of our cargo clog the highways. That is one reason why Americans now lose at least 3.7 billion hours and 2.3 billion gallons of fuel each year sitting in traffic. Ships could take on a larger share of this freight -- and even some of the passengers now traveling by highway and rail -- and carry it at lower cost.\nCongress could further encourage domestic shipping by improving port facilities, just as it maintains interstate highways. And it could invest in developing ship propulsion technologies -- to increase still further maritime savings in fuel costs and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nAmericans are rightfully concerned about security, but part of protecting the nation is generating a strong economy. Revitalized coastal shipping could shorten our morning commutes as it begins to rejuvenate America's wider maritime economy.\nOp-Ed Contributor John Curtis Perry is the director of the maritime studies program at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Scott Borgerson is a recent graduate and Rockford Weitz is a Ph.D. candidate there.\nCorrection: January 20, 2007, Saturday An Op-Ed article on Jan. 2, about coastal shipping, misstated a provision of the Merchant Marine Acts. The acts bar non-American ships from loading and unloading merchandise at consecutive American ports; they do not prevent such ships from calling on consecutive ports.

1815934	Second Thoughts on Gays in the Military	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E1D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	TWO weeks ago, President Bush called for a long-term plan to increase the size of the armed forces. As our leaders consider various options for carrying out Mr. Bush's vision, one issue likely to generate fierce debate is ''don't ask, don't tell,'' the policy that bars openly gay service members from the military. Indeed, leaders in the new Congress are planning to re-introduce a bill to repeal the policy next year.\nAs was the case in 1993 -- the last time the American people thoroughly debated the question of whether openly gay men and lesbians should serve in the military -- the issue will give rise to passionate feelings on both sides. The debate must be conducted with sensitivity, but it must also consider the evidence that has emerged over the last 14 years.\nWhen I was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I supported the current policy because I believed that implementing a change in the rules at that time would have been too burdensome for our troops and commanders. I still believe that to have been true. The concern among many in the military was that given the longstanding view that homosexuality was incompatible with service, letting people who were openly gay serve would lower morale, harm recruitment and undermine unit cohesion.\nIn the early 1990s, large numbers of military personnel were opposed to letting openly gay men and lesbians serve. President Bill Clinton, who promised to lift the ban during his campaign, was overwhelmed by the strength of the opposition, which threatened to overturn any executive action he might take. The compromise that came to be known as ''don't ask, don't tell'' was thus a useful speed bump that allowed temperatures to cool for a period of time while the culture continued to evolve.\nThe question before us now is whether enough time has gone by to give this policy serious reconsideration. Much evidence suggests that it has.\nLast year I held a number of meetings with gay soldiers and marines, including some with combat experience in Iraq, and an openly gay senior sailor who was serving effectively as a member of a nuclear submarine crew. These conversations showed me just how much the military has changed, and that gays and lesbians can be accepted by their peers.\nThis perception is supported by a new Zogby poll of more than 500 service members returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, three quarters of whom said they were comfortable interacting with gay people. And 24 foreign nations, including Israel, Britain and other allies in the fight against terrorism, let gays serve openly, with none reporting morale or recruitment problems.\nI now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military, they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces. Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East, and we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job.\nBut if America is ready for a military policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation, the timing of the change should be carefully considered. As the 110th Congress opens for business, some of its most urgent priorities, like developing a more effective strategy in Iraq, share widespread support that spans political affiliations. Addressing such issues could help heal the divisions that cleave our country. Fighting early in this Congress to lift the ban on openly gay service members is not likely to add to that healing, and it risks alienating people whose support is needed to get this country on the right track.\nBy taking a measured, prudent approach to change, political and military leaders can focus on solving the nation's most pressing problems while remaining genuinely open to the eventual and inevitable lifting of the ban. When that day comes, gay men and lesbians will no longer have to conceal who they are, and the military will no longer need to sacrifice those whose service it cannot afford to lose.\nOp-Ed Contributor John M. Shalikashvili, a retired army general, was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1993 to 1997.

1815936	Few Clues in Fatal Shooting Of Woman and Son on L.I.	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Police investigators sifted through what they said were few clues on Monday in the fatal shooting of a 52-year-old woman and her 30-year-old son, who were found on Saturday night in a basement apartment where they lived with the son's wife and two young children.\nThe mother, Amelia Garcia, is thought to have died at the scene, while her son, Ferneliz Cruz, died about 24 hours later, on Sunday night, at Stony Brook University Hospital, according to the police. Both were discovered by Mr. Cruz's wife, identified by investigators as Yesenia Hernandez, when she returned from a coin laundry with her two children, an 8-year-old boy, Yerneli, and a 2-month-old.\n''The 8-year-old came to our door jumping up and down screaming, 'My grandma and my daddy's dead,' '' said Darlene Kennedy, 32, who lives next door with her six children. ''I went with him to the bottom of the steps of their apartment. His mother was yelling in Spanish. I tried to pull her away from there.''\nDetective Sgt. Edward Fandry of the Suffolk County police homicide squad said that Mr. Cruz and his wife had spent the early evening at a local self-service laundry with their two children.\nMr. Cruz returned home with several loads of washed and folded clothing while his wife waited for a final load to dry. She and the children arrived at the basement apartment about 20 minutes after he did, at 8:20 p.m., to find Mr. Cruz and Ms. Garcia lying in pools of blood. Ms. Garcia's body was in the kitchen; Mr. Cruz was found in an adjoining room.\nBoth had been shot more than once, but the police would not say how many times, or what type of firearm was used. There was no sign of forced entry or robbery.\n''We still do not have a clear understanding of what happened,'' Sergeant Fandry said. ''There is no motive, nothing going on that gives us anything yet.''\nThe family came from the Dominican Republic about 12 years ago, according to neighbors and the police. Ms. Garcia helped raise her son's children. Mr. Cruz worked at a local bakery, and may have held a second job as a waiter.\nThe police said there was no record of domestic violence in the family, or any history of problems with anyone in the family's large circle of relatives and friends.\nCoram, about 50 miles east of Manhattan, is a community of working-class and poor people. Speculators are known to rent out many houses to parolees, including sex offenders, a practice that stirred bitter local protests here last year.\nOn Monday, some of the victims' relatives and friends helped Ms. Hernandez retrieve some of the family's belongings from the apartment. They carried away bags of shoes and clothing, cardboard boxes, and dozens of cleanly pressed white shirts on hangers.\nMrs. Kennedy, the next-door neighbor, watched from her door.\n''When the police came, I took Yerneli to my house,'' she said. ''He stayed with us until relatives came for him. My kids tried playing a board game with him to keep him occupied -- Monsters, Inc. But he kept wanting to go outside.''
1815937	In First '07 Killing, Man, 26, Is Shot to Death in Brooklyn	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	A 26-year-old man was fatally shot yesterday afternoon with a single bullet to the back as he walked on a Brooklyn street with his girlfriend, in the first homicide of the year in New York City, the police said.\nThe authorities said that three people -- all male -- approached the couple about 12:30 p.m. near Tapscott Street and Sutter Avenue in Brownsville, and that one of them fired at the victim, Jonathan Ridley, of Grafton Street. Mr. Ridley was pronounced dead at the scene, and the police said there might have been an angry exchange of words before the gunman pulled the trigger.\nThe gunman and the two people with him ran away before two 911 calls -- one from Mr. Ridley's companion -- were made as Mr. Ridley lay dying on a rain-soaked sidewalk in front of 49 Sutter Street. The authorities said it appeared that the victim knew his killer and that the shooting may have stemmed from a dispute over drugs.\nMr. Ridley would have been 27 on the 27th of this month.\nThe killing was a contrast to the last two New Year's Days in the city. According to police figures, there were six shootings and four homicides on Jan. 1 of last year, and nine shootings and four homicides on the same day in 2005.\nIn the Brownsville shooting, several area residents said they had known the victim over the years.\n''He didn't have a bad rep in the neighborhood at all,'' said Jonathan Samual, 17, noting that he had been a friend of Mr. Ridley's since childhood.\nThe police said last night that Mr. Ridley had a long record of arrests over the years on charges that included at least one felony. Information on the disposition of the cases was unavailable. They said that he might have been grazed by another bullet in the shooting. Some neighbors speculated that the slaying was related to a large brawl involving a few dozen people that broke out an hour or two after midnight yesterday near the crime scene.\nBut a man who would provide only his first name, Donny, for fear of retribution from the gunman, said that he was with Mr. Ridley at a New Year's Eve party on Sunday night in another part of Brooklyn.\nDonny, who recalled that his friend had some kind of ''off-the-books job,'' said that the victim had been living with his mother and that his father was dead.\nYesterday's homicide follows a year in which there were 579 killings citywide as of Dec. 24 -- an increase of 52 homicides over the same period in 2005.
1815938	After 15 Years, Someone's in Charge in Somalia, if Barely	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0D61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	After Somalia's Islamist forces abandoned their final outpost on Monday, the transitional government moved aggressively to assert control, setting a three-day deadline for all weapons to be turned in and calling for international peacekeeping troops to be sent immediately.\nSomalia was already a place where military-grade weaponry was casually flaunted on its streets, but the Islamists' swift collapse has created such a surplus of guns that the average price of a Kalashnikov assault rifle, one of the world's most popular killing machines, has dropped to $15.\nAli Mohammed Gedi, the former veterinarian who is the transitional prime minister, said at his daily news conference that he would not tolerate the situation and gave instructions for turning in the weapons.\n''Individuals or groups of people who have trucks mounted with antiaircraft guns, known as 'technicals,' should bring those battlewagons to Mogadishu's old port,'' he said.\nClan leaders were skeptical about whether he would succeed, and many Somalis seemed dead set against it. ''They're trying to neuter us,'' said Muhammad Duudo, an unemployed car mechanic. ''And it's not going to happen. Just wait until the full moon passes and the darkness comes.''\nWhatever lies ahead, encouraging or ominous, most Somalis seemed to agree that after a week of fast-moving events, the rough outlines of a new reality were emerging. For the first time since the former dictator, Mohamed Siad Barre, fled the country in 1991, casting Somalia into 15 years of anarchy, there is a credible government based in Mogadishu, the capital, with serious outside support and no organized military threat from within.\nTrue, countless gunmen still roam the streets, heavily armed warlords still command authority and the seeds of a possible guerrilla movement may be taking root.\nBut so far no major force has emerged to challenge the authority of the transitional government. The only rival, the Islamists, lost their last conventional military battle on Monday. The Islamists had steadily lost ground since Dec. 24, when Ethiopia unleashed a punishing series of airstrikes and pushed ground troops deep into Somali territory.\nEthiopian officials justified their intervention in Somalia's messy, violent internal politics by saying the Islamist movement was a regional threat with terrorist connections and ambitions to invade their country. Ethiopia commands one of the most powerful militaries in Africa, and within days of its entrance into the war, Burhakaba, a pivotal inland town, fell from Islamist control -- then Jowhar, another key town, and then Mogadishu, the Islamists' former stronghold.\nBy Sunday, the last remnants of the Islamist forces, which just a few weeks ago controlled a large swath of Somalia, were cornered in Kismayo, a port city on the south Somali coast. Thousands of Ethiopian and transitional government troops were closing in on them, and on Sunday night, the Ethiopians began pounding away with heavy artillery.\nAt the same time, Kismayo clan elders were pleading with the Islamists to leave. The elders said the Islamists did not stand a chance, and they were worried that their city was about to be flattened. Clan elders in Mogadishu similarly decided last week that the Islamists were a losing cause and pulled their troops and weapons out of the movement.\nAs in Mogadishu, the Islamists in Kismayo, after many fiery speeches about fighting to the death, simply fled. By Monday morning, many of the Islamists' fighters in Kismayo had shed their uniforms and melted back into the population while others headed south toward a thickly forested area along the Kenyan border.\n''I can't tell you how happy people were that they disappeared,'' said Adam Ragay, a businessman in Kismayo.\nAs soon as the Islamists left, looters rushed into the streets and smashed up stores and ran away with televisions and cellphones. But by midafternoon, the brief burst of anarchy was over and transitional government troops had arrived on the outskirts of town.\nResidents of Kismayo said the remaining Islamists were heading toward Ras Kamboni, a small town in an isolated area on the Kenyan border that the Islamists had used before as a hide-out. Ethiopian intelligence officials say operatives of Al Qaeda, invited by the Islamists, planned the 1998 attacks on American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania from Ras Kamboni.\nKenyan officials say they have increased border security to keep the Islamists from escaping. ''Anyone who ventures to enter Kenya will have to go through a very serious vetting process,'' Alfred N. Mutua, a Kenyan spokesman, said in a statement on Monday.\nMr. Gedi has acknowledged that he needs a lot of outside help. Security in Mogadishu is still uncertain, with just a light presence of soldiers.\nMogadishu's ports and airport remain closed, strangling the flow of goods and sending prices for rice, sugar, oil and gasoline through the roof. The schools remain closed.\nOne of the Islamists' first steps after beginning their ill-fated attack on the transitional government was to close all schools to funnel more teenagers to the front. Their move backfired both militarily and politically after countless teenage soldiers were summarily mowed down by better-trained Ethiopian troops.\nAbdi Sallah, a pharmacist in Mogadishu, said he thought that the new government was heading in the right direction but that it needed to step gingerly. ''So, we ask all the militia to turn in their weapons and then what happens?'' he said. ''Do they become part of a national army or do they become unemployed? Have these guys thought all this through?''
1815939	Investors Greet New Year With Ambivalance	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07EFD61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Having enjoyed a year that was better than average in the stock market and a much weaker one in housing, home owners and investors appear neither exuberant nor glum about 2007.\nIn fact, they are decidedly ambivalent, according to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll. They are split, for instance, almost evenly on whether it is a good time to buy a new home or better to wait, even though a sizable majority expects home prices to stay steady or rise, especially in their neighborhoods.\nThe poll also showed that Americans had regained some faith in stocks as a safe investment since the market's crash in 2000, but they were less confident that stocks would rise next year than they were during the depths of the last bear market, in 2002.\nThe telephone survey was conducted from Dec. 8 to 10 and included 922 adults nationwide and has a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.\nThe seeming confusion and anxiety is not entirely new or limited to average Americans. Similar worries abounded in late 2005, when some economists and market experts predicted the nation's long housing boom would come to a screeching halt and inflict damage on the economy and the stock market.\nWhile home sales did plummet from record levels, the stock market rebounded to new heights after a brief stumble last summer. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted a 14 percent gain last year, its best showing since 2003. The American economy also put up stronger-than-expected performance as job growth and business investment made up for the faltering real estate market.\nStill, in follow-up interviews, several of those polled last month said that while they were confident about their personal financial positions, they were preparing themselves for tougher times by either changing their spending and investment patterns or by not taking as many risks.\nChristopher J. Pujol, an account manager at a pharmacy benefits company in Texas, said he planned to shift some of the assets in his 401(k) account to cash from stock-based mutual funds because he did not think the market would match its 2006 performance. ''The good times can't go on forever,'' he said. ''I take a conservative approach and take money off the table.''\nMr. Pujol is not alone. Skeptical market experts have raised concerns about the durability of the recent rally. More broadly, economists are significantly divided about the outlook for the year, from the most pessimistic among them predicting a recession and the most optimistic saying economic growth could be so strong that it may force policy makers to resume raising interest rates to fight inflation.\n''People seem to have a fairly balanced view about things,'' said Robert T. McGee, chief economist at U.S. Trust, who reviewed results of the poll. ''We have had a relatively strong housing boom and people recognize that is over, but at the same time the disappointment in stocks that occurred after 2000 and 2001 is dissipating some.''\nThe poll is in line with other recent surveys that show Americans are slightly more cautious, even though most of them have stable employment and are seeing their paychecks increase, said Lynn Franco, director of the consumer research center at the Conference Board, which produces a widely followed consumer confidence index. ''Over all, it's this glass half-full/half-empty scenario,'' she said.\nMr. Pujol, who lives in Keller, Tex., near Fort Worth, with his wife and their two young sons, thinks that the economy will moderate in 2007. The family bought a new home four years ago and is not planning to move but Mr. Pujol and his wife have other real estate investments in Texas that he thinks will fare better than property on the coasts.\nMr. Pujol reflected the view of most Southerners, 57 percent of whom said local housing prices would increase in the coming year and the same number said it was a good time to buy a house. Only 47 percent of people surveyed nationally said it was a good time to buy a house and 45 percent said local prices would increase. The difference may reflect the relative strength of housing in Texas, on the Gulf Coast and in the Carolinas.\nNot surprisingly, home owners were also more upbeat on housing -- 52 percent said it was a good time to buy a home -- than renters, 60 percent of whom felt it would be better to wait. (Similarly, 65 percent of people who owned stocks or mutual funds said the stock market would go up next year compared with 39 percent of people who did not have investments.)\nLaura Koepnick, a lawyer for the state of Massachusetts, said she and her partner would like to move to a bigger home from their condo in Boston but think home prices may fall further still.\n''It's more of a buyers market, but it has been so up and down that I am not comfortable making a huge investment at this time,'' said Ms. Koepnick, 36, who is still paying off law school loans and owns a mutual fund in a retirement account.\nDarla K. Bundy, who works for the state of Pennsylvania, would also like to move but she faces an entirely different set of challenges. So many homes are on sale in Ridgway, the small industrial town two and a half hours northeast of Pittsburgh where she lives, that Ms. Bundy said she could not make as much as she and her husband, a welder, owe on the property.\nIn 2001, Ms. Bundy lost an $18-an-hour job making specialty light bulbs for Sylvania when the company moved some production to Mexico. After taking a two-year computer training course paid for by the government, she has a $12-an-hour clerical job at the state transportation department.\n''My husband and I would love to make financial investments to prepare for retirement,'' Ms. Bundy, 42, said. ''But to even take $20 out of our budget and put it somewhere else is unthinkable.''\nLike several other people, Ms. Bundy pointed to Sept. 11, 2001, as a critical turning point for her family -- she lost her job shortly before the attacks of that day and her husband has had a hard time finding work ever since.\nThe brief recession that followed the technology bust in 2000 ended before the attacks of 2001, but many Americans view the attacks as an important historical marker in the nation's and their personal economic lives. That may be a function of the weak employment and wage growth that characterized the economic recovery from 2002 to 2004.\nThe economy was ''pretty good until 9/11, and then it took a major dive,'' said Dawn E. Owsley, a 33-year-old who owns a spa business in Olympia, Wash. ''And then it picked up a little. But I feel that we have not yet caught up.''\nOver all, a majority, 52 percent, said they were making enough to pay bills and obligations and a sizable minority, 35 percent, said they earned enough to save and buy extras, while 12 percent said they did not make enough to meet their household expenses. By comparison, 17 percent of those who answered that question in early 2005 said they did not make enough, 48 percent said they did and 33 percent said they could save and buy extras.\nMost Americans, 71 percent, said if they had extra money to invest they would put it in real estate rather than stocks, which were favored by 22 percent of the respondents. By comparison, during the peak of the housing boom in the spring of 2005, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 80 percent preferred real estate and 13 percent stocks.\nOf those polled, 77 percent said they owned their own home and 21 percent said they rented. But only 44 percent said they owned stocks or mutual funds, down from 56 percent in the first half of 2000.\nThat shift away from stock ownership is not surprising given that many investors are still smarting from the technology-led crash of 2000 and the two-year bear market that followed. And in spite of the recent rally, mutual fund flows indicate that investors remain skeptical of American stocks. As of Dec. 27, investors poured $15 billion into domestic equity funds in 2006, compared with $134 billion in nondomestic funds and $305 billion in money market funds, according to AMG Data Services.\nEdward A. Kellerhals, a retired municipal electrical inspector who lives near Fresno, Calif., said his investments in stocks and real estate had provided a comfortable retirement for him and his wife. Though he has long thought that land is a better investment than stocks, he became convinced that real estate prices in California had become outlandish when he and his wife were looking to buy a home at the end of 2005.\n''This piece of junk we saw was selling for $300,000,'' Mr. Kellerhals, 76, said. ''The roof was leaking all over the place and there was a trailer with a caved-in roof in the back.''\nHe has become more bullish on stocks, but says that at their age he and his wife ''don't buy much stock anymore.''\n''We are just slowly going to sell it all,'' he said.\nHow the Poll Was Conducted\nThe latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 8 through Dec. 10 with 922 adults throughout the United States.\nThe sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.\nWithin each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.\nThe results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, marital status, age and education.\nIn theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. Shifts in results between polls also have a larger sampling error.\nIn addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.\nVariation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.\nComplete questions and results are available at nytimes.com/polls.\nTHE YEAR AHEAD IN MARKETS
1815940	Using Web Cams but Few Inhibitions, the Young Turn to Risky Social Sites	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EFD61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Popular Web sites like YouTube and MySpace have hired the equivalent of school hallway monitors to police what visitors to their sites can see and do by cracking down on piracy and depictions of nudity and violence.\nSo where do the young thrill-seekers go?\nIncreasingly, to new Web sites like Stickam.com, which is building a business by going where others fear to tread: into the realm of unfiltered live broadcasts from Web cameras.\nThe site combines elements of more popular sites, but with a twist. In addition to designing their own pages and uploading video clips, its users broadcast live video of themselves and conduct face-to-face video chats with other users, often from their bedrooms and all without monitoring by any of Stickam's 35 employees.\nOther social networks have decided against allowing conversations over live video because of the potential for abuse and opposition from child-safety advocates. ''The only thing you get from the combination of Web cams and young people are problems,'' said Parry Aftab, executive director of the child protection organization WiredSafety.org. ''Web cams are a magnet for sexual predators.''\nThe larger Internet companies have come under increasing pressure to make their sites safer for children and friendlier to copyright holders, so start-ups like Stickam are pursuing their own slices of the market, often at the price of taste, ethics and perhaps even child safety.\n''Letting people do whatever they want is one way for these sites to differentiate themselves,'' said Josh Bernoff, a Forrester Research analyst. ''It is the race to the bottom.''\nVideo-sharing sites in particular are filling niches abandoned by YouTube, which is now owned by Google and had more than 25 million visitors last month. Since its inception in 2005, YouTube has banned nudity and taken down copyrighted material when rights holders file specific complaints.\nLast March, under additional pressure from copyright holders, YouTube placed a 10-minute limit on clips.\nSmaller start-ups who are not able, or willing, to be as diligent are seeing their audiences explode as users seek the more freewheeling environment that typified YouTube's early days. Users post 9,000 new videos a day to Dailymotion, which had more than 1.3 million visitors in November, up more than 100 percent since May, according to the tracking firm ComScore Media Metrix.\nA recent search on Dailymotion, which is based in Paris, found hours of copyrighted material: entire episodes of NBC's ''Heroes'' and CBS's ''Without a Trace,'' recordings of Beatles concerts and plenty of nudity. The firm places no length restrictions on uploaded video.\nBenjamin Bejbaum, the chief executive of Dailymotion, said the firm's 30 employees move quickly to take down video when users or rights-holders flag it as inappropriate or illegal. Mr. Bejbaum's company is seeking the kinds of revenue-sharing deals with copyright holders that Google has struck, he said.\nDailymotion currently shows ads to its users in France, which make up 40 percent of visitors to the service, and is studying an entry into the United States.\nAnother new video-sharing site, LiveLeak, based in London, has positioned itself as a source for reality-based fare like footage of Iraq battle scenes and grisly accidents. Last week, popular clips on the site included one of an agitated man in Muslim dress on a fast-moving treadmill and video of an American A-20 aircraft bombing Taliban forces in Afghanistan.\nHayden Hewitt, a co-owner of LiveLeak, said that people who have been barred from YouTube for uploading explicit footage of the Iraq war have migrated to his site. LiveLeak ''won't ban anyone for showing the truth,'' Mr. Hewitt said. The site also features ample sexual content that would never make it onto YouTube or MySpace.\nTo support itself, LiveLeak runs ads from the syndicated ad network Adbrite. Mr. Hewitt said the company was not trying to get rich or dethrone YouTube, but to create a place on the Web for unvarnished reality.\nFew of these new video sites, though, worry child-safety advocates as much as Stickam, which mostly attracts young people comfortable with the idea of a continuous self-produced reality TV show starring themselves. Stickam, based in Los Angeles, says it has 260,000 registered users -- 50,000 of them say their age is 14 to 17 -- and is adding 2,000 to 3,000 each day.\nAdvanced Video Communications, a Los Angeles company that builds video conferencing systems for companies, founded Stickam (pronounced stick-cam) late last year to demonstrate its technology. Its first product was a program that let users bring a live Web cam feed directly onto their MySpace pages and other social networks and bulletin boards.\nIn October, MySpace blocked the Stickam service. MySpace's chief security officer, Hemanshu Nigam, said the firm ''has not implemented video chat features, given the safety implications for our users.''\nBy then, Stickam was testing its own social networking service to compete directly with MySpace. The new site prohibits anyone under 14 from joining, and its terms of service forbid ''obscene, profane and indecent'' behavior. But since the company does not verify a user's age, and because users' broadcasts are live, even the firm's chief executive, Hideki Kishioka, concedes those rules are unenforceable. The company is ''relying on users to monitor each other,'' he said.\nEven enthusiastic Stickam users say the site often feels lawless. ''People are very vulgar and like to 'get their jollies' from harassing people, mainly girls, to take off their clothes,'' said Chelsey, a 17-year-old user from Saskatchewan in Canada, who signed up after her 13-year-old sister violated the site's age rules and joined the service.\n''I'm pretty sure none of their parents know or even think about the things that they are doing on this site,'' said Chelsey, who said in an e-mail message that she did not feel comfortable using her last name in an interview.\nOther companies that offer Web cam chats say that the technology seems to attract abuse. ''There are just some people who, if you give them a Web cam, are going to take off their clothes,'' said Jason Katz, founder of PalTalk, an eight-year-old service that lets users converse over Web cams on various topics. Unlike Stickam, PalTalk asks for a credit card and charges a monthly fee, which it says prevents minors from signing up.\nAt least one major media company has embraced Stickam. Last month, Warner Brothers Records opened a page on the service for two of its artists, Jamie Kennedy and Stu Stone, and trained a Web cam on them as they recorded a music video. More than 9,500 users watched the event and chatted with the performers during breaks in filming.\nRobin Bechtel, Warner's vice president for new media, said she thinks Stickam ''could be the next MySpace'' and that people would migrate to even controversial video sites if they have features that MySpace and YouTube did not. ''People are going to go where the content is,'' Ms. Bechtel said. ''If Stickam has celebrities and is entertaining, they will go there.''\nMr. Kihioka of Stickam said that in some respects, his site was actually safer than other social networks. Live video feeds let users ''know who they are talking to,'' he said. ''Unlike MySpace, it is hard to disguise yourself.'' But he added that his company had the same concerns about child safety as MySpace and was working on an automated system that would monitor live video feeds for indecency.\nChild-safety experts are not convinced. They say that sites like Stickam are the motivation for them to work closely with sites like MySpace and YouTube to create safeguards.\n''If we discourage the use of the more corporately responsible social networking sites, kids will go underground to more edgier ones,'' said Donna Rice Hughes, president of the Internet safety organization Enough Is Enough in Virginia. ''Then we'll have more of a problem.''\nCorrection: January 4, 2007, Thursday An article in Business Day on Tuesday about Web sites that offer unfiltered video clips misstated the type of aircraft shown attacking Taliban forces in Afghanistan in one such video. It was an A-10 Thunderbolt, not an A-20 Havoc.
1815941	Weathering a Storm in Shelter	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802EFD61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Five years ago, the United States economy went through a recession that did virtually no damage to the housing market. In 2007, the question is whether the economy can emerge unscathed from a housing recession.\nAs 2006 ended, the opinion of stock market investors could not have been clearer: there are blue skies ahead. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was up 16.3 percent for 2006, was setting new highs in the final week of the year, and even the shares of home builders had rallied sharply from their midyear lows.\nIn the bond market, however, the outlook was cloudy at best. Prices in the futures market showed that investors expected that the next move by the Federal Reserve would be to reduce the interest rate it has raised 17 times since mid-2004.\nThat indicates worry about a slowing economy. And another traditional indicator -- the yield curve -- says the same thing. When short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates, as they do now, a recession often follows.\nNonetheless, there are other indicators in the bond market to show a complete lack of worry. In a recession, less creditworthy borrowers are more likely to default as business turns bad, so investors who fear a downturn are expected to demand higher interest rates from them.\nBut investors are not doing that. The spread between Treasury bonds and BB-rated bonds -- the best level of junk -- has shrunk to historic lows of less than two percentage points. And while very bad junk bonds -- those rated CCC or lower -- pay much more, spreads there fell to their lowest ever in 2006, although they drifted up a bit late in the year.\nSo the stock market says a boom is here and is going to stay, housing notwithstanding. And the bond market expects a recession -- but one that does not damage those who are financially stretched before it begins. ''We think of markets as forecasters,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. ''But it is very hard to come up with a model'' that makes sense of the current forecasts.\nThe answer to that conundrum is probably to look at markets from a different perspective. They move because money comes in or goes out, and money now is easier and more plentiful than ever. So most asset prices have risen, whether stocks or long-term bonds or commodities. An exception is short-term debt. There is no upside to a Treasury bill that matures in a few months, and thus little attraction to it.\nThere is a perception that central banks tightened in 2006, and that was true of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. But it is anything but accurate about the central banks that matter the most now.\n''We are in a global market, with the central banks of Japan and China very, very easy,'' Mr. Barbera said. ''Two central banks are pumping it out hand over fist.''\nWhere is the money going? Into consumption in many countries, and into a bidding war for assets as well. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which generally contains the largest public companies in the United States, now has eight companies in it that have announced plans to go private, often with a lot of borrowed money involved.\nAnd companies that are awash with cash are putting a lot of that money into dividends and even more into stock buybacks, at least among S.& P. 500 companies, reports Howard Silverblatt, an analyst with Standard & Poor's. He estimates that those 500 companies spent $425 billion on capital in 2006, up 3 percent from the prior year, and spent $437 billion on stock buybacks, up 25 percent. It was the first year ever that more money was spent on buybacks than capital spending. Dividends climbed 11 percent, to $224 billion.\nStock of Exxon Mobil, the largest company in the country by market value, rose 36 percent, but because of share buybacks the company's market value climbed only 28 percent, leaving it at $447 billion. That is still well below the record year-end value for an American company, the $603 billion valuation for Microsoft at the end of 1999. Microsoft, its stock up 14 percent in 2006, ended the year as the fourth-largest company, with a market value of $258 billion, trailing General Electric and Citigroup.\nAmong all companies, not just those in the index, S.& P. counted 221 special dividends in December, the most for a single month since 1978.\nSome stocks went down, of course, but not that many. All of the 10 sectors in the S.& P. 500 showed gains, with the best performance coming from telecommunications services, which rose 32 percent, and the worst from health care, which managed a gain of 6 percent.\nThe overall index managed a gain in 11 of the 12 months, the exception being May. The last time the index managed that was in 1958. For what it's worth, the year that followed, 1959, was a respectable year with a rise of more than 8 percent.\nBut as good as the market was in the United States, it was better almost everywhere else. The S.& P. 500 rose 13.6 percent. But in dollar terms, virtually every major market in Europe was up at least 20 percent, and some grew much more. The Asian performance was more mixed, with Japan's leading index rising just 5.7 percent, but many of those markets did much better than the United States did.\nThe vast majority of American stocks have surpassed the highs they set in the great bull market that ended in 2000, but that is not true of many of the most prominent stocks. That bull market was kindest to technology stocks; many of them have not come close to recovering to their old peaks, and may never do so. It was also kind to large stocks in general, as a lot of money poured into index funds that tracked the S.& P. 500 index, and some of the largest, such as General Electric and Merck, are well below where they were.\nThat index, calculated the traditional way that gives the highest weight to the largest companies, ended the year at 1,418.30, still 7.1 percent below its 2000 high of 1,527.48. But the index is also calculated on an equal-weighted basis, in which each of the 500 stocks counts as much as any other. For the year, that index did only a little better than the regular S.& P., but it ended the year 52 percent above its 2000 high.\nThe Dow, of course, set records in the year. But just 8 of the 30 Dow stocks -- Boeing, Exxon Mobil, Altria, American Express, Procter & Gamble, United Technologies, Caterpillar and Citigroup -- set new highs in 2006. Two of them, Eastman Kodak and International Paper, have never risen above the highs they set in 1997.\nThe dollar, widely forecast to weaken, did so against the euro, and the Chinese yuan was allowed to float upward against the dollar, gaining 3.4 percent during the year. But the dollar actually showed a small gain against the Japanese yen.\nThat the dollar held up as well as it did in the face of growing trade deficits reflects that people around the world continue to be happy to hold dollar-denominated assets, including Treasury securities. That willingness has also helped to hold down interest rates in this country.\nThose low interest rates helped support home prices. As home prices rose, lenders became more willing to lend on homes with little equity, or to people whose ability to repay seemed suspect, and that lending also provided money to keep consumption strong. Mortgage defaults were few and far between, which was hardly a surprise given that virtually any home could be sold for more than had been borrowed against it.\nBut that started to change in 2006. Some subprime loans -- a polite way of saying loans to people with poor credit -- defaulted soon after they were issued. The banking regulators, who had watched without action as the mortgage market heated up, finally put out guidelines aimed at restricting risky borrowing just as the market was turning lower. That could make it hard for homeowners under financial stress to refinance their existing home loans.\nWith prices falling in some regions, home builders reported a surge of cancellations of purchase contracts. Housing starts plunged, and although starts showed a reassuring increase in November, newly issued permits to build new homes continued to decline.\nOddly enough, rising home sales could be a bad sign in 2007, particularly if prices continue to sag. A surge in sales of existing homes could be an indication that people were being forced to sell, and that could have a depressing effect on purchases of other things.\nIn the past, when home prices fell, the number of homes sold also fell, as homeowners hung on to wait for good times to return. That could be harder this time, at least for those with mortgages that allow large increases in monthly payments.\nBut even with housing in many areas of the United States on the ropes, much of the rest of the world seems to be humming along. There is strong economic growth in most of the developing world, and many commodities prices continue to be strong.\nStill, it was in commodities that the perils of a liquidity-driven market were exposed. Crude oil ended the year at virtually the same level as a year earlier, but spot natural gas was down 44 percent. It is no coincidence that a bet on natural gas led to the most notable hedge fund blowup of the year. Reality, in the form of warmer weather and higher inventories than expected, sent prices plunging.\nNo such disasters have befallen most other markets, and with earnings strong, perhaps they will be averted. Easy money is driving up asset prices, and that could continue in 2007.\nTHE YEAR AHEAD IN MARKETS
1815943	West Tries a New Tack to Block Iran's Nuclear Agenda	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04EED61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	The United States and its allies in Europe, in a tacit acknowledgment that sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council in late December are too weak to force Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, have embarked on a new strategy to increase the financial and psychological pressure.\nThe plan is to use the language of the resolution to help persuade foreign governments and financial institutions to cut ties with Iranian businesses, individuals in its nuclear and missile programs and, by extension, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, said Stuart Levey, under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence.\nThe Guard and its military wing are identified as a power base for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nUnder his administration, American officials said, the Guard has moved increasingly into commercial operations, earning profits and extending its influence in Iran in areas involving big government contracts -- including building airports and other infrastructure, oil production and the providing of cellphones.\nBush administration officials, who asked not to be identified because they were discussing diplomatic plans, said envoys would soon head abroad to press officials of foreign governments and banks to interpret the Security Council resolution equally aggressively.\nThe new strategy builds on the Treasury Department's efforts over the past few months to get Western banks to scale back business with Iran or risk running afoul of American laws. In 2006, the European banks Credit Suisse First Boston and UBS said they would not do any new business with Iran.\nIt is hard to assess how deeply the financial actions may cut, since the most willing parties to the effort -- the United States and Europe -- have few business dealings with Iran. The United States does have laws that give it considerable leeway to impose financial restrictions on banks and companies doing business in Iran, while European law does not.\nThat said, Britain is also backing the new push, as is France, although to a lesser extent. Germany, with far more business interests in Iran, is not quite as eager. Japan is not a member of the Security Council, and the country is heavily dependent on the Persian Gulf for oil. But Japanese government officials have recently indicated their willingness to limit some of their business dealings with Iran.\nLast month, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation announced that it would not issue any new loans for Iranian projects until Iran resolved the nuclear impasse with the West. In addition, Japan has reduced its stake in an initial $2 billion deal to develop Iran's largest onshore oil field at Azadegan to 10 percent from the originally agreed 75 percent, citing concern about Iran's nuclear program.\nWhile United States officials have discussed what they are trying to do with their Russian and Chinese counterparts, the belief is that they have gone about as far as they are willing to go with the Security Council resolution that passed Dec. 23. Russia fought to keep certain entities off the list and to keep the list as narrow as possible.\nMr. Levey noted that the resolution cited three people as off limits to outside commercial transactions, and, in another section, prohibited transactions with agencies ''owned or controlled'' by them. The three, he said, are Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps; Gen. Hosein Salimi, who is in charge of the air force branch of the corps; and Ahmad Vahid Dastjerdi, who runs the Aerospace Industries Organization.\nThus, an effort to bar future foreign commercial or government involvement, including bank transactions, affecting missile programs and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is authorized by the resolution, Mr. Levey said.\n''This resolution will be a big step forward in getting governments and financial institutions to pay more attention to Iran's use of deceptive financial practices to facilitate its dangerous conduct and to stop doing business with the I.R.G.C.,'' Mr. Levey said, referring to the Revolutionary Guard.\nThe resolution says that ''all states'' will ''take the necessary measures'' to bar ''financial assistance'' and ''financial resources or services'' related to nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The resolution's appendix cites several government and private groups and 12 people as involved in those programs; interrupting foreign involvement with those groups and individuals is also part of the new campaign.\nBut American officials have no figures on the value of international business done with those cited in the resolution.\nThe United States and European officials said they had also begun trying maneuvers aimed at undermining the self-assurance of Iranian officials, especially those who travel abroad.\nThe recent arrests of four Iranian diplomats by American troops in Iraq, the officials said, played into that strategy. Pentagon officials said the Iranians were suspected of transferring improvised explosive devices from Iran to Iraq. Iran complained loudly that the men were diplomats and that their arrest violated accepted diplomatic rules. The diplomats, two of whom American officials said were probably members of the Revolutionary Guard, were eventually released.\nBut their arrests are ''precisely the type of thing that will chip away at their confidence,'' one European official said. Most of the Western officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the issue.\nEven before the new effort began, the slowdown in international business was already emerging as a problem for Iran, which has vast oil fields but relatively little refining capacity. It imports 43 percent of its gasoline, according to the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, a Washington-based nonprofit group that follows energy issues.\nIn a rare acknowledgment of difficulty, the Iranian oil minister, Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh, told the ministry's news agency, Shana, recently that Iran was encountering obstacles in financing oil projects. ''Currently, overseas banks and financiers have decreased their cooperation,'' Mr. Vaziri-Hamaneh told the agency.\nIran is already seeking to secure gasoline imports from its allies, including Venezuela, and shifting some dependency from gasoline to natural gas.\n''Definitely, the Iranian economy is suffering a great deal as a result of the economic punishment,'' said Gal Luft, the executive director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security. But he added that Mr. Ahmadinejad ''is not just sitting on his hands and waiting.''\nThe new strategy comes in part because few believe that the sanctions resolution that passed Dec. 23 has the muscle to sway Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, which it insists are focused on energy production, not weapons. The road to sanctions was a tortuous one, filled with wrangling between the United States, which pushed for tough measures, and Russia, which advocated weaker measures.\nUnited States and European officials said they might still try to include tougher sanctions through the United Nations in the months ahead. But they say the West will need to use other measures as well.\nSpecifically, the United States will press France, Germany, Italy and other European countries to halt credits that encourage doing business in Iran. The German Ministry of Economics, in a credit program called Hermes, says on a Web site that Iran is among ''risky markets, which are also growth markets,'' identified for such credits.
1815944	At the Party, Urging a Sin-Free New Year	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03EED61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	It was about an hour before 2007, and Gina Raskin of Tempe, Ariz., had a question for the slight, bearded man with a bullhorn, a large sign warning of hell and a baseball cap that read ''Repent Pervert.''\n''Why are you even here?'' Ms. Raskin asked the man, Robert Ephrata, a fundamentalist preacher, as they stood amid the chaos of the Strip, where many revelers were nursing open containers of alcohol, some wearing clothing so skimpy Britney Spears might blush.\nMr. Ephrata, a fixture of New Year's Eve on the Strip for the past four years, smiled. He knew he was an odd sight. He and about 30 loosely affiliated itinerant preachers bank on their incongruity when they show up each year here and, the next morning, at the Rose Bowl Parade in Pasadena, Calif., to recite Scripture and issue warnings of an approaching apocalypse.\n''I am here because I love you enough to warn you that if you do not alter your wicked ways, you will go to hell and I don't want you to go to hell,'' Mr. Ephrata responded in a soothing voice. ''I am here because I love you.'' And because the crowds here and in Pasadena combine for the year's biggest audience for his message.\n''Where else can you preach to a combined 3.1 million people in such a short period of time?'' asked Mr. Ephrata, 55, who said he was raised Roman Catholic near Puget Sound and lived a wild life of drugs and sex in the 1960s. He cites a motorcycle accident in his mid-20s as ''quite literally my Damascus road moment,'' in which he turned more intensely to faith.\nSingle, Mr. Ephrata lives in a modest home he owns in Bellingham, Wash., where he leads the Fairhaven Believers Fellowship, a small fundamentalist congregation. Modeling himself after the Apostle Paul, who sold tents to finance his traveling ministry, Mr. Ephrata earns money as a contract carpenter and spends it traveling to dozens of events a year, like Mardi Gras in New Orleans and Mormon conventions in Salt Lake City. Last year he took his message to Africa.\nHe and the other preachers left Las Vegas at 1 a.m. Monday and drove 250 miles west, arriving at 8 a.m. to walk the Rose Bowl Parade route. Although not officially sanctioned by parade organizers, groups of fundamentalist preachers have been attending the parade for decades, Mr. Ephrata said. Later they stood outside the Rose Bowl.\nThe flavor of the events here and in Pasadena could not be more different, he said. The Strip is overwhelmed by hedonistic masses committing a litany of sins, he said, who can be dangerously belligerent as they get more drunk. The Rose Bowl Parade offers a family-friendly atmosphere where few spectators are confrontational.\nMr. Ephrata stood on the Strip with his 3-by-5-foot placard reading ''Got Jesus? It's Hell Without Him'' late Sunday night, amid a stream of expletives aimed at him and the three other preachers nearby. The group left an hour earlier than planned because people were hitting them, he said, and throwing ice and drinks.\nBryan York of Dallas was glad to see them go. ''They make me so mad, the nerve of them,'' said Mr. York, who is gay and made a point of kissing his boyfriend in front of Mr. Ephrata. ''How dare they judge other people?''\nMr. Ephrata said he had altered his tactics for this trip to the Strip. In years past, he was on his bullhorn insisting that people were damned and that the Southeast Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina were examples of God's anger. This year, he said, he found that answering people calmly and telling them that he worried about them was more likely to yield a productive conversation.\nIt did not always work. One intoxicated woman whose breasts were almost completely exposed harangued him until he could not restrain himself.\n''Go home and put some clothes on,'' Mr. Ephrata told her angrily. ''You're causing me to sin by looking at your breasts. You are dressed that way on purpose. Go and sin no more, woman. Go and sin no more.''
1815945	In the Long Run, Great Arms Mean Big Risks	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEED61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Pete Seeger wrote it and Peter, Paul and Mary sang it and made it hugely popular during the Vietnam War. It could apply to the war in Iraq, but the refrain in ''Where Have All the Flowers Gone'' applies to baseball as well:\n''When will they ever learn? When will they ever learn?''\nThe owners, that is. When will they learn that long-term contracts for pitchers seldom work?\nWhen Lee MacPhail was retiring in the mid-1980s as head of Major League Baseball's labor committee, he wrote a memo to the clubs cautioning against such contracts. The memo wound up as a central piece of evidence in the players' successful collusion case against the owners, but the owners evidently did not get any smarter and thus did not get anything for the $280 million that three collusion cases cost them.\nLatest case in point: the San Francisco Giants' seven-year, $126 million contract for Barry Zito. The Giants can boast all they want about Zito's durability, his six successive seasons of more than 200 innings and 34 or 35 starts, his history of never having been on the disabled list or even missing a start. It's still a dumb contract.\nMaybe the contract makes sense to the Giants for business and strategic reasons, that even if he doesn't pitch all seven seasons, it's worth it to them because they needed a focus other than Barry Bonds and his potential legal troubles.\nThe Mets were criticized two years ago for signing Pedro Martínez for four years. But the Mets wanted to change the culture of the team. They were also dealing with one extra year for $11.5 million. Who knows how much and how many years the Zito contract could cost the Giants should he sustain a devastating injury or a series of injuries?\nAs much as the Mets wanted a pitcher of Zito's talent, General Manager Omar Minaya opted not to urge Fred Wilpon to pay $18 million a year for seven years. The Yankees weren't prepared to do that, either. Not even Tom Hicks, the Rangers' owner and Scott Boras's favorite victim, went for it.\nBut applying a variation of the theme of the greater-fools theory on the sale of franchises, there will always be someone willing to pay more than the previous buyer paid. There will always be someone willing to give Boras what he wants for his star clients.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers gave Kevin Brown a seven-year contract for $105 million before the 1999 season -- when he was 34 -- but he pitched more than 132 innings in only one of the final five years of the contract, the last two with the Yankees, and he pitched the equivalent of five seasons out of the seven. He was on the disabled list 11 times.\nThe Rangers signed a Boras client, Chan Ho Park, to a five-year, $65 million contract. At the time, he was 28, the age Zito is now. In his first three seasons, Park was on the disabled list more than he was on the mound. He didn't pitch more than 155 innings in any of the five seasons, the last season and a half with San Diego.\nThere have been exceptions to the curse of the long-term pitching contract, namely Greg Maddux (five years, $57.5 million, Braves), Martínez (six years, $75 million, Red Sox) and Mike Mussina (six years, $88.5 million, Yankees). The Giants can only hope that Zito joins them.\nBut he could also join Mike Hampton, Denny Neagle, Darren Dreifort, Mark Prior and A. J. Burnett.\nColorado signed Hampton and Neagle five days apart six years ago, Hampton for eight years and $121 million, Neagle for five years and $51 million. Hampton was that magic age, 28, had pitched more than 200 innings each of the previous four seasons and had averaged 33 starts in that period.\nHe was dreadful for two years with the Rockies, then wound up in Atlanta, where he missed much of 2005 with arm and back problems and all of last season after having Tommy John surgery.\nNeagle barely made it through two years of his contract, pitching a combined 335 innings in those seasons, then lasting only 35 innings in 2003 and pitching not at all in 2004 because of a series of injuries. An arrest for solicitation of a prostitute wiped out the fifth season.\nWant more? The Dodgers signed Dreifort, a Boras client, no less, to a five-year, $55 million contract for 2001. Injuries cost him two of those seasons, and he pitched 205 innings in the other three combined.\nPrior was only 21 and a future great when the Cubs gave him a five-year, $10.5 million contract. He became rich but not great as a series of injuries limited him to a total of 657 innings, an average of 131 a season, and 106 starts, an average of 21 a season.\nBurnett had a rough start to the five-year, $55 million contract he signed with Toronto a year ago, elbow problems reducing him to 21 starts and 135 innings.\nAnd then there was Wayne Garland, a more remote but nonetheless relevant example. A 20-game winner with Baltimore in 1976, his fourth season in the majors, Garland, two years from 28, was in the first class of free agents. Cleveland signed him to a stunning 10-year contract for $2.3 million, a lot of money then.\nGarland lasted only half the contract, making 38 starts and pitching 282 innings in his first season with the Indians but starting 50 games and pitching 330 innings in the next four injury-troubled years before the Indians released him.\n''I wasn't worth the money,'' Garland said candidly the year after his release. ''No one is. But if they are willing to pay it, I'm willing to take it.''\nTwenty-five years later, Zito adopted the same philosophy.\nBASEBALL
1815946	Broken Neck Can't Keep Skier Off Course	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CEED61630F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Dane Spencer plunged out of the clouds at more than 70 miles an hour. It was Feb. 14, 2006, a foggy day at The Big Mountain ski resort in northwestern Montana, and Spencer, a member of the United States ski team, was trying to win a downhill race to relieve the frustration of not having qualified for the Winter Olympics.\nSpencer, then 28, swooped toward a jump called the Launch Pad, where skiers routinely fly more than 100 feet. He carved a precise turn that most young racers at the event could only envy.\nJim Dusing, an emergency physician from nearby Kalispell who was volunteering at the event, watched from a spot just above the jump as Spencer's skis then sliced a long arc, their razor-sharp edges disengaging from the snow and hitting the jump's abrupt lip. Spencer's weight was off balance as he cleared the jump. From his vantage point, Dusing could see that disaster was afoot.\n''When he left the ground, I could tell he wasn't going to be able to land that one,'' Dusing said in a recent telephone interview.\nSpencer awoke five days later to a new world filled with pain, fear and drug-induced confusion. He could not recall the crash. Even now, when he tries to remember anything from the subsequent weeks, there is ''quite a bit of blank tape,'' he said in a recent telephone interview.\nHe had broken his neck in the landing, shattering the cervical spine at the C2 vertebra, an often fatal injury that is known as a hangman's fracture. The actor Christopher Reeve broke his C2 vertebra (along with the C1) in a horse-riding accident, paralyzing him permanently. But the fragments of Spencer's spine spread outward, away from the spinal cord, saving him from possible paralysis.\nDusing and ski patrol personnel were able to quickly stabilize Spencer's spine and open an airway with plastic tubes. He was rushed to a hospital in Kalispell, where doctors treated massive internal bleeding from a pelvic fracture and a partly blown-out lung.\nCritical to his recovery, they screwed a metal halo device into Spencer's skull and anchored it to his chest. This prevented him from moving his neck and severing the spinal cord, a delicate bundle of nerves the consistency of toothpaste.\nSpencer's longtime girlfriend, Jasmine Furnish, had been waiting at the bottom of the mountain to share a postrace Valentine's Day lunch with him. Instead, she spent the first of many nightmarish nights beside his hospital bed.\n''We didn't know if he could do normal things like walk, to turn his neck side to side, or swallow,'' she said. Visitors would try to comfort her by observing that at least Spencer would not be able to ski again. ''But that was my worst nightmare,'' she said, ''that it wouldn't be on his terms.''\nFor Spencer, a fiercely independent athlete, the next month was physically and emotionally painful. He suffered terrible pain from his pelvis injury and had to rely on others to bathe and feed him. A month after the accident, Spencer had five hours of surgery. Dr. Christian Zimmerman, the lead surgeon, moved Spencer's trachea and esophagus to the left and his carotid artery and jugular vein to the right. He also discovered an injury so complex that he was shocked Spencer had lived.\n''The bones were basically just flopping in the breeze,'' Zimmerman said. ''Biomechanical studies on bone breakage have shown that it takes probably somewhere around 500 to 1,000 pounds per square inch of pressure to actually fracture those bones, and his C2 was broken in at least four places.''\nIn the month after the operation, Spencer's weight fell to 165 pounds from 198. He was kept immobile and counted down the minutes between pain pills, Furnish said.\nBut by May, Spencer's pelvis had healed enough for him to bear weight and from that moment, he was irrepressible, Furnish said. ''The second he could, he wanted to go everywhere,'' she said.\nOn Nov. 9, Spencer returned to skiing.\n''It was definitely a little frightening at first,'' he said. ''But I couldn't stop smiling once I made those first couple sliding turns down. I really wanted to do it again. Then I went back to the gym and started working even harder.''\nSpencer is now living in Park City, Utah, training with junior racers there and rebuilding muscle as fast as he can.\nHe hopes to return to the World Cup circuit in March right before this ski season ends or in time for next year's season. Whenever he does return, Spencer will be carrying titanium equipment buried deep in his neck. A screw holds the bones together, and the C2 vertebra is fused to the one beneath it, bolstering Spencer's spine and slightly reducing the range of motion available to him as he swivels his head.\nUndamaged is his wry humor. When told that some who witnessed the crash said it should have made him swear off skiing, he said, ''Maybe that was the side benefit of getting knocked unconscious and not remembering any of it.''\nBut for Spencer, perhaps the most valuable benefit has been learning to embrace the support and assistance of others.\n''In a lot of ways, there's been more good than bad,'' Spencer said. ''Losing a few degrees of range of motion is not that bad when you learn to appreciate the people around you.''\nSKIING
1815947	Time for Change, or Was That the Last Inaugural?	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E7DF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	And there was evening, and there was morning: the first day.\nSorry, sorry. It's just that it is hard not to get biblical when talking about our new governor, Eliot Spitzer.\nFor so long, he has been treated by New York's political and chattering classes as if he were Savior, Messiah and Mahdi, rolled into one. Inadvertently, a touch of Genesis slipped in after listening to him announce yesterday, in his characteristic returned-from-Sinai cadences, that ''Day 1 of our time for change has arrived.''\nLooking to the future, the brand-new governor said in his inaugural address: ''The people seek change. Let us give them sweeping and fundamental change that is certain and immediate.''\nOops. Sorry again. Got my notes mixed up. Mr. Spitzer didn't say those last two sentences. His message was the same. But the actual words came from Gov. George E. Pataki's first inaugural speech, 12 years ago.\nMr. Spitzer also said yesterday that the November election was not about him but about New Yorkers' collective desire for the future. ''The outcome,'' he said, ''was not so much a personal vindication as it was the judgment of the people of New York'' on the policies and principles that underpinned his candidacy.\nOh boy. Sorry once more. Those were indeed Mr. Spitzer's sentiments. But the language belonged to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo at his first inauguration, in 1983.\nAs you can see, everything may change on Day 1 -- except perhaps for an obligatory pledge from the new person in charge that henceforth all will be different.\nWho knows? Maybe ethically and metabolically challenged Albany is indeed headed for a metamorphosis. But Mr. Spitzer may do well to remember Mr. Cuomo's admonition years ago that while politicians ''campaign in poetry,'' they must then ''govern in prose.''\nNot that there has been much poetry coming from Mr. Spitzer (or, for that matter, from any other major New York politician of recent vintage). His phrases lean more toward the lawyerly than the lofty, although he sought yesterday to evoke memories of one of the great inaugural addresses, that of President John F. Kennedy in 1961.\nWhat New York needs, the governor said, is ''a politics that asks not what is in it for me, but always what is in it for us.''\nThat channeling of Kennedy served, no doubt unintentionally, as a counterpoint to an echo of Richard M. Nixon emanating, also unintentionally, from Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority leader. Mr. Bruno's business dealings are being investigated by the F.B.I. ''I am guilty of nothing,'' he said as 2006 wound down. That may be true. It was difficult, nonetheless, not to think of Nixon's ''I'm not a crook'' line.\nWhatever its outcome, the Bruno inquiry reinforces the degree to which Albany, as Mr. Spitzer suggested yesterday, has been on snooze alarm for much of the last decade. That is certainly the case when it comes to ethical behavior.\nWith at least a dozen elected officials having been investigated, arrested, indicted or jailed in the last few years, the state capital is almost as crime-ridden as Dodge City on a Saturday night. The situation is such that the inauguration ceremony yesterday might well have been covered live by Court TV, perhaps with Bernard B. Kerik providing the color commentary.\nInto this mess steps a new governor whose well-publicized investigations as attorney general led some to call him ''the sheriff of Wall Street.'' It is a cliché favored by the same types who insist on referring to Rudolph W. Giuliani as ''America's mayor.''\nThe two men share certain traits. Both are highly intelligent and determined to succeed. Both also seem to believe in their intellectual and moral superiority, and have shown a capacity for vindictiveness. ''The world's smartest man'' was Representative Charles B. Rangel's description of Mr. Spitzer. It wasn't said admiringly.\nAs with Mr. Giuliani, the veneration of Mr. Spitzer has its skeptics. Those who see the new governor as having at least one foot of clay already note his appointed secretary of state, a lobbyist for Cablevision with roots in the Bronx Democratic machine. Maybe not everything changes on Day 1, after all.\nFortunately for Mr. Spitzer, he has time to work whatever miracles he has in mind. Yesterday, there was evening, and today there is morning: the second day. Way back when, that was the day the waters parted above and below the firmament.\nNYC E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com
1815948	In Response to Post-9/11 Concerns, Pataki Is Granted 24-Hour Security	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E6DF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	George E. Pataki, who became a private citizen yesterday, will be assigned a 24-hour security detail, a privilege rarely offered to a former governor.\nA spokesman for Mr. Pataki, David Catalfamo, said that Mr. Pataki's staff had asked the state police, which provides security to governors while they are in office, to evaluate whether Mr. Pataki would need security after leaving office.\n''We asked whether or not it would be necessary going forward, and they said it would be,'' Mr. Catalfamo said. He said it would cost the state about $20,000 a week, and possibly more, depending on the number of state police officers assigned to the job. Mr. Catalfamo would not comment specifically on the level of security that would be provided.\nGov. Eliot Spitzer also approved the arrangement, said Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer.\n''They'll take the steps to make sure that he has sufficient security,'' she said.\nMr. Catalfamo noted that Mr. Pataki was the first governor to leave office since the Sept. 11 attack. ''I think there's a greater awareness and sensitivity of the security of New York governors and elected officials in a post-9/11 government,'' he said.\nHe added that the arrangement would most likely be temporary, and would be re-evaluated by state police officials each month. He also said the state police would probably seek additional advice on the matter from outside law enforcement agencies, like the United States Secret Service.\nNews of Mr. Pataki's security detail was reported yesterday by The New York Post.\nMr. Catalfamo said the security arrangement was also approved by the State Ethics Commission, which last year sharply criticized State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi for his use of state employees as chauffeurs and aides to his wife, who he claimed needed security. Mr. Hevesi was re-elected in November, but agreed last month to resign and plead guilty to one felony charge.\nMr. Pataki's detail will be limited to him alone, and will not include coverage for members of his family.\nNeither Mr. Catalfamo nor Ms. Anderson was certain whether any past governor was granted a security detail after leaving office, and a spokesman for the state police was not available for comment yesterday.\nBut the last two New York City mayors, David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani, enjoyed a similar privilege. The Police Department provided each with a temporary security detail after he left office, according to a department spokesman.
1815949	Cautiously, Economists Expect an Upswing	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E6DF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	By the end of 2006, Wall Street had every reason to celebrate. A second-half rally propelled the stock market to its best year since 2003. Companies reported strong profits, and some, like oil producers and investment banks, had record-shattering earnings.\nYet the year had a more precarious beginning. Worries were rampant that a slowdown in housing would hurt the overall economy and that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates and stall growth. But the economy proved resilient, withstanding a housing slump. The Fed halted its campaign for higher interest rates. Profits accelerated, and there was a huge wave of mergers and acquisitions.\nNonetheless, Wall Street economists are looking at 2007 with some caution. They expect at least some slowdown in economic growth. And many worry that housing's slump will spread to other corners of the economy.\nThe analysts surveyed predicted that the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which closed 2006 at 1,418.30, would end 2007 at 1,440 to 1,570.\nRichard Bernstein Chief Investment Strategist Merrill Lynch\nThough concerns mount that the world is suffering from global warming, Richard Bernstein is content to call himself a ''bipolar bear.'' While he foresees returns rising 12 percent over the coming year -- and the S.& P. hitting 1,570 by the end of the year -- Mr. Bernstein expects increased volatility. That is in large part because the Fed will not ease, or lower rates, in January, he says.\n''As the uncertainty about the Fed easing has gone up, you've found that the market has become choppier,'' he said.\nMr. Bernstein cautioned that he expected growth in gross domestic product to be a full percentage point below other estimates, citing in part a ''money illusion'' over the growth in the Dow and even in energy prices.\nInvestors should watch earnings carefully, he said. ''There's sort of an embedded assumption that earnings will be going great forever.''\nMr. Bernstein recommends a mix of 50 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 20 percent cash for investors' portfolios. Among sectors to watch, Mr. Bernstein rated telecommunications as a growth sector, aided by increasing attractiveness in European and Asian companies. ''It's one of our turnaround sectors,'' he said.\nHe is bearish on energy and commodities, citing their cyclical nature.\nAbby Joseph Cohen Chief Investment Strategist Goldman Sachs\nThe coming year looks to be reasonable, if a little slow, said Abby Joseph Cohen, long one of Wall Street's optimists.\n''We are assuming profit growth is in the process of deceleration,'' she said. ''Especially in the case of energy companies, we expect that they will show gains for 2007, but they will not show as much of a boost as in previous years.''\nStill, Ms. Cohen said, her team's research indicates that the S.& P. is underpriced, pointing to a 12-month target of 1,550. Buoyed by the Fed's halt in raising interest rates, merger activity should keep rolling, but with more of a focus on international expansion.\nWith the slowdown in housing, the economy will rotate toward discretionary consumer services, like travel, restaurants and entertainment, she said. Large-capitalization industrials and information technology may also see favorable growth. Over all, Ms. Cohen said, the economy should run well, with no real bumps in the way.\nDavid Bianco Chief U.S. Equity Strategist UBS Investment Research\nDavid Bianco remembers a scary moment from last summer, as he and others feared that the Fed might tighten interest rates. Since then, the stock market has recovered and that forward momentum should carry over into 2007, he said.\n''We'll continue to see P/E expansion,'' Mr. Bianco said of price-to-earnings ratios, ''mostly driven by everybody's fears of a weakening economy not taking place.''\nMr. Bianco said that he expects the Fed to cut interest rates in March, setting a fairly steady metronome for slowing but solid growth and a target S.& P. of 1,500 by year-end.\nLike Ms. Cohen, Mr. Bianco said that he sees the S.& P. as relatively undervalued. Despite the flurry of merger activity in 2006, he believes that the S.& P. has been using less than half of its debt capacity, something he expects to be corrected.\nHousing will continue to slow and prices will fall further, taking consumer-related spending and industries like autos along with it, he said.\nAbhijit Chakrabortti Chief U.S. and Global Equity Strategist J. P. Morgan Chase\nLast year can be summed up in one phrase, according to Abhijit Chakrabortti: Value killed growth.\n''If you had that the S.& P. would be up for the year, you would have said that tech, industrials and health care would kill value stocks,'' he said. ''But telecoms and utilities were the big winners.''\nComing off a surprisingly good 2006, however, Mr. Chakrabortti is distinctly bearish. He sees slower growth in the United States compared with Asia and Europe. Volatility will pick up as earnings slow down, he added, and the dollar will weaken.\nThe Fed will hold steady, Mr. Chakrabortti said, but other central banks will tighten.\nHe predicts the S.& P. will rise to 1,440 -- the low end of targets among the analysts surveyed.\n''I very much suspect that there will be a time when a 1,440 valuation looks good,'' he said. ''The market will be disappointed with the Fed, and we'll see a significant correction sometime in the first half.''\nEthan S. Harris Chief U.S. Economist Lehman Brothers\nEthan S. Harris said he was less surprised than most by the resilience of the stock market last year. He expects 2007 to be a growth year, albeit one without the boom that marked the last half of 2006.\n''There's still room for the market to rally,'' he said. To that end, he staked an S.& P. price target of 1,570, thanks in large part to the economy shrugging off the housing slump.\nBut he also said he did not expect a completely rosy economic picture. Alone among economists surveyed, Mr. Harris talked about the possibility of ''a very mild version of stagflation.'' Moreover, he gave recession a 20 percent chance to appear in 2007.\nTHE YEAR AHEAD IN MARKETS
1815950	Middle-Class French Join Sleep-In Over Homelessness	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Hundreds of people emerged from tents beside this city's Canal St.-Martin to greet the chilly New Year with a hot lunch from a nearby soup kitchen. But not all of them were homeless.\nDozens of otherwise well-housed, middle-class French have been spending nights in tents along the canal, in the 10th Arrondissement, in solidarity with the country's growing number of ''sans domicile fixe,'' or ''without fixed address,'' the French euphemism for people living on the street. The bleak yet determinedly cheerful sleep-in is meant to embarrass the French government into doing something about the problem.\n''Each person should have the minimum dignity in a country as rich as this,'' said Bleunwenn Manrot, a 28-year-old with a newsboy cap on her head and a toothbrush in her hand. Ms. Manrot drove more than six hours with friends from her home in Carhaix, Brittany, to spend New Year's Eve along the canal.\nThe demonstration has drawn enough media attention over the holidays for President Jacques Chirac to acknowledge it during his traditional New Year address to the nation on Sunday. He asked the government to work in the coming weeks to ''put in place a truly enforceable right to housing'' that would give the homeless the legal means to demand a place to live.\nGiven France's well-financed social services, the country's homeless problem is relatively mild -- the national statistics bureau estimated the number of people living without a fixed address on any one night at 86,000 for all of France in 2004, about equal to the number of homeless in Los Angeles alone.\nBut even that number is disturbing for the socially active segment of France's population. In December 2005, the French affiliate of the international charity Doctors of the World began distributing nylon pup tents to people who sleep on Paris's sidewalks and beneath its bridges. The movement took hold, and since then the tents have become a fixture in odd corners of the city.\nIn an effort to increase pressure on politicians, another group, Don Quixote's Children, marshaled some of the tent dwellers last year to set up their tents along the Canal St.-Martin, in the heart of ''bobo'' (short for bourgeois bohemian) Paris. The canal was dug by Napoleon to supply Paris with clean drinking water. Since mid-December, the encampment has become a happening in one of Paris's most happening neighborhoods.\n''There are 250 tents now,'' said Jean-Baptiste Legrand, the organization's president. ''The people keep coming, and the tents are full.''\nThe protest has started to spread to other cities, including Orléans, Toulouse and Lyon, and has been picked up by politicians as the presidential campaign gets under way.\nFrançois Hollande, the leader of the Socialist Party, and Bertrand Delanoë, the mayor of Paris, have signed the group's petition calling for a solution to the housing problem. Both of the leading presidential candidates -- Nicolas Sarkozy, of the governing Union for a Popular Movement, and Ségolène Royal of the Socialists -- support the cause.\nCatherine Vautrin, the minister for social cohesion, met with Mr. Legrand and other members of his group and last week announced a tenfold increase in spending to help the homeless, to $92 million from $9 million. She said the money would allow homeless shelters to stay open around the clock on weekends and extend their weekday opening by three hours a day.\nBut a legally enforceable right to housing is the biggest prize sought by housing activists, including Don Quixote's Children, and they remain skeptical of Mr. Chirac's New Year promise. France already has a hard time housing new immigrants and asylum seekers. Fires in overcrowded, substandard lodgings have caused scandals in recent years. Finding a place for the hardcore homeless is certain to complicate those problems.\n''Chirac's speech means nothing,'' said Ms. Manrot, the Brittany protester.\nSuch comments suggest that the long camp-out will continue. Organizers have arranged portable toilets and a soup kitchen to keep the ad hoc village operating. Vans of blankets and other supplies arrive regularly, much of the material donated by Parisians. Volunteers sweep the canal-side cobblestones to keep the area clean.\n''I like the protest because it's nonviolent,'' said another protester, Renaud Huvé, 39, a photographer. ''It's a citizens' call.''\nSo far, the authorities have been tolerant, though they have quietly evicted tent dwellers before, when the news media were not watching. The police broke up one encampment under a bridge farther north along the canal in October.\nMagali Marx, 23, a sales assistant in a clothes shop, expressed the laissez-faire attitude of the neighborhood's residents as she passed by. ''It's a bit of a pain for the people who want to walk along the side of the canal,'' she said. ''But then, these people don't have a roof.''\nNot all of the homeless are down-and-out French. A group of immigrants continues to live farther up the canal beneath what people in the area have dubbed ''the bridge of the Afghans.'' The government says that a third of the country's homeless hold jobs.\nThe homeless who make up the bulk of the canal-side campers are thankful for the attention. ''Let's hope it makes a difference,'' said Jean, a middle-aged man who said he had been living on the streets of Paris for eight years.\nBut staying on the street is anything but restful for those who have a warm bed waiting at home.

1815951	Romania and Bulgaria Celebrate Entry Into European Union	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E4DF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union on Monday, helping to end geographic divisions left over from the cold war and extending the borders of the now 27-member bloc eastward to the Black Sea.\nIn Bucharest, Romania, President Traian Basescu said Sunday night that the entry into the European Union signaled the end of a painful 17-year process. ''We arrived in Europe, welcome to Europe,'' he said to rapturous applause from a crowd in University Square. ''This is an enormous chance for new generations.''\nIn Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, revelers gathered in Battenberg Square. Fireworks filled the sky over the building where the Communist Party once had its headquarters. ''We are home!'' said a headline in the Bulgarian newspaper Trud.\nRomania and Bulgaria, now the European Union's poorest members, hope that membership will help them raise their per capita wealth, which is one-third of the Union average. Their accession, the second wave of enlargement into formerly Communist Eastern Europe, will also give the Union a stable political and economic anchor in an unstable region.\nRomania, with a population of about 22 million, becomes the European Union's seventh largest member. Bulgaria has a population of 7.7 million.\nFor Romania, which suffered one of Eastern Europe's most brutal Communist dictatorships under Nicolae Ceausescu before he was overthrown in 1989, being moored to the European Union is an important symbolic final break with a difficult past. For Bulgaria, whose history is marked by conflicts with the Ottoman Empire and Soviet occupation, European membership is also viewed as a source of economic and democratic stability.\nThe European Union has been experiencing expansion fatigue, though, after the bloc's enlargement in May 2004 to 25 countries from 15. With the latest additions, the Union has a population of nearly 489 million.\nSome members, like France, are concerned that the addition of member nations with much lower per capita incomes, the European Union will become economically overburdened, institutionally unwieldy and ultimately unmanageable. They fear that expansion will diminish their power while paralyzing the European Union's decision-making process.\nWariness about the future shape of the Union was reflected in French and Dutch rejections of a proposed European constitution in referendums in 2005. Since then, there have been calls across the bloc for a slowing of the pace of enlargement.\nSuch ambivalence, stoked by fears of immigration and Europe's lackluster economic performance, has been most prominently expressed in opposition to admitting Turkey, which is Muslim. It has also cast a shadow over the admission of Romania and Bulgaria, which have been criticized for corruption that has lingered since Communist times.\nSome countries, though, led by Britain, with the enthusiastic backing of the United States, have supported further expansion because the promise of membership has helped accelerate economic and political change in Europe, ranging from the arrest of war criminals in Croatia to the liberalization of Turkey's banking industry.\nThe cautious approach to further expansion was reflected in the tough conditions imposed on Romania and Bulgaria for entry.\nEven now that they are in the Union, the two countries will be subject to unprecedented safeguards devised to keep them from backtracking. They include the power by the European Commission, the union's executive, to suspend some of the rights that come with membership, like generous economic aid.\nThe commission has also threatened to suspend recognition of arrest warrants and decisions made by Bulgarian courts if the country does not improve its judicial system.\nRomania expects to receive as much as $ 2.2 billion in the first year after entry, while Bulgaria would be entitled to $873 million.\nThe European Union has been grappling with fears that westward migration from its poorer members in the east risks undermining the bloc's social standards.\nAt the time of the last enlargement, in May 2004, the European Commission estimated that the number of migrants throughout the bloc would total 70,000 to 150,000 a year. But Britain alone is estimated to have received up to 600,000 in the past three years.\nBritain, Sweden and Ireland, which opened their doors to European Union newcomers in 2004, have already signaled that they are less inclined to do so now. Romanians and Bulgarians may also face obstacles in labor markets in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, which are themselves confronting restrictions by countries further west.\nAt a recent meeting in Brussels, European leaders toughened their tone on enlargement but stopped short of setting new hurdles to expansion. They reaffirmed backing for the eventual membership of Turkey, Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.
1815952	A Man's Place at a Woman's Practice	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E4DF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	At many colleges in the United States, the sexes can be found battling on courts and fields, where coaches have taken to pitting female student-athletes against male students in practices.\nThe idea is that the men are bigger, stronger and faster than the women and can provide more rigorous opposition.\nBut if the N.C.A.A.'s committee on women's athletics has its way, the use of men in practices will soon end.\nThe committee has said the practice violates the spirit of Title IX and is creating fewer opportunities for women. It issued a position statement last month calling for a ban on the use of men in practices in all intercollegiate women's sports. Though the practice is most common in basketball, it has spread to other sports, including volleyball, softball and soccer.\n''To have talented, capable female student-athletes stand on the sidelines during official practice while the team's starters practice against 'more talented men' is a lost opportunity,'' the committee said in the statement. ''To have them sitting out of practice while a full 'scout team' of men practices is costing them opportunity for growth and betterment that they were promised during recruitment.''\nThe committee further contended that the use of men, who are usually students who played high school sports but are not good enough to make college men's teams, is ''an archaic notion of male pre-eminence that continues to impede progress toward gender equity and inclusion.''\nSince the proposal was announced, several high-profile women's basketball coaches have spoken publicly in opposition. At the Division I level, a majority of the basketball teams use men in practices.\n''I have not heard any players or coaches voice a concern over this,'' Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma said. ''I've not spoken to a single coach who thinks their team or players would benefit from this move. I don't understand the rationale or why they are so gung-ho about changing this.\n''You can attribute the growth of the game to the development of the players, and player development has a lot to do with the competition they face every day in practice. Using male practice players has done a lot for the growth of the game and the development of the players. Why would they choose now to fool around with it? I have no idea.''\nPatrick Nero, the commissioner of the America East Conference and a member of the committee on women's athletics, said he believed the central issue was not whether men helped teams and players improve but rather how their use limited opportunities and even roster spots for thousands of women.\nIn Division I, women's basketball teams are allowed 15 scholarships, but many top teams have fewer players on their roster. Nero said the reason was that extra women were no longer needed for practices.\n''People think the issue is solely a practice time issue; it's not,'' Nero said. ''All you have to do is to look at some of the quotes that have come out from some leading women's college basketball coaches, who are saying this allows them to carry only 10 or 11 players. That's scary. You multiply four or five spots per team and per institution and you're talking about thousands of lost opportunities and lost scholarships. Look at the top 25 rosters in women's basketball, and it seems like everyone is carrying 10 or 11 players. They seem to think that is a more manageable number.''\nMaryland, the top-ranked team in the country, lists 11 players on its roster. North Carolina, the No. 2 team, has 13 on its roster and No. 3 Duke has 11. Fifth-ranked Connecticut has 13 and St. John's has 12.\nThe America East still allows men in practices, but now requires its women's basketball teams to use all 15 scholarships.\nLegislation to ban the practice at the Division III level will be voted on at the N.C.A.A.'s annual convention Jan. 11-15 in Indianapolis. In the meantime, representatives from Divisions I and II continue to gather feedback on proposed bans at their levels.\nAccording to several coaches, the use of men in Division III basketball is less prevalent than in Division I, but the dissatisfaction among coaches over the proposed rule change is universal.\n''Using the male players is simply a tool to allow these student-athletes to perform to their maximum potential,'' said Lori Kerans, the women's coach at Millikin University, a Division III program in Decatur, Ill.\n''To me, my using the male players is not unlike any other tool we use, like video or weight lifting. We have a difficult time finding women in our program who can replicate the strength and speed that a male student can play at. It's not about anything other than getting our team to perform at their best against an opponent.''\nAlly James may be the type of player that the committee hopes to help. A sophomore guard, she has appeared in only two games this season for Millikin and has not scored. But she said she did not want a ban on the use of men in practice.\n''I don't think they are bad for anybody,'' James said. ''Standing on the sidelines in practice, I find that I learn a lot from what the other players in practice are doing. They don't even take up much of our practice time. It's not like they're there the entire practice. I hope that when I'm playing more as a junior or senior, I'll get to go up against them and they'll help me improve. I want what's best for my team. I'm all for it.''\nBASKETBALL

1815954	AS IRAQIS FLEE, FEW ARE GAINING SANCTUARY IN U.S.	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E3DF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	With thousands of Iraqis desperately fleeing this country every day, advocates for refugees, and even some American officials, say there is an urgent need to allow more Iraqi refugees into the United States.\nUntil recently the Bush administration had planned to resettle just 500 Iraqis this year, a mere fraction of the tens of thousands of Iraqis who are now believed to be fleeing their country each month. State Department officials say they are open to admitting larger numbers, but are limited by a cumbersome and poorly financed United Nations referral system.\n''We're not even meeting our basic obligation to the Iraqis who've been imperiled because they worked for the U.S. government,'' said Kirk W. Johnson, who worked for the United States Agency for International Development in Falluja in 2005. ''We could not have functioned without their hard work, and it's shameful that we've nothing to offer them in their bleakest hour.''\nSenator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who is taking over the immigration, border security and refugee subcommittee, plans hearings this month on America's responsibility to help vulnerable Iraqis. An estimated 1.8 million Iraqis are living outside Iraq. The pace of the exodus has quickened significantly in the past nine months.\nSome critics say the Bush administration has been reluctant to create a significant refugee program because to do so would be tantamount to conceding failure in Iraq. They say a major change in policy could happen only as part of a broader White House shift on Iraq.\n''I don't know of anyone inside the administration who sees this as a priority area,'' said Lavinia Limón, president of the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a nongovernmental refugee resettlement agency based in Washington. ''If you think you're winning, you think they're going to go back soon.''\nFor Iraqis, a tie to the United States is a life-threatening liability, particularly in harder-line Sunni neighborhoods. In 2003, Laith, an Army interpreter who would allow only his first name to be used, got a note threatening his family if he did not quit his job. His neighborhood, Adhamiya, was full of Baath Party loyalists. A month later, his father opened the door to a stranger, who shot him dead.\nLaith's mother begged him to stop working, but his salary, $700 a month at the time, supported the entire family. Then someone threw a sound grenade at the house. Graffiti appeared on a wall in ugly black paint accusing Laith of selling information about insurgents to the military. Laith and his family moved out of the house. Soon after, it was broken into and photographs of him with American soldiers were found in a family photo album.\n''They know me,'' he said, sitting in one of Baghdad's hotels, because his family would not allow a Western reporter inside the house. ''They know when I come and go.''\nMany Iraqis who worked for Americans have already fled the capital or the country, and many plead for help or asylum on a daily basis. Of some 40 nationalities seeking asylum in European countries in the first half of 2006, Iraqis ranked first with more than 8,100 applications, according to the United Nations.\nRemarkably few apply for refugee status in the United States, mainly because most Iraqis, even those who have worked for the United States government here, simply assume that getting American status is all but impossible. Iraqis cannot apply directly for refugee status in the American Embassy in Baghdad.\nAnother interpreter, Amar, who did not want his full name used, went to at least 10 embassies during a trip to Jordan last fall, but found only blank faces. He counts his sacrifice for America in bones and skin. He is missing a finger, an eye and part of his skull, after a large bomb exploded next to his Humvee last year. He has received two threats to his life. Two bodyguards accompany him everywhere. He stays in three different houses to confuse potential attackers.\n''They said they have nothing for Iraqis,'' said Amar, sitting in a small house in western Baghdad. ''We feel just like stupid trash.''\nUntil recently, the administration did not appear to understand the gravity of the problem. State Department officials say they are now open to increasing the number of refugee slots the administration formally requested for Iraqis in September. That request already allows for as many as 20,000 more refugees from unspecified countries.\nBut advocates for refugees say that such an increase is unlikely if no special measures are taken, namely designating Iraqis as a group in peril and formalizing a system for receiving them.\nEllen R. Sauerbrey, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, said the United States was hoping to identify the most vulnerable Iraqi refugees but was also dependent on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to do that.\nOfficials at the United Nations refugee branch acknowledge that they have moved slowly in identifying refugees, largely because of procedural obstacles and lack of money. The agency's budget for Syria last year was $700,000, less than one dollar for each Iraqi refugee in that country. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in October that its Iraq program was $9 million short and that some employees were going without salaries.\nThe State Department spent $35 million on Iraqi refugees in Iraq and the region in 2006. The United States spends approximately $8 billion a month on the war.\nBut there is no legal requirement for the United States to rely on the United Nations. It has run its own programs in the past, notably in Southeast Asia. Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese were ultimately resettled in the United States after the American withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975. In that instance, a number of aid groups in neighboring countries divided the work of interviewing and assessing refugees, a system Ms. Limón and many other advocates for refugees are pushing for Iraqis today.\nThe United States has even run similar programs in Iraq, helping to resettle about 40,000 Iraqi refugees in the United States and other countries after a failed uprising against Saddam Hussein in 1991. In 1996, about 6,500 Iraqis who had links to an American-sponsored coup attempt against Mr. Hussein were granted asylum.\nThe Bush administration suspended resettlement of Iraqi refugees after the Sept. 11 attacks, and it did not resume until April 2005, after the process had begun for other Arab countries. A total of 198 Iraqis were resettled in the United States as refugees in the fiscal year of 2005, and 202 in 2006, but most were in the pipeline before the 2003 invasion, and few of the cases address the increasingly dire situation for Iraqis today.\nIraqis who work with the military often have to live separately from their families, to avoid putting them in danger. One 25-year-old interpreter left home when his parents in Mosul, in northern Iraq, learned of his work. Now in Baghdad, he has been back home rarely.\nLaith lives with an aunt, away from his wife, in an area where no one knows him. After a visit to his parents several months ago, a stranger asked about his 8-year-old brother at a boys' school. The family fears that it was the early stages of a kidnapping.\n''I bring a lot of troubles when I go to visit my family,'' he said, smoking a cigarette.\nCongress approved one program last year to help get special immigrant status for Iraqi interpreters who have worked for the United Statesmilitary. Laith has tried to apply. The law, which also applies to Afghan interpreters, is capped at 50 a year. Laith was told he needed a senior officer to vouch for him, but he has not worked with one recently, and the one he had worked with is now back in the United States.\nGetting such letters, Laith said, has become increasing difficult, because the interpreters for the most senior American officers now tend to be Arabic speakers hired from the United States, not from Iraq.\nThe State Department has made it clear that it is deeply concerned about the fate of Iraq's religious minorities, including Christians. Officials at the department say that any refugee program must also be geared to those vulnerable groups.\nAs many as 100,000 exiled Iraqi Christians have relatives in the United States and would want to resettle there if given the chance, said Joseph T. Kassab, the executive director of the Chaldean Federation of America, a Michigan-based umbrella group that represents Iraqi Christians. Mr. Kassab said his group's estimates were based on questionnaires devised by University of Michigan professors and filled out by several thousand Iraqi Christian refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon in recent months.\nState Department officials and some advocates for refugees agree that the United States is not likely to begin resettling large numbers of Iraqis anytime soon. New counterterrorism laws after Sept. 11 have slowed immigration, particularly from countries in the Middle East, and Iraqi applications would be bogged down by those security issues.\nA State Department refugee official said that any American resettlement effort would deal with only a small part of the overall refugee problem in the region.\nMs. Limón agreed, saying, ''We'll have trouble with the few thousand who work in the Green Zone.''\nA quicker way to help would be to increase financing to countries that are accepting Iraqis -- Jordan, Syria and Lebanon -- and press those governments to improve their treatment of Iraqis by allowing them to work and travel, officials and advocates said.\nThat would be a real service for Iraqis in Jordan, who speak of rude and sometimes abusive treatment. Jordanians often do not allow Iraqis to bring in suitcases, travelers said, and have been known to turn away young men, forcing families to continue on without them.\n''Put yourself in my shoes,'' said an Iraqi working in an American Army base who spent eight hours in the January cold last year with his wife and infant at the Jordanian border. ''You take your family to another country and they interview you like you are a terrorist.''\nA residency permit is required, and Iraqis must deposit 50,000 Jordanian dinars -- about $70,000 -- in a bank without drawing on it for a year to obtain one. The worker, who wanted to be identified only as Abu Hussein, eventually moved his family back to Iraq, to the south, because he could not afford to stay in Jordan.\n''The Americans are in control of this country,'' he said, talking about Jordan. ''Why don't they become angry at how they are treating us?''\nAbu Hussein is lucky: He lives on the Army base where he works. Laith does not have that luxury. He pays $400 to two guards and a driver to bring him to Baghdad from an American base near Beiji. Insurgents pay taxi drivers near the base to call them when they see a single man with a large overnight bag, he said. Once a cab driver recognized his face.\n''I worked for three years, I lost a lot of things,'' he said, his voice urgent. ''It's supposed to be some respect for me.''\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ

1815956	THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: A YEAR AT WAR -- Evolving Strategies; Chaos Overran Iraq Plan in '06, Bush Team Says	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E2DF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	President Bush began 2006 assuring the country that he had a ''strategy for victory in Iraq.'' He ended the year closeted with his war cabinet on his ranch trying to devise a new strategy, because the existing one had collapsed.\nThe original plan, championed by Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top commander in Baghdad, and backed by Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the defense secretary, called for turning over responsibility for security to the Iraqis, shrinking the number of American bases and beginning the gradual withdrawal of American troops. But the plan collided with Iraq's ferocious unraveling, which took most of Mr. Bush's war council by surprise.\nIn interviews in Washington and Baghdad, senior officials said the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department had also failed to take seriously warnings, including some from its own ambassador in Baghdad, that sectarian violence could rip the country apart and turn Mr. Bush's promise to ''clear, hold and build'' Iraqi neighborhoods and towns into an empty slogan.\nThis left the president and his advisers constantly lagging a step or two behind events on the ground.\n''We could not clear and hold,'' Stephen J. Hadley, the president's national security adviser, acknowledged in a recent interview, in a frank admission of how American strategy had crumbled. ''Iraqi forces were not able to hold neighborhoods, and the effort to build did not show up. The sectarian violence continued to mount, so we did not make the progress on security we had hoped. We did not bring the moderate Sunnis off the fence, as we had hoped. The Shia lost patience, and began to see the militias as their protectors.''\nOver the past 12 months, as optimism collided with reality, Mr. Bush increasingly found himself uneasy with General Casey's strategy. And now, as the image of Saddam Hussein at the gallows recedes, Mr. Bush seems all but certain not only to reverse the strategy that General Casey championed, but also to accelerate the general's departure from Iraq, according to senior military officials.\nGeneral Casey repeatedly argued that his plan offered the best prospect for reducing the perception that the United States remained an occupier -- and it was a path he thought matched Mr. Bush's wishes. Earlier in the year, it had.\nBut as Baghdad spun further out of control, some of the president's advisers now say, Mr. Bush grew concerned that General Casey, among others, had become more fixated on withdrawal than victory.\nNow, having ousted Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Bush sees a chance to bring in a new commander as he announces a new strategy, senior military officials say. General Casey was scheduled to shift out of Iraq in the summer. But now it appears that it may happen in February or March.\nBy mid-September, Mr. Bush was disappointed with the results in Iraq and signed off on a complete review of Iraq strategy -- a review centered in Washington, not in Baghdad. Whatever form the new strategy takes, it seems almost certain to include a ''surge'' in forces, something that General Casey insisted earlier this year he did not need and which might even be counterproductive.\nIn a telephone interview on Friday, General Casey continued to caution against a lengthy expansion in the American military role. ''The longer we in the U.S. forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militias,'' he said. ''And the other thing is that they can continue to blame us for all of Iraq's problems, which are at base their problems.''\nYet if Mr. Bush does send in more American forces, historians may well ask why it took him so long. Some Bush officials argue that the administration erred by refusing to send in a bigger force in 2003, or by sufficiently bolstering it when the insurgency began to take hold.\nThis year, decisions on a new strategy were clearly slowed by political calculations. Many of Mr. Bush's advisers say their timetable for completing an Iraq review had been based in part on a judgment that for Mr. Bush to have voiced doubts about his strategy before the midterm elections in November would have been politically catastrophic.\nMr. Bush came to worry that it was not just his critics and Democrats in Congress who were looking for what he dismissed last month as a strategy of ''graceful exit.'' Visiting the Pentagon a few weeks ago for a classified briefing on Iraq with his generals, Mr. Bush made it clear that he was not interested in any ideas that would simply allow American forces to stabilize the violence. Gen. James T. Conway, the Marine commandant, later told marines about the president's message.\n''What I want to hear from you is how we're going to win,'' he quoted the president as warning his commanders, ''not how we're going to leave.''\nSectarian Killings Escalate\nWhen 2006 began, the United States military did not have a systematic means of tabulating sectarian attacks in Iraq. The Sunni-led insurgency was the focus of Mr. Bush's statements, and its destruction the focus of American military strategy.\nThe Bush administration was jolted on Feb. 22 when Al Qaeda blew up the Askariya Mosque in Samarra, a carefully plotted effort to fan sectarian passions, prompt Shiite retaliation and make Iraq ungovernable.\nThe day of the explosion, Shiites in Sadr City poured into the streets carrying banners and flags. Men, some dressed in black, the traditional dress for the Shiite militia in the area, piled into open back trucks, carrying weapons and shouting slogans of loyalty to Shiite saints. In Baghdad, Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador to Iraq, went to Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari to insist that the Iraqi government impose a 24-hour nationwide curfew. Mr. Jaafari, a member of the Shiite Dawa Party, was not persuaded.\n''You've been here six months, and all of a sudden you know my country better than I do,'' Mr. Jaafari replied, according to an official who witnessed the exchange. But even some Iraqi leaders, including the current national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, echoed Mr. Khalilzad's advice. ''I remember saying to him: 'this is going to be the trigger of an all-out civil war,' '' Mr. Rubaie said.\nMr. Jaafari insisted that he had a plan, which involved closing the Sunni television stations in the country, though as the violence grew he belatedly imposed a curfew that evening. It was the beginning of a debilitating pattern. The Shiite-dominated government did too little to protect Sunni citizens. Shiite militias took matters into their own hands. And the American military struggled to hold the city together with overstretched units.\nIt was clear that the retaliation was highly organized. Sunnis in the eastern portion of Baghdad, in an area called Rusafa, reported that Shiites in SUV's were pulling up, knocking on doors, and seeking specific people. Bodies surfaced in sewers and garbage heaps days later.\nWhen the killing abated, President Bush and his top aides declared that the worst had passed. Both Sunnis and Shiites had ''looked into the abyss and did not like what they saw,'' the president said.\nRenegade militias were a concern but ''not a major long-term problem as long as the Iraqi armed forces and the Iraqi police continue to be loyal to the central government, as they have been,'' Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a March 5 appearance on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.''\nSectarian-inspired executions, however, rose from almost 200 in January to more than 700 in March, and continued upward, according to the Pentagon.\nEven as the violence grew, General Casey, the top American commander in Iraq, appeared confident. He had served as a senior aide for the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, where he gained the confidence of Mr. Rumsfeld before being sent to Baghdad in 2004. At 58, the four-star general reported directly to the defense secretary.\nMr. Rumsfeld had mused publicly that history showed that it could take a decade or so to defeat an insurgency. He was eager to turn over responsibility for the war to the Iraqis and to reduce the American footprint in Iraq as quickly as possible.\nGeneral Casey and Gen. John P. Abizaid, head of the United States Central Command, appeared to be like-minded. During the summer of 2005, General Casey had forecast ''fairly significant reductions'' in American troops by the summer of 2006, an assessment that the commander said reflected ''feelers'' from Sunni insurgents that they might be willing to negotiate and lay down their arms.\nSome of General Casey's aides have said that in developing troop withdrawal plans they were cognizant that the Bush administration had not taken any steps to expand the American military presence despite a persistent insurgency, and seemed to have little appetite for substantially expanding the war effort.\nNo Wish to Stay Indefinitely\nFor his part, General Casey said that his plan was aimed at showing Iraqis that the United States did not want to perpetuate its role as an occupier indefinitely, and stressed that he was following a strategy to match the ''convoluted'' political and military situation in Iraq, and not seeking to advance his career with plans that suited the Bush administration's political agenda.\n''I have worked very hard to ask for what I need, for what I thought I needed to accomplish the mission,'' he said Friday. ''It's always been my view that a heavy and sustained American military presence was not going to solve the problems in Iraq over the long term.''\nBy late 2005, the White House accepted the main tenets of the hand-over strategy. ''Casey and Abizaid had what seemed like a plausible plan at the time,'' Mr. Hadley recalled. ''It was well thought out, and after the elections in January looked like the direction we were headed in.''\nPresident Bush promoted the strategy in a speech to cheering midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., on Nov. 30, 2005: ''We will continue to shift from providing security and conducting operations against the enemy nationwide to conducting more specialized operations targeted at the most dangerous terrorists. We will increasingly move out of Iraqi cities, reduce the number of bases from which we operate, and conduct fewer patrols and convoys.''\nYet not everybody at the Pentagon shared General's Casey's confidence. The Defense Intelligence Agency had briefed the White House in early 2006 that the insurgency was winning in Iraq, according to a former military officer. The briefing, which chronicled the steady rise in the number of attacks, prompted a counter-briefing from General Casey's intelligence chief, who prepared an analysis tracing the positive trends in Iraq.\nData gathered by General Casey's own command, which showed a steady increase in weekly attacks and civilian casualties, lent support to the Defense Intelligence Agency assessment.\nAt the State Department, skepticism about General Casey's strategy ran deep. Philip D. Zelikow, the counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice until he resigned in December, went to Iraq in late 2005, and returned with a recommendation that the first part of 2006 be devoted to a big push -- military, economic and political -- to boost the soon-to-be-formed Iraqi government. His approach contradicted the commitment to reductions.\nStill, the general was reluctant to abandon his basic strategy. According to a senior administration official, General Casey told the White House in April, May and June of 2006 that the American military was having success against Al Qaeda of Mesopotamia and the Sunni-based insurgency, and that sectarian violence could be managed.\nCalls for a Review of Strategy\nBy May 2006, uneasy officials at the State Department and the National Security Council argued for a review of Iraq strategy. A meeting was convened at Camp David to consider those approaches, according to participants in the session, but Mr. Bush left early for a secret visit to Baghdad, where he reviewed the war plans with General Casey and Mr. Maliki, and met with the American pilot whose plane's missiles killed Iraq's Al Qaeda leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He returned to Washington in a buoyant mood.\nThe visit meant that the reconsideration of strategy was not as thorough as some officials hoped.\nLater in June, General Casey flew to Washington to give briefings on the latest version of his troop reduction plan at the Pentagon and White House. The number of American combat brigades, which then totaled 14, would be reduced by two in September and might shrink to 10 by December, if conditions allowed. If the Iraqis continued to assume more responsibility for their security, there would be only five or six combat brigades in Iraq by December 2007.\nYet already President Bush was signaling to top aides that he wanted to re-evaluate how to keep stability before proceeding with troop withdrawals. His caution matched a growing unease among American field commanders in Iraq, and officers on the streets of Baghdad, who said they were surprised by General Casey's continued advocacy of withdrawals and consolidating bases. They said that American forces should be focusing on a greater counterinsurgency effort, which would require that a substantial number of troops be dispersed to protect that population against insurgent and militia attacks.\nEvents overtook the White House. In early August, the United States was forced to reverse course and add troops in Baghdad. On reflection, Mr. Hadley said, ''Finally the patience of the Shia had worn thin,'' and, ''By the time the unity government took over the cycle of sectarian violence had begun. And they and we have not been able to get ahead of it .''\nThe administration's summer strategy seemed simple: American and Iraqi forces would clear selected neighborhoods of insurgents and militia leaders, hold them with the Iraqi police, and win over the population with job-creating reconstruction programs.\nBut carrying out the strategy proved maddeningly difficult. The American troop commitment was modest at best. With the addition of roughly 7,000 troops the American military force assigned to carry out the operation in Baghdad was brought to some 15,000. (During one discussion of the operation in August, President Bush asked General Casey whether he had sufficient troops to secure Baghdad; the general assured him that he did.)\nThe Iraqis never delivered four of the six Iraqi Army battalions that they had committed to the effort. Some of the Iraqi police units proved to be so infiltrated by Shiite militias that they had to be pulled off duty for retraining.\nWeaknesses in the Iraqi Forces\nIn the Sunni stronghold of Dora, in southwestern Baghdad, American troops were forced to clear thousands of homes twice: the Iraqi security forces who moved in behind them were too few, and too little dedicated to the task, to keep the insurgents from returning.\nIn neighborhoods like Baya, the Shiite-dominated Iraqi National Police set up menacing checkpoints on the routes Sunnis used to seek medical attention or buy fuel.\n''They were trying to dominate the Sunni population and terrorize them to the point that they would leave Baghdad or leave the neighborhood,'' recalled Lt. Col. James Danna, who had led the Second Battalion, Sixth Infantry Regiment, which oversaw those areas. He said that like the first Baghdad security operation, the second also failed. As the American elections approached, White House officials say, they believed it would amount to political suicide to announce a broad reassessment of Iraq strategy. But they recognized that unless they began such a review, they would be forced to accept the conclusions of the final report of the Iraq Study Group -- headed by James A. Baker III, the former Republican secretary of state, and Lee H. Hamilton, the former Democratic congressman.\nThe effort started in September, around the time Mr. Bush decided to oust Mr. Rumsfeld. In the days before the election, Mr. Bush suggested during an interview that Mr. Rumsfeld could stay until the end of his term -- a deliberately misleading statement that Mr. Bush said later was necessitated by the political season. Similarly, it was days after the election that the White House revealed that a major Iraq review was under way.\nIn public, Mr. Bush continues to insist that he and Mr. Maliki share the same vision. In private, one of his former aides said, ''he questions whether Maliki has the will or the power'' to make good on any commitments.\nAmerican military officers have also wondered if the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government and the Americans share the same vision. Were the Iraqis not pulling their weight because they did not have the capability to provide security and proceed with reconstruction? Or did the Iraqi authorities have a sectarian agenda?\nAs security efforts in Baghdad faltered, a confidential briefing on possible ''end states'' in Iraq was prepared by officials under the command of Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarielli, who until a few weeks ago led the day-to-day operations in Iraq. It suggested the dark vision of a divided nation that haunts the administration.\nUnless the United States persuaded the Iraqi government to change course, those who prepared the briefing foresaw an Iraq run by a relatively weak central government, which would include a largely autonomous nine-province Shiite region in the south and a Shiite-dominated Baghdad. The Kurds would retain their autonomy in the north. The Sunnis would essentially be relegated to the western Anbar Province and other enclaves.\nThe briefing posed a question: was this an outcome the United States could live with? If so, what could the United States do to minimize the bloodshed? If not, what should be done to alter this course?\nMr. Bush still insists on talking about victory, even if his own advisers differ about how to define it. ''It's a word the American people understand,'' he told members of the Iraq Study Group who came to see him at the White House in November, according to two commission members who attended. ''And if I start to change it, it will look like I'm beginning to change my policy.''

Pataki holds little love for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and has only a bit more for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican. Still, before Gov. Eliot Spitzer's address, the three men shook hands, smiled, and sat together for what could be the last time. (Mr. Pataki's wife, Libby, was artfully placed between Mr. Pataki and the two other men.)\nMr. Silver and Mr. Bruno, meanwhile, kibitzed through the ceremonial introductions like two grizzled veterans from an era that the new whippersnapper, Mr. Spitzer, would like to retire.\nDuring his speech, Mr. Spitzer sent an olive branch to the Legislature's two leaders by referring to them -- ''my good friend Shelly Silver, and Joe Bruno'' -- somewhat surprising words from a man who has vowed to reform the ''three men in a room'' style of governing that Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno represent.\nBut Mr. Silver has been Mr. Spitzer's ally and occasional foil on some issues, while Mr. Bruno has said he would work well with the new governor, but Mr. Bruno also faces an uncertain future, now that he is under investigation for his outside consulting work.\nAnd as far as Mr. Pataki is concerned? Mr. Spitzer thanked the departing governor for his ''careful stewardship'' of the state for the last 12 years, a compliment that had a robotic quality.

The Auburn Tigers were still living in the present and believed they needed to define this season once and for all.\nRanked as high as No. 2 in October, Auburn became the team with its face mask pressed against the Bowl Championship Series window after losses to Arkansas and Georgia derailed its national title and Southeastern Conference championship hopes.\nThe 10th-ranked Tigers gained a sense of completion Monday with a 17-14 victory against No. 22 Nebraska in a Cotton Bowl game that itself has been searching for an identity and looking to regain a lost luster.\nAuburn's absence of style points was symbolic of its season. The Tigers were manhandled for much of the first half, but they went into halftime with the score tied at 14-14. Linebacker Karibi Dede's 52-yard interception return and safety Tristan Davis's fumble recovery on a botched fake punt by Nebraska led to quick touchdowns, a 9-yard pass from Brandon Cox to Carl Stewart and Stewart's 1-yard run.\nAfter John Vaughn kicked a 42-yard field goal with 6 minutes 20 seconds left in the third quarter to give Auburn a 3-point lead, the Tigers held firm to finish 11-2 and probably secure a top-10 final ranking.\nNebraska, playing in its biggest bowl since the 2002 Rose Bowl, fell to 9-5.\n''It was a typical Auburn win -- win ugly,'' Coach Tommy Tuberville said. ''We were lucky to be in the game after the first half.''\nOnce among the bowl elite, the Cotton Bowl has clung to its Jan. 1 date but has dropped in status with the rise of the B.C.S. formulas and big-money matchups.\nEven two programs with reputations for drawing big fan contingents to road games could not guarantee a full stadium here. The announced attendance was 66,777, about 1,500 shy of a sellout and the lowest since 63,465 attended the 2001 game between Kansas State and Tennessee. The Cotton Bowl seats 72,262, but officials cut short ticket sales by not opening four auxiliary bleacher sections (about 4,000 more seats).\nJudging by numerous patches of empty seats, several thousand tickets appeared to go unused, although Auburn and Nebraska said they sold their allotments of 12,500 tickets.\n''We are what we are,'' said Bruce Gadd, the chairman of the board for the Cotton Bowl Athletic Association, adding he was somewhat disappointed the universities did not ask for more tickets.\n''We're not a B.C.S. bowl. I can see how some folks would not want to travel down here.''\nHe added: ''But it's about a lot of things other than just the number of people we have here. We're happy with the numbers.''\nGadd said the Cotton Bowl wanted to crack the B.C.S. lineup, but that will probably have to wait until the current agreements expire after the 2010 season.\n''I venture to guess we'll be back in the mix, whatever they're going to call the next revolution of postseason college football,'' Gadd said. ''I predict we'll be there. A couple years ago, I might not have said that because we were struggling. But we're headed in that direction.''\nNebraska fans clearly outnumbered the Auburn crowd. The Cornhuskers fan Dave Bagenhost said more Nebraska fans would have come except for the 40-degree weather and the 10:30 a.m. local kickoff time.\nBagenhost said that when Nebraska fans went to a bowl, ''they want the warm weather.''\n''Dallas really doesn't have that to offer,'' he said.\nGeorge Castelman, a Dallas resident and ticket entrepreneur, has tried to sell tickets at three bowl games recently, and supply has exceeded demand each time.\nAt the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio, he said, tickets with a $65 face value were fetching $20 for the game last Saturday between Texas and Iowa. He received only about $10 for tickets priced at $35 for the Independence Bowl, which pitted Alabama against Oklahoma State last Thursday in Shreveport, La.\nOn Monday morning, Castelman stood at the entrance to the State Fair of Texas parking lot adjacent to the Cotton Bowl and tried to sell tickets with a $90 face value for $30 to $50.\n''It's the economy right now,'' Castelman said. ''People don't have money. People are tightening. Of course, you're going to get a segment of people that will always pay $200 for a 50-yard-line seat. But that's far in between. But the overall populace that attends these games, they can't afford to go.''\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL
1815960	Q & A	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E1DF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Sleeping Vines\nQ. Do plants sleep?\nA. Plants do not sleep in the sense of daily passing into a state of reduced consciousness, but many species exhibit sleeplike states, like the dormancy of winter or the overnight shutdown of photosynthesis in the absence of sunlight. As in the human body, hormones come into play to regulate the timing of the cyclical physical changes that occur.\nOne well-known and well-studied sleeplike state is called nyctinasty, or night movement. This occurs in the many plants that fold or shift their leaves or petals on a daily schedule, including beans, morning glories and four o'clocks.\nDarwin studied nyctinasty and hypothesized that it might protect against lower nighttime temperatures.\nOther scientists suggest that in rainforest plants, nyctinasty allows for maximum daytime sun exposure while folding sheds excess water at night.\nSuch movement takes place on a 24-hour cycle, which can continue even when the plant is cut off from light. The plants' internal chemical signals, which vary by species, keep the system running on its own, though it gradually loses synchronization with light stimuli.\nC. CLAIBORNE RAY
1815961	OBSERVATORY	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E1DF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Fish and Eel Team\nIt's rare for two species to help each other while hunting, and it's easy to understand why. Cooperation during the hunt would turn to competition with disputes over the spoils. (Humans and dogs are one species pair that do work together, but there is no dispute over who gets what.)\nNow, cooperative hunting has been found for the first time among two species of fish. Redouan Bshary of the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland and colleagues observed coordinated behavior among groupers and giant moray eels around coral reefs in the Red Sea.\nThe two are made for each other. Both eat small reef fish, but they hang out in different places: groupers in open water just off a reef, morays in reef nooks and crannies. If a reef fish encounters a moray, it may swim into open water and encounter a grouper. On the other hand, a fish hoping to escape a grouper by swimming into the reef may encounter a moray.\nAs described in the online journal PLoS Biology, the researchers observed groupers and morays together more often than would be expected by random chance. Occasionally, a grouper would swim past a moray and vigorously shake its head. (A video is at nytimes.com/science.) That, presumably, was a signal to cooperate: the two fish would then swim together, for up to 44 minutes.\nThe groupers captured more prey in a given amount of time when hunting with morays than without. Morays, too, were successful in the hunt. Both groupers and morays immediately swallowed their prey whole, and the researchers suggested this may be one reason that their cooperative behavior is successful: there is never a carcass to fight over.\nSauropod Mystery Stones\nThe sauropod dinosaurs were the largest land creatures ever, with some specimens tipping the scales at up to 60,000 pounds.\nThey were vegetarians, however, and scientists have long wondered how they could have eaten enough to grow so big. They had small heads and pointy teeth, ill-suited to mashing up the large quantities of vegetation needed. So some scientists have suggested that the dinosaurs must have swallowed stones and used them to grind up the food, much the way modern birds do in their gizzards. Such stones, or gastroliths, have been found in fossil sauropods.\nBut a new study by Oliver Wings and P. Martin Sander of the University of Bonn in Germany makes the case that these fossil gastroliths were not part of any dinosaur food mill.\nIn the study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, the researchers conducted experiments with ostriches. Though an ostrich is no dinosaur, birds may be the dinosaurs' closest living relatives. And the ostrich, as the largest plant-eating bird, has a well-developed food mill in its gizzard.\nThe researchers allowed the ostriches to swallow stones of different types, and measured how much the stones changed over time. They found that the stones were rapidly abraded, and thus retained a dull appearance. Dinosaur gastroliths, by contrast, are highly polished, indicating much slower abrasion.\nIn ostriches, gastroliths account for about 1 percent of body weight. In the few sauropod fossils with gastroliths, the figure is less than 0.1 percent, which means there would not have been enough of the stones to do much grinding.\nThe researchers suggested that the sauropods swallowed stones by accident, or for their mineral content. And they say the dinosaurs may have extracted maximum nutrients from food by retaining the stones for a long time, which their large size would have enabled.\nPlanet Scope\nThe search for planets outside the solar system got a boost last week with the successful launching of a French satellite from Kazakhstan.\nThe satellite, called Corot, carries a small telescope designed to detect the slight changes in starlight caused by the passage of a planet. The hope is that it will find smaller Earth-like planets; almost all of the extrasolar planets discovered so far have been gaseous giants.\nSquirrels That Predict the Future\nIt's like the Beach Boys said: Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world.\nFor red squirrels in the Canadian Yukon and Europe, the wave in question is an overabundance of seed cones from spruce trees. Researchers report that the squirrels are able to predict when the trees will provide such copious amounts of food, and produce two consecutive litters just at the right time to take advantage of it.\nMany trees produce relatively little seed in most years, which helps keep the populations of seed-consuming animals down. In certain years, the trees produce large amounts of seed, an event known as masting. With the seed eaters' numbers reduced, having so much seed ensures that more of it will not be eaten and will have the chance to grow.\nIt's a ''swamp and starve'' strategy, said Stan Boutin of the University of Alberta, lead author of a study on the squirrels in the journal Science. Most years, the trees starve the animals, and then they swamp them with food. ''The predators don't have time to respond,'' he said.\nBut the squirrels are different, said Dr. Boutin, who has studied them in the Yukon for two decades. They know in advance when a mast year will occur, and after they have a first litter, the mothers interrupt their weaning and conceive a second one. ''The squirrels time it so they have the maximum number of members in the population right when they can take advantage of that seed,'' Dr. Boutin said.\nHaving an abundance of seed cones is critical for the young squirrels' survival because it helps them break into a highly territorial system. ''It's such a big win for these females to produce that second litter,'' Dr. Boutin said.\nHow the squirrels know that a masting event is going to occur is a mystery, but Dr. Boutin said they may get cues from buds the trees produce 18 months before. In a masting year, most of the buds will become cones, not new branches. The squirrels may be able to tell visually that the buds will become cones, or they may get chemical cues, in the form of plant hormones, when they eat some.\nDr. Boutin said he and colleagues will study whether this ''anticipatory reproduction'' occurs in other animals. ''It could simply be that researchers have never thought to look because they have thought that this is an impossibility,'' he said.\nObservatory

Would that money benefit society more if invested in our children (18 percent are chronically hungry and have no assured health care; schools have leaky roofs and a chronic shortage of textbooks and qualified teachers)?\nInternationally, I wonder if population-increasing technologies (eradication of diseases, chemical controls for malaria, etc.) in already-overpopulated areas condemn future generations of humans and other species to ever-lower standards of living on an Earth with finite resources. More humans equals exhausted soils, climate-changing resource consumption, and war.\nAn accurate cost-benefit study might be very enlightening. In a world of 6.5 billion humans and rapid climate change, technologies that increase longevity and total populations are certainly ethically questionable, if not clearly immoral.\nKirk S.

1815970	Crash Kills Officer And Two Daughters	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401EFDF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	An off-duty New York City police officer and his two daughters were killed yesterday morning when the sport utility vehicle he was driving veered off Interstate 78 near Bedminster, N.J., in wet conditions and struck a tree, the authorities said.\nThe driver, Louicasse Pierre, 39, of Brooklyn, had worked for the public housing police since he first joined the force in 2003. Mr. Pierre and his elder daughter, Ashley, 9, were pronounced dead at the scene.\nHis other daughter, Arabellah, 4, was taken to Morristown Memorial Hospital, where she died a short time later.\nThe accident happened about 7:45 a.m. just west of the exit for Interstate 287, said Sgt. Jeanne Hengemuhle of the New Jersey State Police.\nThe S.U.V., a Toyota 4Runner, was westbound on I-78 when it went off the road into a wooded area, Sergeant Hengemuhle said. It traveled about 200 feet before hitting a tree head on, she said.\nThe cause of the accident was under investigation, though alcohol did not appear to have played a role, Sergeant Hengemuhle said.
1815971	10 Years Later, Nolan Has Fans	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02EFDF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Draped over the lower bowl at HSBC Arena on Monday was a sign that reminded anyone who might have forgotten: ''Welcome Back Ted Nolan.''\nNolan, the coach of the Islanders, was the Buffalo Sabres' coach for two seasons 10 years ago. Beloved during his time in Buffalo, he left the team amid controversy, rejecting a one-year contract extension and spending the next nine years in exile from N.H.L. coaching before the Islanders hired him in June.\nMonday's game was Nolan's first back in Buffalo as an N.H.L. head coach, but the Sabres, who have the best record in the Eastern Conference, ruined his homecoming with a 3-1 victory.\nThis was the second meeting between the teams this season. Buffalo won the first, 3-0, at Nassau Coliseum in October to tie an N.H.L. record for most victories to start a season (10). At 29-7-3, the Sabres have the second-best record in the league. The Islanders (19-16-3) remained in third place in the Atlantic Division, a point behind the Rangers and 6 behind the Devils.\nFor Nolan, the trip to Buffalo was a heartwarming reminder of his time as the Sabres' coach. Islanders goalie Rick DiPietro said that fans chanted ''Teddy!'' at the team's hotel downtown on New Year's Eve. And Nolan said people approached him on the street to wish him well.\n''It's always nice to be appreciated for the work that you did here,'' Nolan said.\nFans remembered how he led an overachieving cast of grinders to the Northeast Division title in 1996-97. Afterward, he won the Jack Adams Award as the league's coach of the year, but he was gone before the next season began.\nThe franchise's front office was in turmoil at the time. Rival owners were engaged in a power struggle, and Nolan feuded with General Manager John Muckler and the star goalkeeper Dominik Hasek.\nMuckler was fired after the season, and his replacement, Darcy Regier, offered Nolan a one-year contract extension. Nolan rejected it because he said he deserved a longer commitment. It never came, ending his stint with the Sabres. Angry fans protested downtown.\n''There were ownership issues,'' said Regier, who is still the Sabres' general manager. ''There were a lot of issues. It was a difficult time.''\nRegier said of his contract offer to Nolan: ''It was my determination that we needed to spend a year together and make sure that we were going to be able to work as a team. That was the reason for offering the one year.''\nNolan left, and Regier hired Lindy Ruff as his replacement. Now in his 10th season, Ruff has the longest tenure among current N.H.L. head coaches. He has guided the Sabres to 334 regular-season victories and to the Stanley Cup finals in the 1998-99, when Buffalo lost in six games to the Dallas Stars.\nAfter last season, when he led Buffalo to the Eastern Conference finals, Ruff won the Jack Adams Award.\nOf the announced crowd of 18,690 at the game Monday, Ruff was perhaps the only one not in the mood to discuss Nolan's return.\n''We are so far removed from that,'' he said afterward. ''It's 10 years ago. It's a story that half the team doesn't know about.''\nRyan Miller, who finished with 29 saves, shut out the Islanders for nearly two and a half periods before Jason Blake scored 8 minutes 19 seconds into the third. Blake's team-leading 22nd goal narrowed the Islanders' deficit to 2-1. He took a pass from Arron Asham and cut to the net, scoring on a backhand shot.\nAsham had been the Islanders' most dangerous player all game. A rugged right wing, he blasted a slap shot off the crossbar during the first period. Richard Park fired the rebound at a yawning net, but Miller snared the puck in his glove.\n''He definitely stole one for them,'' Asham said. ''I thought we outplayed them for the majority of the game, and he made some big saves.''\nDiPietro was pulled for an extra attacker late in the game, but Jochen Hecht scored the Sabres' final goal with 16 seconds remaining.\nBuffalo's Martin Biron, the backup goalie, is the only Sabres player remaining from Nolan's days as coach. He said he had only fond memories of his time with Nolan.\n''Everybody was on the same page and respected what he was trying to do in the locker room,'' Biron said. ''He was always great to me.''\nHOCKEY
1815972	Moving In, With Big Plans to Remake State Government	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05EEDF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Last month, New York State's top fiscal officer pleaded guilty to defrauding the government and resigned, its Senate majority leader announced that he was being investigated by the F.B.I., and a state senator was charged with diverting state aid from a children's charity to his own private cigar label.\nIf Gov. Eliot Spitzer could already claim a strong mandate for his calls to make significant changes in the culture of Albany, thanks to the record-setting 69 percent of the vote that he won in November, the scandals that engulfed the capital last month while he was waiting in the wings as governor-elect have only strengthened his hand.\nBut it was clear, as Mr. Spitzer delivered his inaugural address on Monday that despite his campaign pledge that ''Day 1, Everything Changes,'' many things in Albany, a famously change-averse place, remain stubbornly the same.\nSitting right in front of Mr. Spitzer, and not always looking very pleased, were two of the three men who have controlled the Capitol during its years of political gridlock: Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno.\nAnd New York is still facing the challenges that have bedeviled its last few governors: a deeply depressed upstate economy, struggling schools and mounting health care costs, some of the highest taxes in the nation, and a state government that has been seemingly unable to tackle many of these problems because of its chronic dysfunction.\nEnter Mr. Spitzer, vowing change and calling his election a mandate.\n''We chose pragmatism and ethics over partisan politics and dysfunction, and we demanded an end to gridlock,'' Mr. Spitzer told the crowd in his inaugural address, winning loud applause from the audience, but stony silence from Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver, who looked on impassively from their seats in the front row on the stage.\nBut the collision of three very different scandals last month, coming just as a reform-minded governor was about to take office, is posing the greatest threat in decades to the culture of a state capital that critics say has increasingly fallen under the spell of lobbyists, campaign donors and lawmakers who put their political survival first.\nMr. Bruno is enmeshed in a widening criminal investigation into his business ties to people seeking state money or actions.\nAn important ally of Mr. Spitzer's, State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, resigned in disgrace after admitting to using a state worker as a personal aide for his wife. And federal prosecutors are showing a newfound zeal for taking on corruption in Albany with the indictment of a state senator for what they called an abuse of a hallowed Albany tradition: pork-barrel spending.\nTaken together, the three scandals make it much harder to argue for maintaining the status quo here. And Mr. Spitzer made it clear in his inaugural that he intends to keep pushing for changes.\n''In order to return to the policies of opportunity and prosperity,'' the new governor said, ''we must change the ethics of Albany and end the politics of cynicism and division in our state.''\nIf history is any guide, Mr. Spitzer will be successful in pushing through some of his reforms and programs, as other governors have been able to seize on crises to enact ambitious changes. And many set the tone at their inaugurations.\nMore than a century ago, Theodore Roosevelt warned when he was inaugurated governor that ''it is absolutely impossible for a republic long to endure if it becomes either corrupt or cowardly.'' He went on to overhaul the civil service laws.\nMore recently, Hugh L. Carey said in his first State of the State address in 1975 that ''the times of plenty, the days of wine and roses, are over'' before shepherding New York City through its fiscal crisis. When Mario M. Cuomo evoked the ''family of New York'' at his inauguration in 1983, he offered a liberal alternative to the conservative ideology of the Reagan era. And George E. Pataki spoke of ''the revolutionary spirit of Saratoga,'' a turning point in the American Revolution, to call for smaller government at his inaugural, before pushing spending and tax cuts through a skeptical Assembly.\nGovernor Spitzer is making the case that the Capitol must clean itself up if it is to successfully address the challenges the state faces in educating its children, providing health care for the uninsured, shoring up the desperate upstate economy and holding on to businesses and residents burdened by some of the highest taxes in the country.\nWith last month's scandals, there have now been at least 10 state lawmakers who have been investigated, indicted or convicted in recent years. Assemblyman Brian M. McLaughlin, a Queens Democrat, was accused last year of illegally obtaining $2.2 million, and even charged with making an aide take his E-ZPass to Albany to make it appear that he had gone to the Capitol so he could bill the state for the daily allowances that lawmakers get when they are in session. And Assemblywoman Diane M. Gordon was overwhelmingly re-elected in November even though she was charged in July with seeking bribes -- in the form of a house -- from a developer seeking city land.\nSome of Mr. Spitzer's proposals -- adding teeth to the state's ethics laws, overhauling its lax campaign finance laws, ending the gerrymandering that has long insulated lawmakers from competitive elections -- will be a tough sell in a Legislature that is all about protecting its incumbents. But the recent spate of bad news out of Albany -- where swapping rumors about subpoenas has supplanted the usual political chitchat -- had been good news for Mr. Spitzer, giving an added sense of urgency to his proposals.\nMr. Spitzer's pitch on Monday was that a more ethical, accountable government would lead to better policies. ''Some public officials may not want to face stricter ethics rules and more competitive elections,'' he said, ''but all citizens will win when we finally get a government that puts the people's interests, openness and integrity first.''\nBruce N. Gyory, a lawyer, lobbyist and student of New York political history who attended the speech, said Mr. Spitzer seemed to be calling for the kind of purposeful reform that will lead to new policies, in the mold of the changes that Alfred E. Smith pushed through as governor.\n''He poured a very good foundation,'' Mr. Gyory said of the speech. ''Now the question becomes: Will he be able to match today's excellent start with the governmental architecture and the political pillars to sustain what he's trying to do?''\nNEWS ANALYSIS
1815973	Boxer, 28, Killed in Hit and Run Savored Hard-Knock Life	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EEDF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	The sites were not glamorous -- a raceway in Yonkers, a union hall in Hauppauge on Long Island, the Emerald Queen Casino in Tacoma, Wash. -- and the pay was not great, either. He earned anywhere from $50 to $12,000 per fight, and sometimes a night at a discount motel and a day's worth of meal vouchers.\nStill, Kemal Kolenovic loved the fighting life unequivocally. At age 28, his record was fairly unremarkable: 10 victories, 6 losses and 2 draws with nine years under his belt as a professional boxer. But even those numbers, if looked at a certain way, owed something to an attitude that valued enthusiasm over rigor and reduced the science of a boxing match to youthful play.\n''He was an all-out brawler, not much of a technical boxer, but he had a blast just throwing punches, and he was good at it,'' said Tony Kalaj, a friend who works for Joe DeGuardia's Star Boxing, a fight promotion company. ''The record? It was hard for him to get fights with his style. He made opponents look stupid.''\nTwo days ago in the Bronx, Mr. Kolenovic was killed after a barroom brawl in which the police said he had not participated. Sometime after 4:30 a.m. on Sunday, he was run over by a man driving a sport utility vehicle. The man was fleeing the Moonlight Restaurant and Bar on Belmont Avenue, where he and others, but not Mr. Kolenovic, had argued over which Albanian surnames were most associated with tougher and generally superior people.\nThe men had taken the fight outside. Mr. Kolenovic, who was at the Moonlight with an uncle, Tony Mujovic, 35, had eventually followed them onto the sidewalk and joined a group that had gathered, perhaps just to see what was going on or perhaps, Mr. Mujovic said, to try to get them to break it up. One of the men climbed into a dark sport utility vehicle and plowed into the crowd. The driver fled, and the police said last night that he was still at large.\nThe S.U.V. hit Mr. Kolenovic and threw him headfirst into a tree. He was pronounced dead shortly afterward at St. Barnabas Hospital.\n''We sat around reviewing what the security camera got,'' said Al Kolenovic, a cousin. ''You see Kemal sitting outside, wanting to leave. The poor guy's got his hands in his pockets, with his back to the car. He didn't know what hit him.''\nYesterday at midday, three or four dozen men who said they were cousins of Mr. Kolenovic gathered in Astoria, Queens, at the Islamic Unity and Culture Center of Plav-Gusinje, a Muslim mosque that serves the city's Montenegrin community.\nAbout half of them sat around folding tables in the basement; the rest spilled outside, onto the corner of 12th Street and 31st Avenue. They were long-faced and mostly with dark hair, and a good number of them smoked cigarettes in the rain. The women in their lives -- sisters, spouses, mothers -- were inside, upstairs with scarves over their heads, kneeling in front of prayer mats.\n''Right now, it's the women's turn,'' Al Kolenovic said. ''And then the men again. Both groups do it five times a day until the deceased has his burial. Pretty sad story.''\nHe said the burial was to take place today at a Balkan cemetery in Monticello, N.Y., pending the approval of the boxer's mother, Sanija Kolenovic. She flew from her home in Germany and was due to arrive at the mosque at any minute.\nSeveral friends from the boxing community had been by to pay their respects, including Elvir Muriqi, an Albanian whose boxing nickname is the Kosovo Kid. Joe Antonacci, a ring announcer, described Mr. Kolenovic as ''a beautiful person in a brutal, lonely, thankless game.''\n''He had such charisma in the ring,'' Mr. Antonacci went on. ''He looked like Brian Setzer from the Stray Cats -- that blond hair combed back. He had a big Albanian following, obviously. But he couldn't go into an arena and not make fans. He was a nonstop movement fighter, fast hands, lots of spirit.''\nMr. Kolenovic fought as a welterweight. He was 5-foot-7 and weighed about 150 pounds. He came to Brooklyn from Montenegro in 1993, when he was 14 or 15, without his parents. He worked construction and washed dishes in restaurants to pay rent. He lived in Midwood.\nMr. Kolenovic worked with a few trainers in his career. The last was Chelo Betancourt, who worked with him at Gleason's Gym in Dumbo.\n''He was such a tough kid, a lot of championship fighters liked to spar with him because he could take it and he could adjust his style to match any fighter,'' Mr. Betancourt said. ''Antonio Diaz brought him out to Texas when he was training for a title fight, paid him $150 a day to stay out there and spar for a few weeks.''\nIn 2003, Mr. Kolenovic beat Fontaine Cabell for the New York State welterweight title. ''The promoters were looking for a walkover opponent, but we prepared good,'' Mr. Betancourt said. He said that Mr. Kolenovic won by technical knockout ''by counterpunching the whole way,'' and that ''he shocked everybody.''\nThe following year, Mr. Kolenovic lost his title defense, also by technical knockout. Mr. Betancourt said that he was underprepared because he had been spending more time drinking with friends than in the gym, and that he had advised him not to take the fight when he did.\nAt times, said Mr. Kalaj, the promoter: ''They threw him in with the wolves. He got robbed a lot by hometown referees.''\nAround 3 p.m. yesterday, the car driving Mr. Kolenovic's mother pulled up at the mosque. She sobbed as she was escorted inside and up the stairs. When she approached her son's body in the open coffin, she clutched her head, dropped to her knees, and screamed.\nAll the men upstairs stood at the side of the room, while the women surrounded Mr. Kolenovic's body, also crying. Mrs. Kolenovic, who cried the loudest, took her son's face in her hands and held it.
1815974	In East Village, No End Is Seen In 8-Year War Over a Building	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507EEDF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Public School 64, a vacant building with a leaky roof, broken windows and a colony of pigeons, sits on East Ninth Street near Tompkins Square Park at the center of one of the last fights against gentrification in Manhattan.\nSince 1998, it has touched off pitched battles in the neighborhood, embroiling two mayoral administrations and employing a legion of lawyers and fixers, all for naught. In November, vandals broke in and painted the walls with another layer of anti-landlord graffiti.\nGregg Singer, the small-time developer who bought the building, which runs from Ninth Street to 10th Street, for $3.15 million at a city auction, says he has been stymied at every turn from renovating the building for elderly tenants, nonprofit organizations or college dormitories. He said he was the victim of a political deal between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and a former city councilwoman, Margarita López.\nMr. Singer's opponents view him as an interloper with little respect for the needs of the community or the building's history as a political and cultural center for the East Village and Lower East Side. They say his secret intention is to build luxury housing.\nThe opponents include not only neighborhood activists but nearly every local elected official, the pro-development Bloomberg administration and the owner of the penthouse next door at the Christadora House, a 1980s symbol of encroaching gentrification where protesters once chanted, ''Kill yuppie scum.'' The 16-story, 79-year-old apartment building originally housed a charity by the same name that helped immigrants adjust to life in New York.\nMore than eight years after Mr. Singer bought the building, there is no end in sight. P.S. 64 is a blight even as Tompkins Square Park, the site of a homeless encampment and riot in 1988, has been transformed into a quiet oasis for the white-collar professionals who live nearby.\n''It's an amazing tale,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''Whatever you believe, the fact that this has dragged on so long is amazing. The property continues to be an eyesore and a wasted opportunity in the neighborhood.''\nMr. Singer has filed three lawsuits against the city, including one (filed by Randy M. Mastro, a deputy mayor under Rudolph W. Giuliani) that seeks $100 million in damages, claiming Mr. Bloomberg ''cut a dirty political deal with the local city councilwoman at the time, Margarita López: In exchange for her support of his re-election bid, he would see to it that his administration blocked the owner's development plans.''\nLast year, the city declared the building a landmark, an example of the French Renaissance Revival style. It now plans to change the zoning to eliminate most development options.\n''For the government to sell me the building and then landmark it, it's like bait and switch,'' Mr. Singer said. ''Complaints from the community don't bother me. It's the government that's the problem. They've blocked me from doing any useful development here.''\nCity officials called his claims nonsense and have asked that the suit be dismissed. Virginia Waters, a city lawyer, said that Mr. Singer could use the building for a medical or community center, or a dormitory, so long as the city is assured it would be occupied by students.\n''The city has in no way prohibited those uses from going forward,'' she said. ''However, we have read that he wants an exorbitant rent. That may be his problem.''\nMs. López, who was appointed last April to the city's Housing Authority by Mr. Bloomberg, did not return calls about the controversy.\nThe atmosphere is poisonous. One flier likened Mr. Singer's dormitory design to a Nazi concentration camp; another invited people to toss dog droppings over the construction fence.\nMore recently, Mr. Singer put up his own posters announcing that the ''Christotora Treatment Center,'' for the homeless, drug addicted and recently paroled, was ''coming soon.'' And he set off a furor when he used an old permit to alter the outside of the building to buttress his suit challenging landmark designation.\n''Singer's been combative from the beginning,'' said David McWater, the chairman of Community Board 3, which includes Ninth Street. ''He thinks it's his God-given right to make as much money as he can.''\nThere was little question that Mr. Singer had stepped onto a minefield when he outbid a dozen rival bidders in July 1998 at an city auction. Police officers offered to escort him past an angry group of protesters.\nIt took a year to close on the property, which Mr. Singer says is now worth $51 million, though the effect of landmark status is unclear. The building came with a deed restriction: It must be used as a ''community facility,'' including a library, nursing home or clinic, or for social service or arts groups.\nThe original opposition to the sale was led by Armando Perez and Chino Garcia of Charas, a community group that established the El Bohio Cultural and Community Center in the building after P.S. 64 closed in 1977. Over time, it became a home for housing activists, artists, theater groups, a bicycle repair shop and the Latin Kings, a notorious street gang.\nThe school is ''symbolic of the struggle in our community,'' said Councilwoman Rosie Mendez, Ms. López's successor. ''When everyone else fled the community during the 1970s, we took out the rubble and created community gardens, affordable housing. He can move forward on developing this as a community facility, or he can decide to sell it.''\nIn 1997, Antonio Pagán, who had clashed with Charas and who was then the local city councilman, urged the Giuliani administration to auction the property. The fight to ''save'' P.S. 64 became a cause célèbre among local groups, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, the actress Susan Sarandon and Ms. López, a friend of Mr. Perez's who later succeeded Mr. Pagán on the Council.\nMr. Singer's first move was to evict Charas. That took more than two years and 110 police officers to haul away protesters who had chained themselves together.\n''The anger wasn't at Gregg, per se,'' said Lyn Pentecost, executive director of the Lower East Side Girls Club. But he had ''stepped into the thick of community politics.''\nAt one point, Ms. Pentecost said, she offered to buy a third of the building for the Girls Club for $3 million. She said Mr. Singer was interested only in leasing it.\n''He's an opportunist,'' said Valerio Orselli, a member of Charas. ''I don't believe for a minute that Mr. Singer intended it to be the community center we envisioned.''\nThe developer tells a different story: He says that Ms. López warned the Girls Club, and many other nonprofits, not to get involved with him. He said 108 schools and nonprofit and social service organizations responded to an appeal he sent to 1,000 groups, but they all backed out.\nNo doubt some potential tenants who visited the building were scared off by the frequent protests outside, so perhaps New York University, the New School and the New York Society for the Deaf decided to sidestep a volatile situation.\nJohn Caizzo, a vice president at the DeMatteis Organization, who decided on a different site for his company's project, acknowledged that the building ''seems like a hot potato.'' But no city officials told him to stay away, he said.\nBut Cecilia Abrilla, a director of the Puerto Rican Alliance, on the Lower East Side, wrote to Mr. Singer in 2003 saying Ms. López ''has cast a warning to the nonprofit community to stay away from Mr. Singer'' by threatening to withdraw financial support for the organizations.\nAnd a top city official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the litigation made it clear that the local community effectively has veto power. ''At the end of the day,'' the official said, Mr. Singer ''will have to find an accommodation with the community.''\nAfter a series of meetings in 2004 with Robert B. Tierney, chairman of the Landmarks Commission, Mr. Singer devised a plan to preserve the Ninth Street side of the old school while building a 19-story dormitory tower at the rear. He said as much as $2 million a year in excess revenue would flow to local groups. In return, according to the lawsuit, Mr. Tierney promised to refrain from landmarking and support a building permit.\nBut the proposal ignited broader opposition, and the Buildings Department denied him a permit after imposing what Mr. Singer called ''an unprecedented requirement'' that he prove that he had a contract with a specific school for the housing. City officials said they imposed the rule after unscrupulous developers had tried to convert ''dormitories'' into market-rate housing.\nDays later, Mr. Singer said, Ms. López, a Democrat, announced her endorsement of Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican with whom she had quarreled, rather than the challenger, Fernando Ferrer.\nMichael Rosen, who lives in the penthouse at Christadora House, formed a new group that lobbied to designate the school a city landmark. ''The thought of a dormitory, tall or short, was out of place in this neighborhood,'' he said, adding, ''My hope is that the building comes back to serve people who are in need.''\nMr. Singer scoffed, saying Mr. Rosen did not want his views blocked.\nIn June, the Landmarks Commission voted to designate P.S. 64 a landmark, over the objection of the Real Estate Board, a powerful lobbying organization. ''The building should never have been landmarked,'' Mr. Spinola, the board's president, said.\nFurther, he said, the city's new requirement for dormitories was tantamount to ''telling a commercial developer he must have leases before they'll give him a permit.''\nCity lawyers denied many of Mr. Singer's assertions. ''Landmarks never had a deal with him,'' said Gabriel Taussig of the Law Department. ''He had nothing in writing.''\nMr. Singer sued over the permit denial and lost. He is appealing.\nThe first, and so far only, attempt at a settlement came in July, when Mr. Singer met with Ms. Mendez, United States Representative Nydia Velázquez and a lawyer for the city. The two sides explored a proposal for Mr. Singer to provide space for community groups while he built apartments in the rest of the building.\nThe talks quickly collapsed, with each side blaming the other. That is when Mr. Singer stripped terra cotta elements and copper cornices from the building's exterior, a move the politicians saw as a breach of faith.\n''I'm disappointed that all the negotiations have broken down,'' said William Jones, pastor of the Gospel Fellowship Church nearby. ''I would've been thrilled if there was a compromise that allowed residential development and community space.''
1815975	Banks' Leases To Hedge Funds Are Questioned	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03EEDF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Inside a Philip Johnson-designed office tower in Boston's financial district, UBS, the giant Swiss bank, is running a ''hedge fund hotel.''\nLike a few other big investment banks, UBS leases space to ambitious young hedge fund traders as a temporary home, complete with receptionists, espresso machines and consultants to help manage their information systems.\nIn return, the banks hope the hedge fund hotel guests may become big clients.\nSome regulators, however, are growing concerned about the relationship between the banks and their hedge fund hotel guests, looking at whether the banks might be using the real estate relationship as a way to entice hedge funds to do business with them, possibly at the expense of their investors.\nWilliam F. Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of state, has subpoenaed UBS and is examining other banks with hedge fund hotels in Boston to determine how they are charging for their services. He is looking at whether hedge funds are paying higher than normal trading fees to banks to compensate them for the office space and failing to disclose this expense to investors.\n''It's a conflict of interest issue,'' Mr. Galvin said.\nUBS, which declined to comment, is the leader in this business, with 400,000 square feet of hedge fund hotels in a number of cities. Bear Stearns is also active, with space for rent in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\nWhile the state investigation is in a preliminary stage and may not lead to any specific charges, at its heart is a thorny issue that has dogged regulators for decades. Money managers, including mutual funds and hedge funds, often pay Wall Street with ''soft dollars'' -- inflated commissions that include the cost of trading (typically 1 to 2 cents a share) plus an additional few cents a share that can be directed to pay for research and other services.\nSoft dollars are controversial because clients pay for the higher commissions, while the services often benefit the manager the most. Higher commissions result in greater expenses for the fund and potentially lower returns for investors.\nIn the late 1990s, the Securities and Exchange Commission cracked down on the use of soft dollars by mutual funds, concerned that investors were being duped into paying for services enjoyed by the manager.\nMassachusetts is now investigating whether hedge funds are improperly using soft dollars to pay for space in these hotels and failing to disclose to investors that they are covering a major expense.\n''It's the same soft dollar question,'' Mr. Galvin said in an interview. ''What kind of quid pro quo might be in the placement of an order? What's the relationship between the entities?''\nAs hedge funds have exploded, so, too, have the fortunes of Wall Street, which earns billions of dollars a year in fees executing trades and lending money to hedge fund clients. Hedge funds typically trade more than other Wall Street clients and they trade exotic, high-margin products, like complex derivatives.\nBecause hedge funds have become such important customers, there are concerns that they may be receiving tips about pending mergers, for example, or other yet-to-be-disclosed news that could affect a stock price. Trading ahead of public disclosure would give a fund an advantage; while it generally would be illegal, it is often hard for regulators to detect or prove.\nTrading and the soft dollars used to pay for it are only one part of the business Wall Street does with hedge funds. The main business of servicing hedge funds is called prime brokerage. It includes financing trades; finding and lending stock to allow hedge funds to short stocks (betting that their price will fall); structuring derivatives; and executing swaps. It can also include hedge fund hotels -- securing real estate, receptionists and information technology and even managing, say, the risk of trading currencies in Asia.\nThe global prime brokerage business generates $8 billion to $10 billion a year, according to an estimate by the Vodia Group, a consulting firm for the financial services industry. The business is highly profitable, with a return on equity -- a measure of how efficiently the bank reinvests its capital -- of a healthy 15 to 20 percent. In 2006, Goldman Sachs made $2 billion directly servicing hedge funds, 22 percent more than the previous year.\nPrime brokerage is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the fees that hedge funds generate for Wall Street firms: billions of additional dollars come from trading for these funds. Credit Suisse estimates that investment banks made $25 billion in revenue from hedge funds in 2004, $19 billion of which came from sales and trading and the rest from prime brokerage.\nHedge funds now control half the volume traded on the New York and London Stock Exchanges, according to Credit Suisse.\nIn markets like convertible arbitrage, hedge funds control 70 percent of the trading. (In convertible arbitrage, an investor buys a bond that can be converted into stock and then sells that stock short, betting that its price will fall because of the sale of convertible bonds.)\n''Hedge funds generate about 30 to 35 percent of the equity commission volume of the major Wall Street firms,'' said Brad Hintz, a securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a respected Wall Street research firm that manages money for wealthy individuals and institutions. But that is only part of the equation.\n''Because a hedge fund has broad investment guidelines -- it is not constrained like a mutual fund to invest in certain stocks or certain sectors -- it allows the hedge fund to really go after some of the more financially attractive products the Street offers,'' Mr. Hintz said.\nIn the United States, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns lead the pack in prime brokerage, collectively controlling about 75 percent of the market, according to Sanford C. Bernstein, a unit of AllianceBernstein.\nBut neither Goldman nor Morgan Stanley run significant hedge fund hotel operations. (Goldman inherited a small business from Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, which it bought in 2000.)\nBear Stearns' hedge fund hotel clients tend to be small. Bear is unusual because it accepts only ''hard dollar'' arrangements, rather then venturing into the murky area of soft dollars.\nBank of America exited the hedge fund hotel business 18 months ago because of a lack of demand.\nLehman Brothers and Credit Suisse have been building their prime brokerage businesses. Lehman has space that it leases to a select group of clients, but it is not a major player in hotel space. Credit Suisse prefers to cater to a small number of institutional-quality hedge funds that are expanding into high-margin products like structured derivatives and reinsurance.\nJefferies, a bank that caters to midmarket clients, recruited a significant part of Bank of America's prime brokerage team to build its business. Glen Dailey, head of prime brokerage, said the hedge fund hotel business was too expensive to build at Bank of America.\n''It took a lot of resources, especially tech support,'' Mr. Dailey said. ''Clients would call because there wasn't coffee or hot water. In the end, we felt like the client service group was spending 80 percent of its time on the real estate.''\nCorrection: January 3, 2007, Wednesday Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about an investigation into the possibility that banks are luring hedge funds as tenants in order to solicit their trading business misstated the nature of a request made by the Massachusetts secretary of state, William F. Galvin, to UBS, the Swiss bank. While Mr. Galvin has requested information from UBS, he has not issued a subpoena. UBS is cooperating with the inquiry.
1815976	SPITZER IS SWORN AND BEGINS PUSH ON ETHICS RULES	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EEDF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Eliot Spitzer ended 12 years of Republican rule here on Monday with a blunt critique of the past and a call to ''end the politics of cynicism and division in our state.''\nWith his predecessor, George E. Pataki, gamely looking on, Governor Spitzer said in his 20-minute inaugural address that New York, ''like Rip van Winkle,'' had ''slept through much of the past decade.'' He pledged to undertake reforms ''substantial in size and historic in scope'' and hinted at some of the contentious battles to come, including his plans to reshape state Medicaid and ethics policies.\nThe speech was the beginning salvo in what many see as a gargantuan challenge Mr. Spitzer has set out for himself -- to overhaul a state government paralyzed by gridlock and consumed by recurring scandals. [News analysis, Page B1.]\nYet Mr. Spitzer's work began hours before the speech: He signed five executive orders before 9 a.m., including directives establishing new ethical guidelines for state workers, among them a ban on accepting almost any gifts, as well as new restrictions on lobbying and the use of state resources. He also barred elected officials or candidates from appearing in advertisements paid for by state entities, a frequent practice of Mr. Pataki.\nIn his speech, Mr. Spitzer, 47, laid out what he said were ''two overarching objectives'': making the government ''ethical and wise,'' and rebuilding the economy. He has said that addressing the struggling upstate economy would be a particular priority, but acknowledged the difficulty in reviving regions like the Buffalo area that have seen an exodus of manufacturing jobs.\nThe speech capped a whirlwind day in which the new governor took the official oath of office at midnight and, after sleeping about three hours, arose for a two-mile run through a chilly Albany rain. The rain stopped before the inauguration, though temperatures stayed in the 40s. After his 1 p.m. address, he revived an Albany tradition by opening the Executive Mansion to the public, and he and his wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, received 1,200 well-wishers. The inaugural speech was itself a break with tradition in that it was held outdoors, with Mr. Spitzer clad in a suit but no overcoat for the hourlong ceremony.\nThe change of leadership seemed to electrify a capital that has had Mr. Pataki as its governor for the last 12 years. Democrats were elated at the prospect of being at the seat of power for the first time since Mario M. Cuomo was voted out of office in 1994, while Republicans feared that Mr. Spitzer's ascension could weaken their already tenuous hold on the State Senate, their only redoubt of power. Lobbyists, gathering for the legislative session that begins this week, worried about how the new power structure would affect their work.\nHovering over the inauguration was the fallout from the ethical scandals that have enveloped Albany. Only three of the four statewide officials elected in November took their oaths, because the comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, resigned late last month and pleaded guilty to a felony after admitting to using state workers to chauffeur and act as companions for his ailing wife.\nOne of Mr. Spitzer's executive orders, prohibiting the use of state property, including vehicles, computers and telephones, for nonofficial business, seemed aimed at curbing such behavior. The order said that individuals authorized by their agency to use a vehicle for personal purposes ''shall keep records of such use, and the value of such personal use shall be calculated and reported as personal income.''\nIn his address, Mr. Spitzer said, ''Over the last decade, we have seen what can happen when our government stands still in the face of great challenge.''\n''Today is the day when all of that changes,'' he added.\nHis pointed attacks on Albany's problems ruffled some Republican feathers.\nAsked about the Rip Van Winkle line specifically, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, now the state's top Republican, said, ''I don't agree with that.''\n''I think history will judge the last 12 years, with this governor that's exiting, to have been one of the most productive 12 years for the people of New York State,'' he said. ''And history will judge that -- not rhetoric.''\nMr. Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, have essentially been running the state with Mr. Pataki for the last decade. Mr. Silver, for his part, said he took no offense, adding, ''I think it was very clear that his references were to the prior administration.''\nThe new governor began the new year at the Executive Mansion, where he was sworn in at midnight by Judge Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Spitzer was once a clerk for Judge Sweet, who also swore him in later at the public inauguration.\nMost of the major political figures in the state were present at the afternoon ceremony, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and much of the state's Congressional delegation. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was in Washington attending memorial services for former President Gerald R. Ford. After Mr. Spitzer's speech, Judy Collins sang ''This Little Light of Mine,'' a song that had been used in one of Mr. Spitzer's political ads during the campaign.\nFurther symbolizing the return of Democratic rule was the swearing-in of Andrew M. Cuomo as attorney general to replace Mr. Spitzer. His father, the former governor, was by his side. David A. Paterson was sworn in as lieutenant governor, the first African-American to hold the post.\nThe new attorney general signaled that he, too, would begin moving to confront the ethical challenges in the capital, as Mr. Cuomo planned meetings Tuesday with the Albany Country district attorney, P. David Soares, who prosecuted Mr. Hevesi, and David Grandeau, the head of the state's Lobbying Commission.\nAll in all, it was a day characterized by a rush of activity in a capital where Mr. Pataki had been increasingly invisible.\nIn signing his executive orders, Mr. Spitzer said he was fulfilling a promise ''that one of the first acts I would take as governor, officially, was to put in place a series of ethics guidelines and strictures that would begin the process of restoring government to what it should be, which is responsive, open, transparent, available to the public.\n''I am hoping that others in other branches will join me in this,'' he added.\nMr. Spitzer prohibited nepotism in hiring and contracting, and barred former state workers from lobbying the agency or authority where they worked for two years after their departure. State employment officials were also barred from asking job candidates about their party affiliation.\nMr. Spitzer also prohibited state workers from making contributions to the campaigns of the governor or lieutenant governor, or affiliated political action committees.\n''I do not believe it looks proper for individuals who work for the governor, the lieutenant governor, to be making contributions,'' Mr. Spitzer said, adding, ''the appearance might be that they have been expected to do so, or it is a condition of employment. None of that should exist.''\nHe signed the orders on a desk once used by Theodore Roosevelt, in a room of the mansion known as the History Room, which also displays a wheelchair used by Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nAfter Mr. Spitzer finished and had answered some questions, he strode out of the room, but he and his wife quickly came back after his dogs Jesse, a bichon frisé, and James, a wheaten terrier, bolted in and began barking at reporters, one of several appearances the dogs made throughout the day.\nIn his inaugural address, attempting to outline his political philosophy, Mr. Spitzer called for New York to ''embrace a progressive vision of government once more, one that upholds the values of individuality and community; of entrepreneurship and opportunity; of responsibility and fairness.''\n''No one any longer believes in government as a heavy hand that can cure all our ills,'' he said, ''but rather we see it as a lean and responsive force that can make possible the pursuit of prosperity and opportunity for all, by softening life's blows, leveling its playing field and making possible the pursuit of happiness that is our God-given right.''
1815977	For Youths Fresh Out of Jail, a Little Help Staying Out	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEEDF1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	After serving six months for strong-arm robbery, Frank Stephens left Rikers Island nearly five years ago in the same manner as most inmates. Just as dawn broke in April, a Department of Correction van dropped the 17-year-old and about 30 other convicts at Queensborough Plaza, among the ''homeless, a lot of prostitutes, and crackheads'' on the street that morning, he said. He shared a few of his $22 with three other teenage convicts, before hopping on the train home to Brownsville, Brooklyn.\n''Maybe they made it, like me,'' Mr. Stephens, now 21, said of the other convicts he was released with. ''Or, maybe they fell back into old habits.''\nHalf of all Rikers inmates serving city sentences of a year or less are back in jail within a year, according to the Correction Department. Juvenile advocates argue that Queensborough Plaza -- where they estimate 10 teenage convicts are dropped off each week -- is for many of them the first step on a path back to jail, as they slip back into the city alone, without help assimilating. Even department officials say the plaza, having always been the closest transportation hub to Rikers since it opened as a jail in 1932, is not the ideal place for any newly released convict, young or old.\n''It's the time when they're most vulnerable,'' said Kathleen Coughlin, the Correction Department deputy commissioner.\nOver the past three years, the Correction Department has offered adults -- who make up the bulk of the 13,500 daily inmate population at Rikers -- an alternative to being dropped off at Queensborough Plaza, in addition to the option of being picked up by friends or family.\nUpon release from Rikers, adults can instead get a ride directly to job sites or aftercare programs sponsored by nonprofits. Now some nonprofits that serve the small population of young inmates at Rikers are also offering juveniles this option. Experts in the field say aftercare programs are crucial to preventing recidivism.\nBut while many adults embrace the opportunity, the response from young inmates has been lukewarm. It seems many, even those returning repeatedly to jail, prefer to fend for themselves.\n''I'm taking a cab straight to my girlfriend's house,'' said Radell Murray, 18, an inmate who said he was serving his fourth sentence at Rikers in two years for charges including assault and selling crack.\nThe illusion of invincibility that plagues young inmates is mostly absent among the adult inmate population, said Merle Lefkowitz, the deputy executive director of Rikers Island Discharge Enhancement.\nThe Correction Department started the RIDE program for adults in 2003, shortly after its newly appointed commissioner, Martin F. Horn, met with city agencies and nonprofits to address inmate needs. Today several nonprofits with offices on Rikers Island assist adult inmates with aftercare planning and offer rides upon their release.\nMore than two-thirds of those released from prison or jail nationwide are readmitted within three years, Ms. Coughlin said. ''Our early numbers on this indicate that if we keep people engaged 90 days after jail, we have about a 70 percent rate of keeping them out,'' she said.\nThis year, for inmates age 16 to 18, the department financed the Adolescent Re-entry Initiative program, run by the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice, Ms. Coughlin said. And two nonprofits, the Fortune Society and Friends of Island Academy, each recently bought vans to transport juveniles home or to their own aftercare programs.\nBut so far, adult inmates appear far more interested in aftercare, with half the population signing up with RIDE, Ms. Lefkowitz said. As for those who do not plan for their lives after jail, ''unfortunately, we'll have another shot at them because they'll end up back here,'' she said.\nThat is why juvenile advocates say they have been considering new ways to ensure that young inmates sign up for aftercare. In the past 17 years, Friends of Island Academy has provided counseling, education and job training to 4,500 young convicts who have found their way to its Midtown office, said its director, Beth Navon. The organization recently began holding a weekly outreach workshop at Island Academy, the New York City alternative high school on Rikers Island, where it is now trying to encourage young inmates to take its van directly to its offices upon their release.\nOn a recent Tuesday, Charles Crum, 18, an inmate, listened attentively during a ''Know Your Rights'' workshop led by a Friends of Island Academy staff member, Tongo Eisen-Martin.\nMr. Crum said that after he was kicked out of high school he began ''being bad,'' by robbing people and dealing crack. Today he is working to earn his G.E.D. at Island Academy, where peers call him ''Far Rock,'' after his neighborhood of Far Rockaway, Queens. He and a dozen others vied for Mr. Eisen-Martin's attention by shouting out personal experiences.\n''They be stopping me for no reason,'' said Carlos Rivas, 18, who is serving four months for robbery. ''Sometimes they don't have anything on you, they just lie.''\n''We're not constitutional superheroes; this is really all just to live to fight another day in court, you know what I'm saying?'' Mr. Eisen-Martin replied to Mr. Rivas, after explaining his rights under police questioning.\nThe weekly presence and persistence at the academy have persuaded some to take a chance on the van that Friends of Island Academy bought with a $10,000 private grant. And Ms. Navon said she was applying for another grant to finance an additional weekly workshop at the academy, allowing Mr. Eisen-Martin to reach out to more young inmates regarding planning for their lives after jail.\nLorenzo Ross, 18, a resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, serving his second sentence for gun possession, said he had planned to reform after his first stay at Rikers, ''but I repeat the same mistakes.'' When he is released in February, he said, he plans instead to take the Friends van to its office at 330 West 38th Street.\n''I want to take advantage of everything they're offering,'' Mr. Ross said.\nBut aftercare does not work for all, Ms. Navon said. Many come from abusive or neglectful households, with little education and job training.\nOf the about 800 adolescents on Rikers Island at any give time, half are junior high school dropouts and half are reading below a sixth-grade level, said Frank Dody, the principal of Island Academy.\nMs. Navon said 80 percent of those who had completed the Friends of Island Academy programs had not returned to jail.\nMr. Stephens -- who was arrested in 2002 after beating up a classmate and stealing his money during a fight in the cafeteria -- has not gone back to Rikers since he served his six-month sentence.\nHis parole officer referred him to Friends of Island Academy after his high school refused to readmit him.\nMr. Stephens earned his G.E.D. through Friends and now works there as a youth leader.\nHe said more young convicts would benefit by choosing the Friends van, ''especially teenagers whose families are blind to the fact that they're free.''\n''It's sort of like somebody out there cares you're home,'' he said.
1815978	A Budget Official Shapes An Agency Into Relevance	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E7DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	She cautioned against diverting budget surpluses to increase spending, suggested some tax increases, warned how much the unpopular Fresh Kills landfill would cost to close and even raised the possibility of imposing tolls on the free East River bridges -- all issues that most politicians would shun.\nAnd yet, last month Ronnie Lowenstein was not only re-elected, but also won unanimously.\n''Winning an election with four votes is no small thing,'' she said.\nMs. Lowenstein, a 55-year-old economist, was reappointed as director of New York City's Independent Budget Office. When the office was created 10 years ago, some city officials dismissed the position as another redundant municipal agency. But in the decade under Ms. Lowenstein's leadership, the office has proved itself, political leaders and nonprofit watchdog groups say.\n''If there were any concerns that existed before, I think they have been dispelled,'' Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. said. ''An extra set of eyes is always helpful.''\nMs. Lowenstein joined the office in 1996 from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and in 2000 was named director to fill out her predecessor's unexpired term. Reappointed in 2002, she has just been named to a second four-year term by Mr. Thompson; Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum; Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker; and Helen M. Marshall of Queens on behalf of her fellow borough presidents.\nMs. Lowenstein has sought to be scrupulously neutral, even switching her voter registration from Democrat to independent (which, she acknowledged, virtually disenfranchised her in her heavily Democratic Manhattan neighborhood).\n''They don't have an ax to grind,'' said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group, referring to the budget office staff.\nMs. Lowenstein's hope has been to position the office as honest broker in the budget debate. The office has no policy-making role but provides nonpartisan budget, economic and policy analyses to elected officials and to New Yorkers.\n''It takes a long time to build credibility,'' she said. ''You're only as good as your last report.''\n''The boring people like me thought we should be doing research that didn't take policy positions but just informed the debate,'' she said in an interview last week. ''Initially, we really didn't know who our audience was. We were so technical that we were virtually incomprehensible. It took us a long time to take sophisticated research and translate it in ways that made it accessible.''\nBy most accounts, the office succeeded, in its published and Web site versions of reports, analyses of budget options and fiscal overview. After early challenges from the Giuliani administration, she said, relations with the Bloomberg administration ''have taken another quantum step forward.''\n''I admit I was one of those people who said we don't need another fiscal monitor,'' she said. ''Our goal was to become everyone's first source for objective information on taxes and budget, and I think we've done that. We're able to take on a broader range of topics that an elected official just won't touch and lay out the alternatives. Even though we don't advocate for change, those are uncomfortable things to be saying if you're an elected official.''\nThe City Charter guarantees the office at least 10 percent of the money allotted to the mayor's Office of Management and Budget. ''That has been a huge factor in keeping us independent,'' she said. ''We've never gotten a penny more than that.''\nShe cited suggestions that with additional resources, her office might delve more into measuring municipal performance, perhaps even compiling the indicators that now constitute the mayor's periodic management report.\n''If that were given to us, would we do it well? Yes,'' she said, but added in her typically noncommittal way, ''Does that mean it should be? Not necessarily.''\nAnother of Ms. Lowenstein's goals is to make the municipal budget more transparent so government officials and citizens alike can easily determine how much the city is spending for, say, housing homeless women and how the amount compares with that of other periods.\nIn 2007, she said, the challenge for the city will be how to deal with an embarrassment of riches, which can pose more challenges than a deficit because of pressures to cut taxes, increase spending or take less politically popular steps to reduce the city's long-term debt.\n''The city is in stronger fiscal shape than it has been for a long time,'' she said, ''but it would appear that longer term, those budget gaps haven't gone away. In the short term, the debate will be how to handle a surplus. It's often the most contentious.''
1815979	Arrest After Fire at a Rival's Food Shop	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E7DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Back when things were simple -- when the Twin Donuts sold doughnuts and the Kennedy Fried Chicken next door sold fried chicken -- all was peaceful, city officials said. The stores shared a common roof and a common wall, at 876 Hunts Point Avenue in the Bronx, but had different doors, different rents and a different customer base.\nThen, a few weeks ago, the owner of the Twin Donuts sold the store to a new entrepreneur. The new owner introduced new items to his menu, including steak sandwiches, mozzarella sticks and fried chicken, according to Robert Pinto, a New York City fire marshal.\n''The chicken guy was mad at the doughnut guy because the doughnut guy started selling fried chicken, and the doughnut guy was undercutting the chicken guy's prices by 50 cents a plate,'' Mr. Pinto said. ''The chicken guy was losing a lot of business and he had gotten some violations from the Health Department. So he was going to plan on shutting his business down and renovating to correct the health code violations. At the same time he was feuding with the doughnut guy, telling the doughnut guy not to sell the chicken.''\nSo after closing time on Sunday, the fire marshal said, the owner of Kennedy Fried Chicken decided to send a clear message to his chicken competitor. He punched a hole in the wall between the two stores with a hammer, Mr. Pinto said.\nThen, he sprayed gasoline that he had put in a 32-ounce fruit juice container through the hole and ignited it with a match, Mr. Pinto said. The Kennedy Fried Chicken owner then closed his store and left, he said.\nFirefighters arrived shortly after 4 a.m. on Monday to a two-alarm fire. The flames had destroyed the doughnut shop and damaged part of the fried chicken store, Mr. Pinto said.\nBut when the owner of the fried chicken shop showed up at the scene, he did not seem distraught, which aroused suspicions, Mr. Pinto said.\nAnother fire marshal discovered the hole in the wall, which matched a hammer they also found in the wreckage, Mr. Pinto said.\nWhen questioned, the owner of the Kennedy Fried Chicken, Kabeer Ahmad, told the authorities about the rivalry and confessed that he had set the fire, Mr. Pinto said. Mr. Ahmad, 32, was arrested and charged with arson.
1815980	The Neediest Cases; In Student's Success, Mother Sees Many Helping Hands	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E7DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	On a recent morning here, Alma Garrick Smith showed off a PowerPoint presentation that highlighted the many academic accomplishments of her daughter, Brittany Smith.\nThe proud mother planned to give copies of the presentation as a gift of gratitude to friends and family who have helped the teenager.\nMs. Smith, 18, has never been affected by the violence and drugs that plague her surroundings. She has always excelled in school but is modest about her achievements.\n''Everyone talks so badly about Newburgh,'' the young woman said, alluding to the fact that Newburgh is a violent city. ''My mother always says, our home starts at the front door,'' she said.\nMs. Smith started setting standards for herself at an early age, her mother said, recalling the first time her daughter received what she perceived as an unsatisfactory grade.\n''In elementary school she came home crying because she received a 90,'' Mrs. Smith said. ''It was the first time she did not receive a 100.''\nWhen the family lived in Mount Vernon and Ms. Smith was in the third grade, she had the option of skipping two grades, but her mother declined the offer, believing that in terms of maturity, the quick advance was not a good idea.\nMrs. Smith was not satisfied with the school system in Mount Vernon, and she and her husband, Willie, decided to relocate to Newburgh when their daughter was 10 years old.\n''I just wanted Brittany to have a better life,'' she said. ''I wanted her to see something different.''\nWith all of their belongings packed into Mr. Smith's work van, they stayed with relatives for a few weeks until they were able to find an apartment of their own.\nAs they returned to Mount Vernon to pick up a few more items, the van -- along with all their possessions -- was stolen, which made them even more resolute about the move. Once back in Newburgh, they found an apartment that happened to be across the street from the Orange County Chapter of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.\nSister Joanne Dress heads the chapter, and when Mrs. Smith told her about the family's ordeal, Sister Dress provided them with furniture, clothes, and even Christmas gifts.\nMrs. Smith, who had worked for 13 years as a counselor for the New York State Division for Youth, has also faced health problems. In 1993, she received a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, and arthritis was found in her back. Also afflicted with a Baker's cyst, a knee ailment, in her right leg, Mrs. Smith is unable to work and receives $1,173 a month in Social Security disability payments.\n''I kind of blocked the diagnosis out because it meant that I wasn't able to work anymore,'' she said. ''And it was hard for me. Emotionally, it was hard for me.''\nHer husband does construction work as a roofer, and his salary pays most of the household bills. But the work is often not steady because of the weather.\nRelying on her disability check, which arrives on the third Wednesday of every month, Mrs. Smith frequently finds herself late on her $875 rent. With her landlord charging $100 each month for the lateness, it is hard for the family to get ahead.\nMs. Smith graduated from Newburgh Free Academy in June and was in the top five percent of her class. She had also earned an academic scholarship to Cornell University. Next, she just had to find a way to get to the campus to meet the dean and make sure that this was the school she wanted to attend.\n''I got my acceptance letter to Cornell on April 1st; I never expected to get accepted there,'' Ms. Smith said. ''I thought it was an April Fools' joke.''\nWith the family's income split between paying rent and maintaining the household, the Smiths did not have enough to pay for prescriptions, let alone a three-day trip for two to upstate New York.\nWith help from relatives, the Smiths were able to book a hotel room in Ithaca, leaving them only in need of bus tickets to the campus.\nIt was then Mrs. Smith reached out to a familiar hand and called on Sister Dress. Through the Neediest Cases, the Smiths received $142 to purchase two round-trip bus tickets to Cornell.\nMs. Smith, who has completed her first semester as a freshman at Cornell, is considering chemistry as a major. With help from her uncle, she was able to buy textbooks for the semester.\nAs in the old African proverb, ''It takes a village to raise a child,'' Mrs. Smith realizes that she could not have done it on her own.\n''It took a lot of people to get Brittany where she is today, and I'm just so grateful to all of them,'' she said.\nHOW TO HELP\nChecks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245, or any of these organizations:\nBROOKLYN BUREAU OF COMMUNITY SERVICE 285 Schermerhorn Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES, DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS 191 Joralemon Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK 1011 First Avenue New York, N.Y. 10022\nCHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nFEDERATION OF PROTESTANT WELFARE AGENCIES 281 Park Avenue South New York, N.Y. 10010\nUJA-FEDERATION OF NEW YORK Church Street Station P.O.

1815981	On the Democrats' Day of Days, the Old Guard Sits Together One More Time; A Notable Absence	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E7DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Spitzer inaugural festivities drew a rare, nearly complete who's who of Democratic and Republican politicians in New York, save for one rather conspicuous absentee: Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nMrs. Clinton was tentatively scheduled to attend, but she bowed out after Betty Ford asked that she and former President Bill Clinton join other first families to pay respects to President Gerald R. Ford in the Capitol rotunda. The Clintons also met privately with Mrs. Ford.\nMrs. Clinton's name was printed in the inaugural program, however, and a number of New Yorkers at the ceremony said they were surprised when the M.C. greeted Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Charles B. Rangel by name -- as well as ''the entire Congressional delegation'' -- but made no mention of Senator Clinton.\nNew York's power brokers do not frequently assemble in the same place at the same time, unless it's to mark a funeral or tragedy. Seated among one another were the new governor and three former ones, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Senator Schumer, the various members of Congress, City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, a number of legislators, and a lot of lobbyists.\nSenator Clinton and Mr. Spitzer have a good working relationship, the governor's advisers said, and they sat down with him for a long brunch last month to discuss her possible presidential campaign. Advisers to Senator Clinton did not return phone calls about her private schedule yesterday.\nPATRICK HEALY
1815982	On the Democrats' Day of Days, the Old Guard Sits Together One More Time; A Morning Jog, as Promised	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E7DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	The sky was pitch black and a steady rain was falling when Mr. Spitzer arrived in Washington Park at 5:43 a.m. yesterday to keep his first campaign promise: taking a morning run through the park on his first day in office.\n''I have one simple question: Whose idea was this?'' Mr. Spitzer joked after he entered the lake house to cheers from friends, supporters and local residents. He marveled that old friends from college -- ''People who would never have been up this early'' -- had managed to rouse themselves from bed in the wee hours of New Year's Day.\nLeading a pack of more than 100 runners -- dozens of them wearing blue T-shirts with the slogan ''Day One Everything Is Changing'' -- Mr. Spitzer wound his way west along the lake; up a hill toward State Street, one of the city's most elegant and historic thoroughfares; past the Soldiers and Sailors Monument; and along a bridle path back to the lake house. The route was just short of two miles.\nThe new governor ran in the New York City Marathon in 1983, finishing just under four hours. He said he went to bed at 1:30 a.m. yesterday after being officially sworn in and woke up when ''the internal clock started kicking in about 4:30, because I thought I'd be late'' for the run.\nSEWELL CHAN
1815983	On the Democrats' Day of Days, the Old Guard Sits Together One More Time; 'It's Our Turn'	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E7DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Shortly before 1 p.m. yesterday, George Arzt, a media consultant and lobbyist based in New York City, stood on the grass in West Capitol Park, waiting for the inauguration ceremony to begin.\n''It's our turn,'' he said, meaning the Democrats, as he gazed contentedly at one of the large video screens nearby. ''Can you feel it?''\nFor Mr. Arzt, as for others, the arrival of a new Democratic governor was a pleasant occasion for several reasons. It was good, he said, to see so many friends and acquaintances in the crowd. It was good to see a Democrat back in the governor's office after 12 years of Republican rule, he said. And it was also good that the Democrat in question is an old client and comrade: Mr. Arzt was a media consultant for Mr. Spitzer's successful 1998 run for the attorney general's office.\n''Obviously, I'll have access here when I need it,'' he said. ''But clearly it's fantastic to have someone in office who is so confident and innovative.''\nAs Mr. Spitzer spoke about the urgent need to reform state government, Mr. Arzt looked on with something like familial pride. He glanced around the crowd, recognizing familiar faces, picking out new ones. ''Lots of city people here,'' Mr. Arzt pronounced. ''Everyone wants to get reacquainted. A lot of people are just happy to see their friends.''\nA few minutes after Mr. Spitzer's address, Mr. Arzt ran into another old acquaintance -- Jeffrey S. Wiesenfeld, a former aide to George E. Pataki.\n''You think the next governor will give the same speech?'' Mr. Wiesenfeld asked, imagining Mr. Spitzer's eventual departure.\n''Maybe, if he's from a different party,'' Mr. Arzt responded.\n''I don't know,'' said Mr. Wiesenfeld, who recalled Mr. Pataki's first inauguration speech, also heavy on calls for change. ''It sounded awfully familiar to me.''\nNICHOLAS CONFESSORE
1815984	On the Democrats' Day of Days, the Old Guard Sits Together One More Time; A Long Wait, a Big Thrill	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E7DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Cyndy Hall began volunteering for Democratic campaigns in 1968, making phone calls on behalf of Eugene J. McCarthy, but she never felt as politically satisfied, she said yesterday, as she did with the election and inauguration of Mr. Spitzer.\n''This was the campaign that made you jump out of bed and want to get to work,'' said Ms. Hall, a retired music teacher who is active in Democratic politics in Claverack, N.Y. ''I have never, in all these decades, seen a candidate with integrity like Spitzer's, or the ability to fight all the big guys for all of us little guys.''\nAfter eight years of prosecuting white-collar fraud at powerful corporations, Mr. Spitzer has won a following among die-hard liberal and economic progressives like Ms. Hall, just as there are plenty of industry leaders who loathe his aggressive legal tactics. And the die-hards came out in strong numbers to attend the free inaugural ceremony yesterday.\nSome of the most enthusiastic Spitzerites (or Spitzans, or Spitzeristas) tried in vain to get last-minute tickets for Mr. Spitzer's receiving line at the governor's mansion, which was eventually limited to 1,200 people, most of whom had requested tickets in advance. Those who got in were delighted to see Spitzer family photographs on the mantel and shelves, and posters showing swearing-in ceremonies through the ages -- for governors like Franklin D. Roosevelt, Hugh L. Carey and (just after midnight) Mr. Spitzer.\n''They also had on display New York's original copy of the U.S. Constitution,'' said Mary Lou Darling of Niskayuna, N.Y. ''And Mr. And Mrs. Spitzer were so cordial, even though they must've been exhausted. It made you proud to be a New Yorker.''\nPATRICK HEALY

But who knew that they have matching bright orange scarves for outdoor occasions? It turns out that the matching orange neckwear was distributed by the court's chief judge, Judith S. Kaye, who took a liking to the scarves when she attended Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's second inauguration in New York City last year.\nThe mayor's staff had given the orange scarves to volunteers at the ceremony, according to a Bloomberg aide. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch liked them so much that he asked a volunteer for one. Judge Kaye did the same. And several weeks ago, Judge Kaye contacted Patricia E. Harris, the first deputy mayor, and asked if the city had any left. City officials found other scarves and sent them to Albany for use by the other judges.\n''I think it was entirely a style and warmth decision,'' said Gary Spencer, a spokesman for the court.\nSEWELL CHAN

Even as a young girl in the Dominican Republic, she worked as a stylist at her aunt's salon, her family said. Without any formal training, they said, she intuitively did a delicate, elaborate dance with scissors, combs and blow dryers.\nStyling led her to opportunities in the Bronx; Providence, R.I.; and Middletown, N.Y. The last place was where she finally opened up her own salon, Final Cuts by Fermina, and she hoped she would be able to buy her first house for her and her four sons.\nHer love for her job was such, her family said, that she often stayed at her salon well past its official closing time. That happened on Saturday night, the police said, when she stayed past the normal 10 p.m. closing to help three clients primp for New Year's Eve.\nAbout 11:55, a man walked into the salon, at 133 Wickham Avenue in Middletown, and told Ms. Nunez and her three customers to lie face down on the floor, said Gregory Metakes, a spokesman for the Middletown Police Department. The man asked Ms. Nunez how to open the cash register. When he couldn't, he became angry, walked over to her with a small-caliber handgun, and shot her once in the back of the head, according to witness accounts given to the police.\nThe man, said to be about 5 feet 6 inches tall, more than 200 pounds, and wearing a black hood and a Yankees cap, fled, but it was unclear if he left on foot or in a vehicle, the police said.\nLate last night, officers from Middletown and the state police took a man in the Bronx River section of the Bronx into custody in connection with the killing, and moved him to Middletown for questioning. Domonic Simone, 49, who lives on the street where the man was taken into custody, said that about 9 p.m., ''I heard two shots and at first I thought they were fireworks because last night there were fireworks.''\nMs. Nunez's death, in addition to devastating her four sons -- Anthony, 18; Michael, 16; Chris, 15; and Brian, 13 -- five brothers and sisters, and 21 nieces and nephews, has also stunned her loyal customers, many of whom showed up last night bearing cards, flowers and votive candles that they placed outside her salon.\nCharnell Tootle, 29, said she liked to get her hair done by Ms. Nunez since she was the only one in town who could do a doobie the way she liked it -- a style in which the hair is set in rollers and then blown out to cover the face.\n''Fermina was the only one who knew this particular hairstyle,'' said Ms. Tootle, who dropped off a heart-shaped balloon last night. She said she had started taking her two young daughters to the salon.\n''Her shop felt comfortable and homey,'' Ms. Tootle said.\nMs. Nunez, who was 36, loved Middletown and lobbied her siblings to move there. It was quieter and safer than in the Bronx, she argued.\nTwo of her siblings had moved there and a third planned to do so this year.\n''She wanted to get us away from the crime, and the crime came to us,'' said Juan Nunez, 37, one of her brothers who lives in Middletown. The family said last night that they would keep the salon open. They say they know she would have wanted it that way.

Each is interested in hiring Barber in a hybrid role, with assignments in news and sports.\nLepselter said that no decision on the offers had been reached, and that the networks had not been notified of Barber's intentions.\n''Tiki and I have decided that we are not announcing anything until after the Giants' playoff run ends -- in February, hopefully,'' Lepselter said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''In fairness to the organization, Tiki wants his focus to be strictly on the team.''\nA report on the New York Post's Web site said that Barber was expected to sign a four-year, $10 million offer to work for ABC and ESPN, including roles on ABC's ''Good Morning America'' and ''20/20.'' Lepselter called the report erroneous. An ABC spokesman did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\nPRO FOOTBALL
1815988	Mangini vs. Belichick Echoes a Past N.F.L. Reunion	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E6DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	The family reunion featured the usual menu of gratitude mixed with grudges. Those who follow football ate it up and asked for seconds and thirds. It got to the point where the players in the postseason game between the rookie head coach and his mentor wished they could be excused from the table.\n''It seems like it's going to be like the Super Bowl a little bit because there's so much hype on this game,'' said the mentor's star safety.\nIt was not Rodney Harrison of the New England Patriots referring to Sunday's American Football Conference wild-card playoff game between the Patriots and the Jets. The speaker was Green Bay's LeRoy Butler, and he was talking before the 1998 National Football Conference championship game between Mike Holmgren's Green Bay Packers and Steve Mariucci's San Francisco 49ers.\nBefore Eric Mangini took over the Jets and guided them to Sunday's all-or-nothing showdown against his former boss, Bill Belichick, Mariucci was the prodigal son of the postseason and Holmgren was the mad genius.\nMariucci, who had been an assistant under Holmgren in Green Bay for four years, was hired by the 49ers before the 1997 season after a one-year stint as the coach at California.\nMariucci's ties to the Packers made him a prime catch in the eyes of the 49ers, who were motivated to end a losing streak against Green Bay. The 49ers had three consecutive defeats to the Packers, two of them in the postseason. In Mariucci, the Niners believed they had somebody who could beat the Packers at their own game.\nWhen the Jets hired Mangini away from Belichick last January, they were in the midst of a six-game losing streak against the Patriots, their A.F.C. East rival and the dominant team of this decade. Woody Johnson, the Jets' owner, said, ''Eric brings with him great credentials.'' Since Mangini never had been a head coach, Johnson's comments were widely interpreted to mean that he was plucked from the most fruitful tree.\n''I don't think it's a coincidence that Coach Mangini happened to come to the top of the list for this particular job as opposed to the seven or eight others that came up last year,'' offensive lineman Pete Kendall said. ''When you look around the coaching changes every year, I think that most hires are based on a guy's expected success within the division, their knowledge within the division.''\nIn the days before the 49ers' game against the Packers, Mariucci acknowledged having fantasized about a possible playoff matchup with his mentor.\n''I've played this game in my mind for 11 months,'' Mariucci, who is an analyst for the NFL Network, said at the time. He added: ''I'm going through this week with a little bit different feeling in my stomach. Instead of butterflies in my stomach, I think they're pterodactyls.''\nMangini is not the type to talk about any kind of stomach discomfort except, perhaps, hunger pangs. On Monday, he would not even admit to having followed the game Sunday night between the 49ers and the Denver Broncos. If the Broncos had won or tied, the Jets would have played at Indianapolis this weekend. Because the 49ers won in overtime, the Jets got the Patriots on the road.\nMangini said his 2-year-old son, Jake, had gotten his fill of football watching the Jets' 23-3 victory against the Oakland Raiders at Giants Stadium earlier in the day, so they ended up playing Candyland instead of watching the game. He said this without blinking in front of a media gathering that was easily twice as large as his normal Monday briefings.\nAsked what his reaction was when he learned in a telephone call from General Manager Mike Tannenbaum that his next opponent would be his last employer, Mangini said brightly: ''I think it's great. I'm excited about the challenge of the next week.''\nWhen Mariucci was asked about Holmgren before the N.F.C. title game, he spoke well of him and said, ''The greatest thing he taught me was the importance of chemistry on a team.''\nMangini said the greatest lesson he learned during his six years working under Belichick in New England was the value of character.\n''Character is so important, not just when you're winning but really when you're losing,'' he said. ''When things are tough, when it's hard to come to work, when it's hard to sacrifice because it's not going the way you want it to go, those are the guys that continue to fight.''\nIn the week leading up to the 1998 N.F.C. title game, Holmgren, whose cordial relationship with Mariucci cooled a bit after Mariucci got the 49ers job and hired away Green Bay's offensive coordinator, Marty Mornhinweg, said he was proud of what Mariucci had accomplished in his first year.\n''But the game's not going to be about the two of us,'' Holmgren said. Then he went out and coached his Packers to a 23-10 victory.\nBecause Belichick has steadfastly refused to give Mangini any credit for the job he has done with the Jets, Mangini knew better than to say this week's game was not going to be about the two of them.\n''My thoughts are exactly the same as they've been for the first two games,'' Mangini said. ''My approach is no different. My feelings are no different. I respect and appreciate all the things that he's done for me throughout the course of my career and that's never going to change. That's how I view it.''\nThe ties that bind coaches and protégés in games where only the winner survives to play another week can be frayed even in the best of situations. When the relationship is frayed to begin with, they can unravel.\nKendall was asked if the coaching subplot interests him. He answered, ''Sort of in the way that a car accident does.''\nPRO FOOTBALL
1815989	Green and Mora Fired; More Changes Expected	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E6DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	As the N.F.L. head coaching carousel began to spin, Dennis Green and Jim Mora became the first to lose their jobs.\nGreen was fired yesterday by the Arizona Cardinals, and Mora was fired by the Atlanta Falcons. Questions lingered about the futures of several other coaches. Would Nick Saban remain with the Miami Dolphins, or would he be lured away by the University of Alabama? Would Bill Cowher return for another year with the Pittsburgh Steelers, or would he resign after 15 seasons? Would Art Shell survive as the Oakland Raiders' coach after a 2-14 season, their worst record since 1963?\nThose questions will be answered in the next days and weeks, but the Cardinals and the Falcons wasted little time heading in new directions, only one day after the regular season ended. The Cardinals have begun their coaching search and have focused on at least four candidates -- Norm Chow, the offensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans; Ron Rivera, the defensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears; Jim Caldwell, the assistant head coach with the Indianapolis Colts; and Mike Sherman, the assistant head coach with the Houston Texans.\nThe Cardinals had three consecutive losing seasons under Green, and they have not had a winning season since 1998. General Manager Rod Graves indicated that the team underachieved this season under Green, finishing last in the National Football Conference West with a 5-11 record despite an offensive nucleus that featured wide receivers Anquan Boldin and Larry Fitzgerald, running back Edgerrin James and quarterback Matt Leinart.\n''We feel like we have a young, talented team, certainly capable of being a playoff contender,'' Graves said yesterday during a news conference.\nChow may have an inside track with the Cardinals because of his relationship with Leinart. When Leinart won the Heisman Trophy at Southern California, Chow was the offensive coordinator.\nMora's dismissal in Atlanta was expected. Last month, Mora embarrassed the Falcons when he was interviewed on a Seattle radio station and said it was his ''dream job'' to coach at the University of Washington, his alma mater. The Falcons faded late in the season for the second consecutive year, losing seven of their last nine games to finish 7-9. Although Atlanta reached the conference championship game during his first season, and his overall record was 26-22, Mora missed the playoffs for the second consecutive season.\nSaban has repeatedly denied that he is headed to Alabama, but when asked yesterday -- amid numerous news media reports that the Crimson Tide was about to make him a lucrative offer -- if he could guarantee that he would be Miami's coach next season, Saban did not guarantee anything.\n''I got a rule that I'm not talking about any of that stuff, and I'd appreciate the courtesy of not having to talk about it at this time,'' Saban said.\nCowher, 49, was expected to make a decision this month.\nVIKINGS RECEIVER ARRESTED -- Minnesota wide receiver Travis Taylor was arrested early yesterday outside a downtown Minneapolis nightclub, hours after the team's season-ending 41-21 loss to St. Louis.\nTaylor, 27, refused an officer's request that he get into a waiting limousine-bus as the police tried to disperse a large, unruly crowd so an ambulance could get through around 2:30 a.m., a police spokeswoman said. Taylor was not allowing the bus to leave and began pushing the officer, and the officer eventually used a Taser to subdue Taylor, the spokeswoman said.\nA free agent after this season, Taylor started all 16 games and led the Vikings with 57 receptions for 651 yards. (AP)\nMORGAN CLEARED TO PLAY -- Carolina Panthers middle linebacker Dan Morgan said yesterday that he had been cleared to return next season despite multiple concussions.\nMorgan sustained at least the fifth concussion of his career in the season opener against Atlanta and missed the rest of the season, putting his playing career in jeopardy.

1815990	Play-Callers With Different Styles Lead Teams to the Same Place	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E6DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	There is a perfectly good reason offensive coordinators are rarely allowed out in public: they are far too valuable locked in their dismal bunkers, cooking up game plans, to waste their time in public.\nYet sometimes the labors of the offensive coordinators become visible even to the civilians in the stands and the press box. Both the Jets and the Giants are in the playoffs next Sunday partly because their resident mad geniuses took almost opposite tacks last weekend.\nBrian Schottenheimer of the Jets likes to throw strange plays at the opponents, just to confuse them. (''I like to cause angst,'' Jets Coach Eric Mangini said yesterday with a beatific smile.) And Kevin Gilbride, newly appointed to plan the Giants' offense for Saturday night, restored order by letting Tiki Barber carry the ball early and often.\nLinking two offensive coordinators is a somewhat simplistic explanation for why the Jets will be playing at New England at 1 p.m. Sunday in a resumption of the great Bill Belichick-Mangini morality play, and the Giants will be playing at Philadelphia at 4:30 p.m.\nThere is never a single reason for anything in football, whose coaches quite legitimately cannot explain what happened on the field until they have reviewed the films. But the two New York teams, trying to outlast the pack on the final weekend of the regular season, pursued somewhat opposite paths.\nTom Coughlin, the coach of the slumping Giants, made what could only be seen as his own desperate pass, scuttling John Hufnagel in the week before the Washington game and turning over the offense to Gilbride, the quarterbacks coach, with whom Coughlin had worked in Jacksonville.\nGilbride channeled Manning toward running plays, a tactic Barber had been requesting for weeks as the Giants floundered. The result was that Barber set a club record with 234 rushing yards and prolonged his retirement by at least a week. Barber had apparently frosted some unimaginative football types by saying he was getting bored in midweek meetings, but listening to a coach and daydreaming at the same time seem like a sign of his high intelligence.\nGilbride seems capable of a change of pace himself. With the Giants facing a third-down-and-1 crisis late in the first half, the coaches sent in hulking Jared Lorenzen, who is conservatively listed at 275 pounds. Lorenzen, who had not played a down since joining the team in 2005, bulled for 2 yards to set up a field goal. Maybe there will be more innovation like that as Gilbride toils away in the sunless basement.\nThe Jets have not lacked for weird stuff since Schottenheimer joined the team this year. Under his watch, Brad Smith, who gained a total of more than 12,000 yards rushing and passing at Missouri, has become a versatile spare weapon, catching and running, and he's also a constant threat to pass. Smith already has 18 rushes for 103 yards and 9 receptions for 61 yards, in addition to a game-winning stint at quarterback in the preseason. Whenever he comes into a game, opponents shout out his No. 16, meaning they have been warned. This man is dangerous.\nFor some of us, offensive riffs by the likes of Smith, Refrigerator Perry, Mike Vrabel, Kordell Stewart and Antwaan Randle El almost make up for pro football's rather grinding predictability. Who will ever forget Bill Parcells's sending out Keyshawn Johnson, the Jets' rangy receiver, to play defensive center field against a last-gasp pass?\nOn Sunday, Schottenheimer's bag of tricks included a double reverse to Jerricho Cotchery that lost 3 yards, an end-around to Smith for 20 yards, and a direct snap that Smith took for 3 yards, just to keep the Raiders guessing.\nThis chicanery stems from the meeting last winter soon after Mangini, now 35, was appointed as Jets coach. He wanted a coach from the ''San Diego-Kansas City-St. Louis family,'' Mangini said, because those teams had a history of offensive flexibility. Schottenheimer also had the reputation as the imaginative son of the more conservative Marty Schottenheimer.\n''I liked that he's younger than me,'' Mangini said of his coordinator, now all of 33.\nMangini did not really know Schottenheimer until they began talking philosophy during the interview. Mangini said, ''So many people get caught up in 'the system,' '' but Schottenheimer preferred to tailor his offense to the makeup of the next opponent. This was the answer Mangini had wanted.\n''I enjoy seeing the script,'' Mangini said of the weekly game plan Schottenheimer devises.\nLaveranues Coles, the Jets' best receiver, was raving about Schottenheimer yesterday. ''The thing is, he allows you to have input,'' Coles said. ''If you see something, you can knock on his door and say, 'Coach, this could work.' '' Often enough, Coles said, the suggestion turns up in the game plan.\nThere is a potential downside to the weekly inventive game plans, said Pete Kendall, the Jets' thoughtful 11-year guard. ''I don't understand passing well enough'' to pass judgment on the plays, he said.\n''But it's hard for us,'' Kendall added, in response to a question about absorbing the game plan. ''The cadences, the rhythms. But as unsettling as it is to us, the more it is to the other guys.''\nGilbride consolidated. Schottenheimer expanded. Both New York teams play again Sunday. At the moment, buzzing noises of great mental activity are emanating from the two separate bunkers.\nSPORTS OF THE TIMES E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com
1815991	Cornerback For Broncos Is Killed In Shooting	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E6DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	About a month ago, the Denver Broncos starting cornerback Darrent Williams said he looked forward to returning to Fort Worth during the off-season to warn young people in his hometown about staying away from violence and drugs.\nWilliams never made it home. Early yesterday, hours after the Broncos were denied a berth in the N.F.L. playoffs by losing in overtime to the San Francisco 49ers, he was shot to death in downtown Denver when the limousine he was riding in was fired on from another vehicle, the police said. They declined to comment on whether any suspects were being questioned. Williams was 24.\nThe shooting occurred a few blocks from a nightclub where a group that included Williams had been in a dispute with another group, according to a police spokesman, Sonny Jackson. He said that Williams was not directly involved in the dispute and that it was not a physical confrontation.\nA man and a woman who were in the limousine with Williams were also shot; Jackson said their injuries were not serious.\nKenyon Martin, the injured star forward of the N.B.A.'s Denver Nuggets, told The Denver Post that Williams was among Broncos and Nuggets players at the club to celebrate New Year's Eve and also Martin's birthday. Martin said that he and several other Nuggets players left before midnight and that there had been no trouble at the club to that point.\nMark Warkentien, the Nuggets' vice president for basketball operations, told The Associated Press that the police spoke with him but asked him not to comment.\nWilliams, a second-year pro out of Oklahoma State, was riding in a stretch Hummer when the gunfire erupted just after 2 a.m., hitting three people in the limousine, according to the police.\nWilliams's agent, Jeff Griffin, told The Post that Williams was shot in the neck. He was pronounced dead at Denver Health Medical Center shortly after 2:30 a.m. An unidentified man, who the police said was not a Broncos player, was treated at a hospital and released. A woman who was shot, also unidentified, remained hospitalized but was expected to be released in a few days.\nJackson would not identify others in the limousine. Several Denver-area news outlets reported that Broncos wide receiver Javon Walker was among them.\nAs many as a dozen bullet holes were visible in the limousine, which veered into a snowbank, and one window was blown out. The police said they believed the shots came from a large white sport-utility vehicle with dark-tinted windows that pulled alongside the limousine.\n''We don't believe that it's random,'' Jackson said.\nJackson said that the police did not believe any shots were fired from the limousine and that they found no weapons inside it.\nWilliams, a right cornerback, had 86 tackles, 3 recovered fumbles and 4 interceptions this season, teaming with Champ Bailey for an outstanding cornerback tandem. Williams was the third N.F.L. player to be shot in the past six months.\nThe last active N.F.L. player to die was San Francisco's Thomas Herrion, who had a heart attack after an exhibition game in 2005. In July 2000, running back Fred Lane, the Carolina Panthers' career-leading rusher before his trade to the Indianapolis Colts two months earlier, was fatally shot at his home by his wife, who later pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\nDowntown Denver, its streets surrounded by mounds of plowed snow from recent storms, was largely quiet yesterday, but fans trickled to the site where Williams was shot. ''My heart doesn't break very easy, but when I got up and heard the news today, my heart fell and broke,'' said Cory Anderson, 25, who delivers medical supplies.\nThe Broncos players were off yesterday, but about 20 gathered at team headquarters to console one another, according to The Associated Press. Players will return to their headquarters today to clean out their lockers and begin the off-season.\n''All of us are devastated by this tragedy,'' the Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen, said in a statement. ''To lose a young player, and more important, a great young man such as Darrent Williams, is incomprehensible. To lose him in such a senseless manner as this is beyond words.''\nWilliams was an only child reared by his mother in a tough neighborhood in Fort Worth. In an interview with The Denver Post published Dec. 3, Williams said that from the time he was 8, he told people he would play in the N.F.L. But as a teenager, he said, he associated with the wrong people, including gang members. While in high school, he skipped classes so often that his coaches -- he was a three-sport star -- drove around looking for him.\n''I was running the streets, getting into trouble,'' Williams said. ''I was going down the wrong way for a while.''\nBut Williams said he began to change after hearing a preacher encourage parishioners to pray more. He went to Oklahoma State in part because it was closer to home than some of the other colleges that pursued him.\nHe was the Broncos' second-round draft pick in 2005 and was starting by the third game of his rookie season. He bought his mother a new house and a car, and he was about to release a CD under his own label with rap and rhythm-and-blues by artists from his old neighborhood, he told The Post.\nWilliams, who was not married, had a son and a daughter who live with their mother in Texas. In the interview, Williams said he and his children's mother got along well.\nHe said, ''I feel like I've got a better deal than a lot of people.''\nPRO FOOTBALL
1815992	Knicks Resolve to Get More Out of Curry in the New Year	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E6DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	On a bright, springlike afternoon in Northern California, the Knicks huddled and considered the latest changes forced upon them. They dribbled a new ball. They said goodbye, for now, to a starter. And they set about finding ways to pry that web of unfriendly hands and arms from Eddy Curry's face.\nThe new ball is actually the N.B.A.'s old leather ball, which replaces the synthetic ball the league used -- to the players' mass discontent -- for the past two months. The Knicks practiced with the leather ball Monday and will play their first game with it Tuesday night against the Sacramento Kings.\nThe goodbyes were for Steve Francis, the former starting guard, who has taken his balky right knee back to Houston, his off-season home and workout site. Francis is trying to strengthen the knee and figures to get more personal attention from the trainers he works with every summer. There is no timetable for his return, but it figures to be weeks, not months.\nThe Knicks' greatest challenge for the new year, however, is the same one they faced on opening night: how to get the most from Curry, their starting center and newly designated franchise player.\nCurry has produced some spectacular results -- a string of 20-point games, a number of double-doubles and some dominating performances. But his size and athleticism have been negated recently by double- and triple-teams, and the offense is sputtering as a result.\nThe Knicks have not broken the 90-point barrier in their last three regulation-length games, against the Los Angeles Clippers, the Phoenix Suns and the Philadelphia 76ers. Defending the Knicks has come down to a simple formula: send everyone at Curry and watch the Knicks crumble.\nWithout the injured Quentin Richardson, the Knicks lack a reliable shooter to keep defenses honest. And Curry, for all of his talent, is still learning how to cope with all of the attention.\n''It would help a lot if I knew exactly where to look once the double-team was coming,'' Curry said before the Knicks practiced at the Kings' training center. ''But this is all new to me. I'm learning on the fly, just trying to do the best that I can.''\nThis is Curry's sixth season, but his first as a team's No. 1 scoring option. Drafted out of high school, he missed certain big-man lessons, among them how to pass out of a double team. Although defenses occasionally doubled up on him in the past, Curry said this was by far the most attention he had received.\n''I think it's definitely a sign of respect,'' Curry said, adding wryly, ''It's definitely a pain.''\nTeams are no longer waiting for Curry to dribble, or even to catch the ball. They are often sending help while the ball is still on its way to the post. Asked what the strategy should be -- should he pass out of the post immediately, then repost and wait for the ball again? -- Curry smiled.\n''That's why I'm here today,'' he said. ''If you have the time, you want to see who's doubling, see what man he's coming off and see if you can get it to that man, because that's usually the guy that's open. But the way the teams are playing now, they're doubling me and then they're rotating back to that guy. And so then the other guy cross court is open, and I was never known as a great passer.''\nIndeed, Curry is averaging just 0.7 assists a game despite being a focal point of the offense. He has 23 assists in 33 games, one more than Renaldo Balkman, who has played less than half as many minutes as Curry.\nPassing is a skill that will improve with practice, but mostly through game experience. Curry has been receiving nonstop advice from the assistant coaches Mark Aguirre and Herb Williams, as well as from Coach Isiah Thomas.\n''The great players never play against single coverage,'' Thomas said. ''Their whole career, they're double-teamed. And it seems like Eddy, that's the way he's going to be playing for the next eight, nine years, or however long he's in the league.''\nCurry's job will become easier when Richardson returns from his back injury, possibly later this week, and when Nate Robinson returns next week from his suspension. They have been the Knicks' two most reliable 3-point shooters.\n''This is a problem that we should have solved by March or April,'' Thomas said. ''He should be able to look people in the eye and give the other guys layups once we can get the proper spacing and everything out on the floor.''\nBut can a poor-passing big man become a good one?\n''He'll never be Bill Walton, or even Kareem, in terms of being able to pass the ball,'' Thomas said. ''But he can become just as effective as any of the other bigs passing the ball who get double-teamed.''\nREBOUNDS\nQuentin Richardson did some running, dribbling and shooting Monday, but Isiah Thomas said he would not play Tuesday night. Players were happy to see the old leather ball on the racks, though it figures to take some adjusting after playing two months with the synthetic ball. Thomas said he gave Steve Francis permission to rehabilitate his knee in Houston. ''They can give him more intensive treatment with somebody who understands his body a little bit better,'' Thomas said. There is no timetable for Francis to return, but Thomas said, ''I don't think this is serious enough to keep him out.''\nBASKETBALL
1815993	Wal-Mart Puts Some Muscle Behind Power-Sipping Bulbs	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E6DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	As a way to cut energy use, it could not be simpler. Unscrew a light bulb that uses a lot of electricity and replace it with one that uses much less.\nWhile it sounds like a promising idea, it turns out that the long-lasting, swirl-shaped light bulbs known as compact fluorescent lamps are to the nation's energy problem what vegetables are to its obesity epidemic: a near perfect answer, if only Americans could be persuaded to swallow them.\nBut now Wal-Mart Stores, the giant discount retailer, is determined to push them into at least 100 million homes. And its ambitions extend even further, spurred by a sweeping commitment from its chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., to reduce energy use across the country, a move that could also improve Wal-Mart's appeal to the more affluent consumers the chain must win over to keep growing in the United States.\n''The environment,'' Mr. Scott said, ''is begging for the Wal-Mart business model.''\nIt is the environmental movement's dream: America's biggest company, legendary for its salesmanship and influence with suppliers, encouraging 200 million shoppers to save energy.\nFor all its power in retailing, though, Wal-Mart is meeting plenty of resistance -- from light-bulb makers, competitors and consumers. To help turn the tide, it is even reaching out to unlikely partners like Google, Home Depot and Hollywood.\nA compact fluorescent has clear advantages over the widely used incandescent light -- it uses 75 percent less electricity, lasts 10 times longer, produces 450 pounds fewer greenhouse gases from power plants and saves consumers $30 over the life of each bulb. But it is eight times as expensive as a traditional bulb, gives off a harsher light and has a peculiar appearance.\nAs a result, the bulbs have languished on store shelves for a quarter century; only 6 percent of households use the bulbs today.\nWhich is what makes Wal-Mart's goal so wildly ambitious. If it succeeds in selling 100 million compact fluorescent bulbs a year by 2008, total sales of the bulbs in the United States would increase by 50 percent, saving Americans $3 billion in electricity costs and avoiding the need to build additional power plants for the equivalent of 450,000 new homes.\nThat would send shockwaves -- some intended, others not -- across the lighting industry. Because compact fluorescent bulbs last up to eight years, giant manufacturers, like General Electric and Osram Sylvania, would sell far fewer lights. Because the bulbs are made in Asia, some American manufacturing jobs could be lost. And because the bulbs contain mercury, there is a risk of pollution when millions of consumers throw them away.\nMichael B. Petras, vice president of lighting at G.E., concedes that ''the economics are better with incandescent bulbs.''\nAll that has only spurred Wal-Mart to redouble its efforts -- and, in typical fashion, it is asking those who may be hurt by the change to help achieve it.\nDuring an extraordinary meeting in Las Vegas in early October, competing bulb makers, academics, environmentalists and government officials met to ponder, at times uncomfortably, how Wal-Mart could sell more of the fluorescent lights.\nThe proposals discussed at what Wal-Mart dubbed the ''light bulb summit'' ranged from the practical (advertise the bulbs on the back of a Coke 12-pack) to the quixotic (create a tax on incandescent bulbs to make them more expensive).\nSelling 100 million bulbs ''is not a slam dunk by any stretch of the imagination,'' Stephen Goldmacher, an executive at Royal Philips, the Dutch company that is one of the world's largest light-bulb makers, told the group. ''If this were easy, it would have happened already.''\nThe attendees did not need to look far for evidence. Wal-Mart had asked the owners of the Mirage Hotel and Casino, where the conference was held, to commit to using the energy saving bulbs in its guest rooms in time for the meeting. The hotel politely declined.\nIt is not alone. Compact fluorescent bulbs, introduced in the United States with much fanfare in 1979 by Philips just as the nation's second energy crisis of the decade was getting under way, have never captured the public imagination.\nThe new bulbs -- lighted by sparking an efficient chemical reaction, rather than heating a metal filament -- were ungainly, took several seconds to light up and often did not fit into traditional light fixtures.\nSince then, refinements have made them far more convenient to use, reducing their size and price as well. But Wal-Mart sold only 40 million in 2005, compared with about 350 million incandescent bulbs, according to people briefed on the figures.\nAnd it would have stayed that way unless Wal-Mart decided to go green. More than a year ago, Mr. Scott, the company's chief executive, began reaching out to some of environmental groups, telling them that Wal-Mart, long regarded as an environmental offender, wanted to become a leader on issues like fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions.\nMr. Scott viewed such a move as a way to use Wal-Mart's influence to improve the environment, cut costs and, of course, burnish the company's bruised image. In September 2005, Mr. Scott and Andy Ruben, Wal-Mart's vice president for strategy and sustainability, drove 6,000 feet to the Mount Washington Observatory in New Hampshire with Steve Hamburg, an environmental studies professor at Brown University, and Fred Krupp, the president of the advocacy group Environmental Defense.\nAt the summit, where scientists measure climate change 24 hours a day, the men discussed global warming, acid rain, the hole in the ozone layer and what Wal-Mart could do about them.\n''You need to look at what is being sold on the shelf,'' Mr. Hamburg recalled telling Mr. Scott over a dinner of turkey and mashed potatoes. He began talking excitedly about compact fluorescent bulbs. ''Very few products,'' he said, ''are such a clear winner'' for consumers and the environment.\nSoon after returning from the trip, Wal-Mart publicly embraced the bulbs with the zealotry of a convert. In meetings with suppliers, buyers for the chain laid out their plans: lower prices, expanding the shelf space dedicated to them and heavily promoting the technology.\nLight-bulb manufacturers, who sell millions of incandescent lights at Wal-Mart, immediately expressed reservations. In a December 2005 meeting with executives from General Electric, Wal-Mart's largest bulb supplier, ''the message from G.E. was, 'Don't go too fast. We have all these plants that produce traditional bulbs,' '' said one person involved with the issue, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of an agreement not to speak publicly about the negotiations.\nThe response from the Wal-Mart buyer was blunt, this person said. ''We are going there,'' the buyer said. ''You decide if you are coming with us.''\nIn the end, as Wal-Mart suppliers generally do, the bulb makers decided to come with the company.\nPhilips, despite protests from packaging designers, agreed to change the name of its compact fluorescent bulbs from ''Marathon'' to ''energy saver.'' To keep up with swelling orders from the chain, Osram Sylvania took to flying entire planeloads of compact fluorescent bulbs from Asia to the United States.\n''When Wal-Mart sets its mind to something with a narrow objective like that, they are going to make it happen,'' said Jim Jubb, vice president for consumer product sales at Sylvania.\nAt the same time that it pressured suppliers, Wal-Mart began testing ways to better market the bulbs. In the past, Wal-Mart had sold them on the bottom shelf of the lighting aisle, so that shoppers had to bend down. In tests that started in February, it gave the lights prime real estate at eye level. Sales soared.\nTo show customers how versatile the bulbs could be, Wal-Mart began displaying them inside the lamps and hanging fans for sale in its stores. Sales nudged up further.\nTo explain the benefits of the energy-efficient bulbs, the retailer placed an education display case at the end of the aisle, where it occupied four feet of valuable selling space -- an extravagance at Wal-Mart. Sales climbed even higher.\nIn August 2006, the chain sold 3.94 million, nearly twice the 1.65 million it sold in August 2005, according to a person briefed on the numbers.\nBut to reach 100 million, Wal-Mart has to do much more -- and that, executives concede, is where the biggest challenges rest. In the fall, the company began reaching out to competing retailers, Internet companies and even filmmakers.\nThe goal was to turn its sales campaign into a broader cultural movement.\nOne proposal, headed by Lawrence Bender, who produced Al Gore's 2006 documentary, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' is to create a Web site that would track sales of compact fluorescent bulbs at major retailers like Walgreen's and Target. The result would be a real-time map, with data collected by a third party, showing how much Americans have saved by using the energy-efficient bulbs.\nMr. Ruben said such a map ''helps consumers see this as something bigger than buying a bulb.''\nAt the same time, Google and Yahoo are in talks with Wal-Mart about how to use their search engines to promote the bulbs.\nBut Home Depot and Lowe's balked at the idea of cooperating with their larger rival. ''We don't think we need an organization like that to sell more CFLs,'' said Ron Jarvis, the vice president of environmental innovation at Home Depot, using the bulb's industry nickname.\nThen there is the mercury inside the bulbs, a problem Wal-Mart is working with the federal government and environmental groups to resolve, possibly by collecting the bulbs at its stores or off-site locations for recycling.\nIn the end, though, the biggest obstacle to overcome is America's love affair with cheap, familiar-looking incandescent bulbs -- a habit 130 years in the making.\nFor that to turn around, Wal-Mart will have to persuade its traditional consumers that it is worth paying a bit more at the checkout counter to save a significant amount money down the line, a seemingly simple task that few companies ever accomplish. It is particularly difficult at a retailer that has long emphasized ''always low prices.''\n''It has taken the American public forever to grasp this,'' said Charlie Jerabek, the chief executive of Sylvania.\nHelen Capone encapsulates the challenge. Ms. Capone, 68, said she ''curses the energy company every month'' because of her electricity bill and loves the five-year-old, trouble-free compact fluorescent bulb in her attic. But she won't switch to the energy-saving bulbs in the rest of her house in Secaucus, N.J. ''They are not the prettiest things in the world,'' she said, surveying the bulbs at a Wal-Mart.\nThat has put Wal-Mart in the strange position of racing ahead of its customers and coaxing them, bulb by bulb, toward energy conservation.\n''We start with the premise,'' Mr. Ruben, ''that customers make good choices.''\nArticles in this series are examining the ways in which the world is, and is not, moving toward a more energy-efficient, environmentally benign future. Previous articles are at nytimes.com/energychallenge. ONLINE: A video discussion with more detail about energy-efficient light bulbs: nytimes.com/business\nThe Energy Challenge\nCorrection: January 9, 2007, Tuesday A front-page article last Tuesday about Wal-Mart's struggle to market a long-lasting, energy-saving light bulb known as a compact fluorescent lamp misstated the time period in which the retailer sold 40 million of the bulbs compared with about 350 million incandescent bulbs. It was from August 2005 to August 2006 -- not in 2005.\nCorrection: January 13, 2007, Saturday A chart on Jan. 2 with the continuation of a front-page article about Wal-Mart's struggle to market an energy-saving light bulb known as a compact fluorescent lamp referred incompletely to mercury emissions in comparing two light bulbs. The emissions -- 2.4 milligrams from the fluorescent lamp and 10 milligrams for an incandescent bulb -- occur at a coal-powered plant generating the electricity needed for the bulbs. The bulbs themselves do not emit mercury.
1815994	Lock the Library! Rowdy Students Are Taking Over	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E6DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Every afternoon at Maplewood Middle School's final bell, dozens of students pour across Baker Street to the public library. Some study quietly.\nOthers, library officials say, fight, urinate on the bathroom floor, scrawl graffiti on the walls, talk back to librarians or refuse to leave when asked. One recently threatened to burn down the branch library. Librarians call the police, sometimes twice a day.\nAs a result, starting on Jan. 16, the Maplewood Memorial Library will be closing its two buildings on weekdays from 2:45 to 5 p.m., until further notice.\nAn institution that, like many nationwide, strives to attract young people, even offering beading and cartooning classes, will soon be shutting them out, along with the rest of the public, at one of the busiest parts of its day.\nLibrary employees will still be on the job, working at tasks like paperwork, filing, and answering calls and online questions.\n''They almost knocked me down, and they run in and out,'' said Lila Silverman, a Maplewood resident who takes her grandchildren to the library's children's room but called the front of the library ''a disaster area'' after school. ''I do try to avoid those hours.''\nThis comfortable Essex County suburb of 23,000 residents, still proud of its 2002 mention in Money magazine on a list of ''Best Places to Live,'' is no seedy outpost of urban violence. But its library officials, like many across the country, have grown frustrated by middle schoolers' mix of pent-up energy, hormones and nascent independence.\nIncreasingly, librarians are asking: What part of ''Shh!'' don't you understand?\nAbout a year ago, the Wickliffe, Ohio, library banned children under 14 during after-school hours unless they were accompanied by adults. An Illinois library adopted a ''three strikes, you're out'' rule, suspending library privileges for repeat offenders. And many libraries are adding security guards specifically for the after-school hours.\nIn Euclid, Ohio, the library pumps classical music into its lobby, bathrooms and front entry to calm patrons, including those from the nearby high school.\nA backlash against such measures has also begun: A middle school in Jefferson Parish, La., that requires a daily permission slip for students to use the local public library after school was threatened with a lawsuit last month by the American Civil Liberties Union.\nLibrarians and other experts say the growing conflicts are the result of an increase in the number of latchkey children, a decrease in civility among young people and a dearth of ''third places'' -- neither home nor school -- where kids can be kids.\n''We don't consider the world as safe a place as it used to be, and we don't encourage children to run around, hang around and be free,'' said Judy Nelson, president of the Young Adult Library Services Association, part of the American Library Association. ''So you have parents telling their kids that the library is a good place to go.''\nRowland Bennett, who served as the director of the Maplewood Memorial Library for 30 years and is now president of the local school board, said libraries had become ''the child care center by necessity.''\nLinda W. Braun, a librarian and professor who has written four books about teenagers' use of libraries, said the students want only to be treated like everybody else.\n''If there are little kids making noise, it's cute, and they can run around, it's O.K.,'' Ms. Braun said of standard library operating procedure. ''Or if seniors with hearing difficulties are talking loudly, that's accepted. But a teen who might talk loudly for a minute or two gets in trouble.''\nShe added: ''The parents don't want them, the library doesn't want them, so they act out.''\nThat leaves librarians doing a job they did not sign up for: baby-sitting for kids old enough to baby-sit.\nThe Maplewood library has created a gallery space for young people's artwork, put on an anime film festival and formed a Teen Advisory Group that attracted 30 youngsters for a recent pizza party.\nBut problems persisted.\nIn consultation with a lawyer, the library board came up with behavior guidelines in May 2005 that prohibited activities like ''hairdressing or grooming of another person'' and ''refusal to leave the building.'' The policy includes some politely precise language common to those who speak softly from behind a reference desk: ''If a patron seems to be placing a staff member in the position of providing a nonlibrary-related function, the staff member may bring the interaction to a prompt conclusion.''\nBut library officials felt that a bigger stick was needed. Last week, the board posted a notice on its Web site and library doors saying it had ''struggled with this problem for over 10 years'' and voted ''with great reluctance'' on Dec. 20 to close after school.\n''Having as many as 50 young people with nothing to do creates an untenable situation,'' read the note, which pointed out that many students did not use library resources but simply socialized in the building. ''It interferes with patrons of all ages who want to use the library and with the staff members who are there to serve them. The library can no longer deal with large numbers of students who come after school and wait, sometimes into the late evening, to be picked up.''\nThe decision has not been popular in town. In a posting on Maplewoodonline.com, the community's Internet bulletin board, one resident, Joan Crystal, said an alternative needed to be developed before closing the library. ''I also think it improper to close the library during hours when adults, older students and M.M.S. students find it most convenient to use the library,'' she wrote.\nDavid Huemer, who represents the Maplewood Township Committee on the library board, said he would like to see the current police station, which is being retired in favor of a new one, converted to a youth center.\n''What we have to do now is build some long-overdue facilities and fund some programs so kids can have alternatives to hanging out,'' he said. ''To the extent that the vote of the library board is going to wake people up and get them to do something about kids from sixth grade to high school, that's a good thing.''\nAbout eight years ago, the library in nearby Irvington, N.J., struggling with similar problems, was shuttered for an hour each afternoon. But it was only for three days, until the students managed to settle down, officials said.\nVeronica Morton, who was returning a Magic School Bus book to the Maplewood library the other day with her 8-year-old daughter, Alexandra, said she had become a ''shush mommy'' after watching librarians struggle to ''get kids to calm down.''\nOutside the library, students who use it gave the new hours two thumbs down, way down.\n''Kids will get into real mischievous activities'' with the library closed, warned one teenager, Jonathan Brock, a student at the district's alternative high school program.\n''I'm kind of annoyed,'' said David Carliner, a middle schooler who was rushing up the library steps ahead of his father. ''It closes right when my school gets out, so I can't check out any books.''
1815995	At U.S.C., No Title but Plenty to Celebrate	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE6DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Before Southern California defeated Michigan, 32-18, in the Rose Bowl on Monday, there were questions whether Trojans quarterback John David Booty deserved to return as the starter next season.\nAfter he shredded the Wolverines for 391 yards and 4 touchdowns, the U.S.C. supporters who doubted Booty may wonder if he will contend in 2007 to become the fourth U.S.C. player and third quarterback to win the Heisman Trophy this decade.\n''I don't listen or mind what anybody says, I don't pay any attention,'' said Booty, who completed 27 of 45 passes.\nThe fortunes of Booty and the Trojans next season could depend on the return of Dwayne Jarrett, the junior split end who caught two touchdown passes Monday and had 11 receptions for 205 yards. Jarrett is considering declaring himself eligible for the N.F.L. draft.\n''I'm going to hate it,'' Booty said, referring to the possible departure of Jarrett. ''But after tonight's performance, it's going to be hard to keep him.''\nJarrett's most significant play was a 62-yard scoring reception early in the fourth quarter that gave the Trojans a 25-11 lead and stifled a Michigan comeback. The play had all the elements that cause fans to like and dislike stars who have a high regard for themselves.\nOn a third and 10, after splitting two defensive backs and catching Booty's pass on the Michigan 28, Jarrett cut toward the left sideline, then slowed and jogged to the end zone, just out of the reach of Willis Barringer, the Michigan safety.\nAs he crossed the goal line, Jarrett pointed to Barringer, who responded with a late hit, for which he was penalized. Jarrett later said that he feared that he, too, might be penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct.\nBut that did not stop him from pushing the football at Barringer after another catch a few minutes later.\n''He was out there talking the whole game, woofing at the mouth,'' Jarrett said of Barringer. ''All fun. All love.''\nMore seriously, of the 62-yard play, Jarrett said, ''When we did that, we kind of broke their backs a little bit.'' Jarrett said the Michigan defensive backs ''had some weaknesses you could definitely exploit.''\nAs to whether he will remain in college, Jarrett said he would discuss it with his family and decide by the Jan. 15 draft entry deadline. ''It's not written in stone,'' he said. He also said, more than once, ''I had a great night.''\nIt was not so great for Mike Hart, the Michigan tailback, who gained only 47 yards on 17 carries, or Chad Henne, the Michigan quarterback, who passed for 309 yards and 2 touchdowns but also turned the ball over on a fumble and an interception.\nIn addition, with a chance to put his team ahead early in the second quarter, and with receiver Adrian Arrington open in the U.S.C. end zone, Henne threw a pass that hit the helmet of Trojans defensive back Mozique McCurtis, who was a stride behind the receiver.\nHenne was sacked five times, including three times on the same series.\n''Protection broke down at times,'' Henne said. ''We didn't handle their front seven. We just played poor. Their speed overcame ours.''\nHart, who averaged 126.2 yards a game during the regular season, said: ''U.S.C. today showed they belonged in the national championship. We didn't.''\nHe said his running was unsuccessful -- his longest carry was 11 yards -- because ''their defensive line got a lot of penetration.''\nNo game in college football's postseason has more historical resonance than the Rose Bowl, and Monday's result maintained two of its long-standing hallmarks. No team has won this game more than the Trojans, who raised their Rose Bowl record to 22-9 since their first appearance in 1930.\nAnd no team has lost this game more than the Wolverines, who fell to 8-12 since their first trip here in 1902.\nIt was Michigan's fourth consecutive defeat in postseason play, three of them here. LaMarr Woodley, Michigan's outstanding defensive end, said, ''This is something that will stick with you for the rest of your life.''\nBoth teams finished 11-2. Both had hoped to play in the Bowl Championship Series title game next Monday, but both were eliminated in the final game of the regular season, the Trojans with a loss to U.C.L.A, the Wolverines when they were defeated by Ohio State, which will play Florida for the national championship.\nAfter a 3-3 tie at halftime, the first big break of the second half came when Henne threw his interception after a play-action handoff fake on a screen pass attempt. He retreated under pressure and threw short, up the middle.\nThe ball landed in the arms of Lawrence Jackson, a U.S.C. defensive end, at the Wolverines' 38.\nThe Trojans struck quickly with a 25-yard reception by Jarrett on a post pattern that gave them a first down at the 2, followed by Booty's pass to Chris McFoy in the end zone for a 10-3 lead with 8 minutes 43 seconds remaining in the third quarter.\nPregame speculation suggested neither team would care too much about this game because it amounted to a consolation match.\nWhen asked about that after the game, Michigan Coach Lloyd Carr winced and said of his players: ''It mattered a lot. They're tremendously disappointed, as disappointed as you can be.''\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL

The night game, however, was the best of the bunch. In the Fiesta Bowl, Oklahoma rallied from an 18-point deficit and went ahead, but Boise State tied the score on a hook-and-lateral play with seven seconds left in regulation. In overtime, Oklahoma scored first, but Boise State responded with trick plays that produced a touchdown and 2-point conversion to win, 43-42, and cap a 13-0 season.\nJoe Paterno watched from the press box as Penn State won the Outback Bowl.

Quarterback Jared Zabransky handed the ball behind his back to tailback Ian Johnson, who ran in untouched, completing one of the wildest and most important upsets in college football history.\nBoise State squandered an 18-point second-half lead and appeared destined to lose when Zabransky threw an interception to Oklahoma cornerback Marcus Walker that was returned 33 yards for a touchdown with 1 minute 2 seconds remaining in the game.\nThat gave Oklahoma a 35-28 lead, which appeared destined to stand until Boise State reached into its bag of tricks on a last-ditch play at the end of regulation.\nZabransky hit Drisan James over the middle for a 15-yard gain, and James flipped the ball to Jerard Rabb, who then ran the ball 40 yards for a touchdown with seven seconds remaining in regulation.\nThe play will go down in college football lore as the linchpin play in an epic game.\nThe trickery did not end for Boise State in overtime. Facing a fourth-and-2, the Broncos lined up wide receiver Vinny Perretta at quarterback, and he completed a pass to tight end Derek Schouman for a 5-yard touchdown. A conversion kick could have tied the score, but Boise State Coach Chris Petersen decided to go for 2. After Oklahoma called a timeout, the Broncos executed a textbook Statue of Liberty play to seal the improbable victory.\nThe win will shake the core of the college football establishment, as Oklahoma of the Big 12 entered the game heavily favored. The Broncos, who famously play their games on a blue turf field, won the biggest game in their program's history by defeating one of college football's blue bloods.\nIn doing so, Boise State showed that the best team from outside college football's six power conferences could play with the champion from a conference like the Big 12.\nIn the first year of the B.C.S.'s double-hosting format, which was founded in part to allow access to teams outside the power conferences a better chance at reaching the top-tier bowl games, the Broncos more than justified the decision.\nThanks to four critical turnovers by Oklahoma quarterback Paul Thompson, Oklahoma was playing from behind all night. Boise was more timely than dominant, as it used a series of big plays and exploited turnovers to compensate for its size and athleticism disadvantages.\nThe Broncos were able to slow down the star tailback Adrian Peterson, who returned from a seven game absence with a broken collarbone and rushed for 77 yards on 20 carries in what's expected to be his final collegiate game. Peterson's biggest run of the night came in the first overtime when he ran the ball in from 25 yards out on the first play.\nBut even Peterson's star power didn't matter.\nIt's only fitting that N.C.A.A. basketball upstart George Mason took out a full-page ad in The Idaho Statesman this week, one David sending good luck wishes from two time zones away. Much like Mason's stunning run to the Final Four last March was viewed as a victory for the little guy in college basketball, Boise's victory could be seen the same way for football.\nIt will be long lost in history that the Broncos actually entered the game ranked No. 8, two spots higher than an Oklahoma team that battled attrition, injuries and questionable officiating in a trying season.\nAll that will be remembered is that a team from Boise that's been a Division I-A football member for 11 years topped a program that's won seven national championships and produced 142 all-Americans.\nBoise pulled out the victory after Oklahoma launched a stunning comeback. The Sooners tied the game at 28 1:26 remaining after Thompson completed a 2-point conversion on O.U.'s third attempt, as penalties marred the other two.\nThat was just one wild sequence in a frenetic finish that will long live in the lore of underdogs and trickery in college football.\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL
1815998	Paterno Sits Out Penn State Victory	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E5DE1730F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Joe Paterno stepped gingerly onto the sideline at Raymond James Stadium on Monday morning, his cane firmly in hand as a Penn State staffer, security guards and cameras hovered. It was a significant milestone in Paterno's recovery from a broken left shin and torn knee ligaments, injuries sustained Nov. 4 when he was run over on the sideline by two players during a game at Wisconsin. Finally, Paterno was back on the field.\nHe did not stay long. Paterno, who turned 80 on Dec. 21, stood for eight minutes before slowly making his way back to the tunnel during pregame warm-ups and then up to the press box. He was still too fragile and immobile to risk another hit while coaching the Nittany Lions against Tennessee in the Outback Bowl.\nInstead, Paterno watched from above, along with a crowd of 65,601, as a defensive battle turned on an 88-yard fumble return by Penn State cornerback Tony Davis with 10 minutes 1 second remaining. The touchdown broke a tie and lifted the Nittany Lions to a 20-10 victory against No. 17 Tennessee. It was the 22nd bowl victory for Paterno, whose team finished 9-4.\nRunning back Tony Hunt was named the game's most valuable player after gaining 158 yards on 31 carries to move into second place on Penn State's career rushing list with 3,320 yards. Hunt, a senior, finished between Curt Warner (3,398) and Blair Thomas (3,301).\nPaterno was happy with the outcome, but he did not seem to enjoy his perch.\nAfter having surgery Nov. 5, he missed his first game since 1977 when he stayed home for Penn State's victory against Temple on Nov. 11. A week later, he watched from the press box as the Nittany Lions defeated Michigan State to close the regular season.\nPaterno had hoped he would be back on the sideline for Penn State's bowl game. But he opted against it after testing the rain-soaked field during pregame warm-ups, the first time in 33 bowl games he was not on the field for Penn State.\n''It was getting a little muddy, and I was a little bit nervous with just that one thing moving around in case it slipped,'' he said of the cane, which was attached to his right arm with a brace. ''And then I got worried about whether I would be able to stand on it for over three hours.\n''I have a great staff. They've been with me a long time and they need me like they need a hole in the head.''\nIt was Paterno and his assistants who decided the team needed quarterback Anthony Morelli to take pressure off Hunt and the running game if the Nittany Lions were to beat Tennessee (9-4). Morelli, a junior who had an uneven season, came through against the Volunteers. He was 14 of 25 for 197 yards and a touchdown.\n''I just thought he grew up today in a lot of different ways,'' Paterno said.\nMorelli had put Penn State ahead, 10-3, with 3:30 to go in the second quarter on a 2-yard touchdown pass to Andrew Quarless. Tennessee responded with a 42-yard touchdown run by LaMarcus Coker to tie the score.\nThe third quarter was scoreless as the defenses stiffened. But it appeared Tennessee would break through in the fourth quarter when quarterback Erik Ainge, a nephew of the Boston Celtics executive Danny Ainge, connected with tight end Chris Brown on a 53-yard reception that gave the Volunteers a first down at the Penn State 14. Ainge was 25 of 37 for 267 yards and an interception.\nIt was on the next play that linebacker Sean Lee appeared to punch the ball out of the arms of Tennessee running back Arian Foster. Davis picked up the ball and returned it 88 yards down the sideline for a touchdown with 10:01 remaining.\nDavis said the coaching staff had made the defensive backs practice picking up fumbles during workouts Saturday.\n''I was laughing,'' Davis said. ''I was like, this isn't going to happen.''\nBut when it did, Davis didn't hesitate. Instead of jumping on the ball, he scooped it up.\n''I just saw the sideline and all grass,'' he said.\nDavis and the Nittany Lions had to wait out a review that confirmed the fumble occurred before Foster's knees touched the ground. It was all Penn State needed, although the Nittany Lions added a 22-yard field goal by Kevin Kelly with 3:29 remaining.\nMorelli said the victory would give Penn State momentum through the off-season and confidence to contend for a national title next season. Asked if he expected Paterno to be back on the sideline watching it happen, Morelli said, ''Yeah, I definitely do.''\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL

Though the collection itself is not in danger and will be placed in the Victoria and Albert collections center, the questions of when and where it will again be on display remain open.\nThe impending closing has caused a protest and the creation of a group called Guardians of the Theater Museum, which is using its Web site (theatremuseumguardians.org.uk) to solicit names for an online petition to save the museum.

1816002	Not the Case	2007-01-02	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E2DD1130F931A35752C0A9619C8B63	Even among those who opposed the Iraq war from the start, there was always hope that bringing Saddam Hussein to justice would be a saving grace of the entire misbegotten enterprise. Now it seems that even this comfort will be denied. Far from healing old wounds, as some suggested it would, his conviction by the Iraqi special tribunal has exerted little effect on the deepening civil conflict between Shiites and Sunnis. The often circuslike atmosphere of the trial, as well as the murder of three defense lawyers, led groups like Human Rights Watch to condemn the tribunal as flawed and illegitimate. And the charge for which Saddam Hussein received the death penalty did not include his most heinous acts. His execution must still remind the world of the horror of the atrocities he committed while in power. But unfortunately, the disarray of the legal process calls greater attention to the failings of the United States, the Iraqis and the international community in dealing with all that has come after.\nSince its inception, the tribunal has been haunted by a fundamental problem that bedevils the new Iraqi government more generally: the nature and origin of its authority. That the Iraqi dictator deserved to be punished was never in question. But from what source did the tribunal, which was established under U.S. occupation and then affirmed by the sovereign Iraqi government, derive the right to do so? This was not an academic question. Saddam Hussein was found guilty and sentenced to hang for sending 148 men and boys to their deaths in the aftermath of an attempted assassination against him in the Shiite town of Dujail in 1982. Under Iraqi law at the time, the president was immune from prosecution. In order to satisfy the rule of law - and to avoid the appearance of victor's justice - the tribunal needed to be able to explain its basis for applying the law that was used to find him guilty.\nIn part, the tribunal sought to draw legitimacy from international law. The court found Saddam Hussein guilty not of ordinary murder but of ''crimes against humanity,'' a grand-sounding, internationally recognized charge with intuitive moral force. When the phrase ''crimes against humanity'' was used at the Nuremberg trials in 1945, the convening nations did not bother to explain what gave them the right to define and punish such crimes. It was presumed self-evident that certain actions were so terrible that they must be treated as illegal, even if they might have been permissible under Nazi German law when they took place. The so-called Rome Statute, which created the International Criminal Court in The Hague in 2002, specifically defined crimes against humanity in terms drawn from the Nuremberg charter, and the definition used by the Iraqi special tribunal was copied from there.\nYet it is hard to believe that the Iraqi tribunal could convincingly claim its authority from the international community. Like the United States, Iraq has not ratified the Rome Statute. Indeed, the Iraqi tribunal explicitly avoided submitting itself to international standards so that it would be able to apply the death penalty, which most of the international community rejects. This resulted in near complete withdrawal of international cooperation in the investigation of Saddam Hussein's crimes and the trial itself, and the tribunal lost some of the perception of fairness that would have come from broader international participation.\nSo where, if anywhere, did the Iraqi tribunal get the right to punish Saddam Hussein for crimes against humanity? Sovereign nations like Iraq can, of course, punish whatever crimes they choose, and can change or abrogate their own earlier laws to do it. But there is something unsatisfying about offering this as an account, for it diminishes the tribunal's credible claim that the Iraqi dictator's actions reverberated worldwide, implicating not just Iraq but all of humanity. There must be some deeper source of law, apart from treaties or the dictates of the United Nations Security Council, that bans the systematic killing of innocents.\nThe most persuasive answer is that a law prohibiting crimes against humanity derives its authority from the inherent moral responsibility that lies with whoever has the capacity to punish truly heinous deeds. To be sure, in some cases the international community will bear that responsibility. In the case of Iraq, though, the international community was not in a position to act, not only because of the question of the death penalty but also because many of its members denied the legality of the invasion. Responsibility rested with the powers that actually held Saddam Hussein within their grasp. Their right - and their duty - was to bring him to justice.\nBy these lights, the decision to charge Saddam Hussein with crimes against humanity was morally and legally justified. Nevertheless, the process fell short of what is needed to invoke the transcendent norms of universal justice. This was a profound failure. As with the other shortcomings of Iraq's government, many players were at fault here: the Americans for failing to provide security for the Iraqis, including the defense team; the Iraqis for failing to get the trial - or the country - to run smoothly; the international community for sanctimoniously disengaging.\nBut the fact that blame is to be shared does not mitigate the tragedy of this missed opportunity.\nTHE WAY WE LIVE NOW

For many years, President of CBS who risked contempt of Congress for the freedom of the television press. In 1971, a CBS News program Selling of the Pentagon exposed an unauthorized Pentagon public relations campaign for the Vietnam War. A Congressional Committee subpoenaed Stanton to produce program outtakes for their investigation of CBS News editorial judgment. President Nixon backed the Committee. As journalists know, such government hearings can deter reporting of news to inform the public, particularly about government misconduct. They also scare away news sources. Stanton appeared but would not produce material nor testify about news judgments, asserting the First Amendment. The Committee moved for contempt of Congress to jail Stanton, fine CBS and threaten its broadcast licenses. Journalists, stations, newspapers, NBC and other broadcasters rallied to Stanton. Minority Leader Gerald Ford led Republicans to join those Democratic members who no longer supported their Committee. The vote for contempt failed. Television news gained its freedom from such Congressional hearings. We all are beneficiaries of Stanton's courage and his fight for First Amendment protection for television news. Corydon B.

1816044	From the Stage to the Movie Screen, Seeing the Dancer in a Different Light	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E4DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	In the very best of this year's Dance on Camera offerings, there is a sense of looking back. Documentaries celebrate artists who have transformed the field; stage adaptations preserve treasured productions for the long haul; and stylistic experiments show the way directors radically changed the approach of filming dance.\nBeginning tonight, the Dance on Camera Festival, presented by Dance Films Association and the Film Society of Lincoln Center, will once again turn the Walter Reade Theater into a showplace for bodies in motion. Now in its 35th year, the festival is traditionally difficult to negotiate, mainly because of its immensity. This time around, more than 30 films are packaged in 15 programs, which cheerfully conclude on Jan. 13 with ''Invitation to the Dance,'' Gene Kelly's 1956 feature in which three stories are told through dance and pantomime. Kelly's film certainly defied Hollywood standards; he began shooting in 1952, and its eventual release was a hard-won battle.\nEven more daring independent filmmakers are showcased in another program, ''Moving Bodies After Maya Deren,'' named in honor of that experimental filmmaker, who died in 1961. Organized by Robert Haller, the director of collections and special projects at Anthology Film Archives, it consists of 13 short films in which directors, including Norman McLaren, Ed Emshwiller, Amy Greenfield and Ms. Deren, intrigued by the possibilities of the body, maintained that dance films no longer needed to exist solely as documents. They could be self-sustaining works of art.\n''The driving force behind these films was not to record a dance but to present an interior vision of it,'' Mr. Haller said. ''We're seeing what is in the dancer's mind. The films are almost cinematic transmutations of what is normally visible.''\nThe program, which features a panel discussion with Mr. Haller and selected filmmakers, is a trove. One highlight is ''Nine Variations on a Dance Theme,'' directed by Hilary Harris and starring a radiant Bettie de Jong. This 13-minute film, from 1967, places Ms. de Jong, a former Paul Taylor dancer, alone in a studio, her long body encased in a knitted bodysuit, her face as still and serene as a woman in a Flemish painting.\nRepeatedly, she extends her leg to the side, raising her arms over her head before sinking to the floor in a series of stretches, systematic and luxurious. Each time she begins anew, the camera explores her body from a different angle, documenting both a dancer's private ritual and Ms. de Jong's tranquil self-assurance.\nIn the festival such vintage films generally put their modern counterparts at a disadvantage. Contemporary shorts may be full of passion for the form, but they generally lack imagination. ''Rapt,'' an underwater solo for a pregnant Sara Joel, is less poetic than trivial. Rita Blitt's ''Caught in Paint,'' a collaboration with the photographer Lois Greenfield and the choreographer David Parsons, is a gimmick without recompense. Dancers, photographed behind sheets of Mylar on which Ms. Blitt has painted thick strokes, leap in the air; to put it kindly, the images resemble abstract designs on a shower curtain.\nThe more striking ''Break,'' Shona McCullagh's short set in rural New Zealand, illustrates, with surprising subtlety, the breakdown of a family.\nOften, more gratification is found in films of dances documented in a more traditional manner. Along with Barbara Willis Sweete's shimmering adaptation of Mark Morris's ''Dido and Aeneas,'' another program, ''Forsythe and Cunningham,'' pairs William Forsythe's ''One Flat Thing, Reproduced'' and Merce Cunningham's ''Biped.'' Directed by Charles Atlas, ''Biped'' is stunning.\nThe festival also offers documentaries on admirable subjects like the dancer Josephine Baker, the French-Russian dancer and choreographer Serge Lifar and the postmodern American choreographer Lucinda Childs. In particular, ''Serge Lifar Musagète,'' by the French director Dominique Delouche, is fascinating for its archival clips, exceptional interviews with former dancers and rehearsal film of those dancers teaching their roles to current Paris Opera Ballet members.\n''Alberto and Carmen'' examines how the Cuban-born choreographer Alberto Alonso created his ''Carmen'' for Maya Plisetskaya of the Bolshoi. (Along with charming interviews with both, there is also film of Plisetskaya, Alicia Alonso, Alessandra Ferri and Svetlana Zakharova dancing the role.)\nAnd in the surprisingly compelling ''Invitation to the Dance: Body and Taboo,'' the filmmaker Gerhard Schick captures the working process of Gerda Koenig, a German choreographer who has muscular dystrophy, as she creates a dance with disabled performers in Kenya. Essentially, it is a film about the artistic process; Ms. Koenig, tough and refreshingly unsentimental, doesn't suffer fools gladly.\nFitting into the slippery place where film and performance coexist are two intriguing offerings: ''Dancing Figure/Tancalak,'' a collaboration between the Hungarian filmmaker Ferenc Grunwalsky and the dancer Andrea Ladanyi, and ''Cartes Postales,'' which offers American viewers a rare glimpse of Raimund Hoghe, a dancer, choreographer and, for 10 years, the dramaturge for Pina Bausch. This film, by Richard Copans, is a fascinating exploration of solitary states that showcases Mr. Hoghe, a slight man with a hunchback, in a duet with the taller, younger Lorenzo de Brabandere. Their physical tension is palpable, yet the focus is on Mr. Hoghe, whose crooked body is surprisingly spry. He exudes an uncanny innocence.\nNatasha Balakhnecheva, a Russian ballet student whom Efim Reznikov made famous in the 1996 documentary ''Terpsichore's Captives I,'' returns in ''Terpsichore's Captives II.'' (Both films will be screened.) In the first part Ms. Balakhnecheva battled with her teacher, Ludmila Pavlovna Sakharova, the fiery artistic director of the Perm Ballet School. Then, the young dancer wrote in her diary: ''Oh, ballet! A marvelous art! It melts the iciest heart. How I hate it.''\nIn Part II Ms. Balakhnecheva seeks self-liberation by working with the modern choreographer Bill T. Jones. While it's a pleasure to see how Ms. Balakhnecheva has evolved, the film is an unsatisfying follow-up. Mr. Jones, less a proponent of individuality than a different sort of dictator, drives the young dancer to a different type of despair. (It's also unclear what he's actually after, choreographically speaking.) His relentless, vague questions -- ''What is freedom for a classical dancer?'' -- gives the talented Ms. Balakhnecheva little room to breathe on her own.\nKelly's ''Invitation to the Dance,'' as uneven as it is, remains a precious commodity for the rare opportunity to witness the extraordinary Diana Adams. A dancer with both American Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet (where George Balanchine created roles for her in many of his most important ballets, including ''Agon''), Ms. Adams, who died in 1993, appears as the Hatcheck Girl in ''Ring Around the Rosy,'' the second section of Kelly's film. Tall, with a cool, indifferent glamour, she glides through a jazzy, leg-splitting duet with Irving Davies.\nEven decades later, Ms. Adams is a dazzling force, displaying dancing that is indelibly marked with spontaneous wit and aplomb. Suddenly, she's not just another two-dimensional dancer in a movie; she transcends the screen.\nThe Dance on Camera Festival is at the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65thStreet, Lincoln Center, tonight through Sunday, and Jan. 12 and 13.

When the broth is done, the cooked vegetables are easy to remove, still in their cloth package.\nThe reusable sock is large enough to accommodate the chicken, too, but for me, keeping the vegetables and bird separate is the important feature. That way, the chicken does not mix with soggy vegetables and herbs. (For a richer soup, consider using a quart or two of purchased organic chicken stock instead of water.)

1816050	Trying to Clear Absinthe's Reputation	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E3DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	READERS of Ernest Hemingway know ''Death in the Afternoon'' as a book about bullfighting. But to drinkers with a taste for obscure booze, it is also a cocktail that Hemingway contributed to a 1935 collection of celebrity recipes. His directions: ''Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.''\nWhen I heard about this concoction last week and wondered how Champagne bubbles would fare in the milkiness, I couldn't just go to my local liquor store and buy absinthe. I had to substitute one of the anise-flavored alcohols that took absinthe's place when it was banned in France and in the United States about a century ago.\nToday absinthe is legal again throughout Europe, and while it is still banned in this country, it is easy to buy over the Internet. Its reputation, however, remains as cloudy as the cocktails that are made with it. Some welcome clarification has now arrived in the form of a new study by a team of German chemists and physicians.\nAbsinthe is a distilled spirit flavored with a variety of herbs and spices, primarily wormwood, an aromatic, bitter shrub. The key constituent of wormwood is a chemical called thujone, which gives it -- and absinthe -- a penetrating evergreen aroma. (Thujone is also a major component of the herb sage.) Thujone and the other aromatic compounds are what cause absinthe to become milky when it's diluted. The aromatics are more soluble in alcohol than in water, so when the concentrated spirit is cut with wine or water, they cluster together in tiny droplets that reflect light from their surfaces. Instantly, what was a clear liquid clouds over.\nAbsinthe became tremendously popular throughout Europe in the 19th century. It was blamed for causing hallucinations, mental instability and criminal behavior, which medical authorities attributed to thujone. This belief helped get absinthe banned. But according to the new study, by Dirk W. Lachenmeier and colleagues, the modern medical consensus is that absinthism was either simple alcohol poisoning -- some absinthes were 70 percent alcohol, nearly double the strength of most distilled drinks -- or caused by methanol and other toxic adulterants found in some cheap absinthes.\nThujone is true to its reputation in one respect: it does turn out to have unusual pharmacological properties. It interacts with several neurotransmitter systems in the brain, including one that is also activated by the cannabinoids in marijuana. But while absinthe will get you drunk, it won't make you stoned. In one experiment, a dose of thujone equivalent to a pint of absinthe lowered the subjects' performance on attention tests and made them more anxious. Very large doses are toxic, but moderate consumption appears to be safe.\nBut buyer beware: Europe currently has no regulations on how absinthe is made or what it can be made from. The German chemists think some rules are a good idea: some Czech brands they sampled were tinted turquoise, were flavored with mint instead of wormwood, tasted sweet instead of bitter and were so dilute that they didn't grow cloudy when mixed with water.\nWhich brings me back to my Death in the Afternoon cocktail. When I poured the Champagne into my absinthe substitute, Pernod, a good milkiness developed, but after the initial whoosh there were only a couple of lonely bubble clusters on the surface, slowly and invisibly replenished from the murky depths. I felt only a slight prickle on the tongue. It seemed a waste of effervescence, especially after what I've been learning from the world expert on the subject.\nGérard Liger-Belair is a physicist at the University of Reims, where he trains a high-speed digital camera through a microscope onto glasses of wine from local cellars. His 2004 book, ''Uncorked: The Science of Champagne,'' revealed that most Champagne bubbles arise from something you might be tempted to scour from your flutes: dust.\nKitchen towels and the ambient air deposit tiny hollow cellulose fibers from cotton, paper and other plant products on the surface of a clean glass. The air pockets in those hollow fibers allow dissolved carbon dioxide molecules in the wine to collect and pop off in a bubble, which leaves a remnant behind to start the process all over again. As they rise in the glass, the bubbles gather more carbon dioxide, so they expand and accelerate. When they burst at the surface, they shoot tiny jets of liquid as much as an inch into the air, tickling the nose and delivering aroma.\nIn more recent work Professor Liger-Belair has shown just how lucky we are in the quality of our plant dust. It turns out that the cellulose fiber hollows are of just the right size -- about a tenth the diameter of a human hair -- to produce small, regularly spaced bubbles that keep coming for a long time. If they were much narrower, then the bubbles would be released faster and closer together, and the gas would be exhausted from the glass much sooner. If the fiber interior were as wide as a hair, then the bubbles would be more coarse, and we wouldn't get as many of them.\nBecause the fibers and the gas pockets are scattered across the glass surface, each bubble train rises in undisturbed isolation. The result is a clockwork release of bubbles, evenly spaced and pleasing to the eye.\nChampagne flutes are sometimes scratched or engraved to encourage more predictable bubbling, but the research shows that this produces a microscopic trench in which gas pockets grow into one another and coalesce, so the bubble size and release are irregular and chaotic. Help may be on the way, though. ''We are working hard with glassmakers to produce artificial nucleation sites with the same properties as cellulose fibers,'' Professor Liger-Belair wrote in an e-mail message. ''This is a nice little challenge for nanotechnology!''\nAnother challenge: With all Professor Liger-Belair has discovered about the birth and life of Champagne bubbles, is there a way to make ''Death in the Afternoon'' a bit more lively?\nTHE CURIOUS COOK
1816051	Ancient Messages, Hidden in a Dusty Bottle From Long Ago	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	THE lineup of wines to be served with dinner was extraordinary, including a Montrachet from 1939 and a Volnay Caillerets from 1929. Still, the wine I couldn't wait to try was the '46 Meursault Charmes.\nThat would be the 1846.\nThe dinner was in honor of Bouchard Père & Fils, the venerable Burgundy producer and négociant, which was celebrating its 275th anniversary with a tasting of some very, very old wines. It was held at the historic Château de Beaune, a 15th-century fortress here that has been the producer's ceremonial and corporate home since 1810. In addition to the 1846, Bouchard was to pour a relative youngster, the 1865 Beaune Grèves Vigne de L'Enfant Jésus.\nBoth of these ancient vintages had spent their long lives in the bowels of the chateau, where thick walls keep the cellars cool and the bottles can rest undisturbed. As rare as it is to taste wines this old, it's even more unusual to taste bottles with such an unimpeachable provenance.\nScientists know that the gradual interaction between a fine wine and small amounts of oxygen results in what we call aging. Firm tannins soften and aggressive aromas of fruit mellow and evolve into complex new characteristics. A wine becomes harmonious and shows new dimensions.\nThat's the ideal, anyway. How the wine is stored and handled and a host of other factors can be the difference between a sublime old bottle and an expired soup. What no one has been able to do is predict when a wine will be at its peak or exactly how it will fare in its descent. What happens after a few decades along the aging trail is a mystery. But wine as old as these bottles borders on the mystical.\n''No producer makes a wine to be drunk after 80 years,'' said François Audouze, a retired French steel executive who now arranges dinners centered on old wines and who was at this dinner. ''When a wine is older than that, it is generally not the result of a will but of an accident.''\nThe evening had begun in a nondescript industrial area outside this handsome little city, which has been the center of the Burgundy wine trade for 300 years or more. First, we toured Bouchard's new winery with its great steel tanks, catwalks, lots of oak barrels, the smell of fermented grape juice, even -- gasp -- a bottling apparatus. Then there was a tasting of Bouchard's 2005 lineup; 2005 was an excellent year in Burgundy, and Bouchard's wines are elegant and pure.\nBut the luminaries on the tour this soggy late fall evening -- including Clive Coates, the British writer; Serena Sutcliffe, the head of Sotheby's international wine department; Allen Meadows of burghound.com, a leading Burgundy critic; and the French writers Thierry Desseauve and Jacky Rigaux -- hadn't come to Bouchard to sample unreleased wines. So it was with a discernible eagerness that we dispatched the initial tasting and headed to the chateau. After a Champagne reception (magnums of 1988 Cuvée des Enchanteleurs from Henriot, a corporate sibling of Bouchard), the 49 guests trooped expectantly to the dining tables, where the six wines would accompany six courses.\nWhat's in an ancient bottle almost matters less than the vivid historical images conjured up by the year on the label. An 1865? By the first hint of green on the vines that mid-April, Lincoln was dead, ''Hush'd Be the Camps Today,'' as Walt Whitman wrote that year.\nThe 1846? Not quite as resonant with me, although the French might have thought of Louis-Philippe, the last king to rule France, who was teetering on the throne before being unseated in 1848. The 1929 brought up the stock market crash and the start of the Great Depression, though I couldn't help thinking of my father, who was born in 1929 at the height of the summer.\nYet none of the wines summoned visions as searing as the 1939 Montrachet. As New Yorkers were enjoying their World's Fair, the French army had just been mobilized with France's entry into World War II. The harvest that fall stretched from days to weeks, Mr. Meadows recounted, as the women and children who were left behind picked grapes when they could, resulting in uneven degrees of ripeness.\nPerhaps that explained why the '39 Montrachet, the second wine served after a well-balanced 1992 Chevalier-Montrachet, seemed so odd. It was a dark amber gold, with flavors of sherry and caramel, as if it were slightly oxidized. It smelled sweet yet tasted dry, and truthfully it was slightly disappointing. At first, at least. But an hour later, around the time I might have thought exposure to air would have dried out an older wine, the '39 Montrachet was just coming alive, with a beautiful, brilliant minerality. It was lesson No. 1 of this meal: never give up on a wine.\nLesson No. 2 came from Mr. Meadows, who has made it his business to taste wines from every vintage of the 20th century and before, if he can find them. ''Pay attention to the texture,'' he advised, alluding to the fact that the two 19th-century wines predated the phylloxera epidemic, which devastated European vineyards in the late 1800's. The 1846 and '65 would be those rare Burgundies grown on their own rootstock instead of on grafted American roots, the only protection against phylloxera.\nThe moment of truth came. The 1846 was poured carefully but generously by the wine stewards, who had opened five bottles. The labels looked almost new, no surprise there. The humidity in a good wine cellar will rot paper, so wineries rarely label bottles until they are ready for shipping. The corks looked fresh, too. With its older bottles, Bouchard replaces the cork every 25 to 30 years, sacrificing one bottle to top off the others, which keeps air from aging the wine more rapidly.\nWhat can one say about a wine 160 years old? It was amber, browner than the 1939, but with wonderfully fresh aromas of lime, grapefruit, chalk and earth, and the slightest overlay of caramel. In the mouth it was vibrant with acidity that was remarkable in a wine this old.\nTasting it blind, I would have guessed it to be 100 years younger -- no, make that 130 years younger. And Mr. Meadows was right about texture: this wine was alive and joyous, almost thrusting itself out of the glass. I thought of horse carts, canals and steam engines. Pas mal, as the French say -- not a bad little chardonnay. And it got even better over time. What was it served with? I seem to remember chicken in cream sauce. It didn't much matter.\nReds were next, beginning with an appetite-whetter, Le Corton 1990, young and dark with wild berry aromas. Then, with the lamb, the 1929 Volnay Caillerets, Ancienne Cuvée Carnot, was poured. The '29 and '90 vintages were both exceptional in Burgundy, and the '29 was almost as dark as the '90, yet with a sedate sweet fruit aroma balanced by minerals. With time in the glass it developed a smell of truffles.\nFinally, the last wine of the evening was poured, the 1865 Beaune Grèves Vigne de L'Enfant Jésus, from a vineyard entirely owned by Bouchard. Like the 1846, it too had the lively texture of youth. Its color was still vibrant, pale ruby with touches of orange around the edges. The fruit was gentle yet striking, reminiscent of the 1929 and even the '90, like a family resemblance seen over generations.\nWhere I was simply dazzled by the 1846, the 1865 conjured up a feeling of respect and awe. We were tasting a legacy, transmitted long after its makers had died and conveying emotions that might have been inconceivable back then. At a moment like that, I had no doubt that winemaking can rise to the level of an art.\nI thought of those bottles deep in the cellar. They had survived the Franco-Prussian War, World War I and World War II, when Bouchard had constructed false walls in the cellars to conceal their older bottles from the Nazis. This year, Bouchard will no doubt put away a few bottles of those promising 2005's. May their passage be somewhat easier.\nTHE POUR
1816052	A Princeton Maverick Succumbs to a Cultural Shift	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E2DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Logan Fox can't quite pinpoint the moment when movies and television shows replaced books as the cultural topics people liked to talk about over dinner, at cocktail parties, at work. He does know that at Micawber Books, his 26-year-old independent bookstore here that is to close for good in March, his own employees prefer to come in every morning and gossip about ''Survivor'' or ''that fashion reality show'' whose title he can't quite place.\n''It kills me,'' Mr. Fox, 53, said over coffee on Friday afternoon, shaking his head. ''The amount of time spent discussing culturally iconic shows has superseded anything in the way of books that I can detect. Discussing books is very much one on one. It just hurts me.''\nMr. Fox is bracing himself for an emotionally wrenching few months. In December Micawber announced that it would close, after years of fighting not only the tyranny of other media but also the steady encroachment of big-box retail competitors and the Internet.\nIndependent bookstores, of course, have been under siege for nearly two decades by the megachains and the Web retailers, and have been steadily dropping away, one by one. Now, though, the battle is reaching some of the last redoubts.\nMr. Fox said that Micawber's first chain competitor, Encore Books, arrived in the mid-1990s, and his sales plummeted 25 percent, nearly putting him out of business. Soon after, Barnes & Noble and Borders came to town. And then there was Amazon.com.\nBut beyond those factors, Mr. Fox said, he blames a change in American culture, in the quickening pace of people's lives, in the shrinking willingness to linger. During the 1980s, in the store's early days, customers would come in and stay all afternoon, carefully inspecting the books that were packed tightly together, spine to spine.\nNo longer. ''The driving force of all of this is the acceleration of our culture,'' Mr. Fox said. ''The old days of browsing, the old days of a person coming in for three or four hours on a Saturday and slowly meandering, making a small pile of books, being very selective, coming away with six or seven gems they wanted, are pretty much over. If you go to the Strand or to Micawber Books today, it's a whole different gear, where society wants satisfaction and fulfillment now.''\nThe other crisis for independent booksellers, Mr. Fox said, is the current state of publishing. The job of building writers' reputations and nurturing them has fallen to agents, he said. Publishers are concerned only with the bottom line, he added, looking for the home run instead of the single.\nAnd there is the question of quality. Though Micawber carries a few, Mr. Fox laments the rapid growth of the celebrity cookbook genre. Children's books, in particular, are driven by marketability instead of creativity, said Bobbie Fishman, the children's books buyer at Micawber. ''It's either pirates, wizards, one of a series, or written by Katie Couric,'' she said.\nIndependent bookstores across the country are suffocating, squeezed by Amazon.com and the chain bookstores that deliver deeper discounts and wider variety than independent shops. According to the American Booksellers Association, a trade group of independent bookstores, there are about 2,500 such stores in the United States, down from about 4,700 in 1993. And that is not counting those that sell only used books.\nMicawber opened in 1981, when Princeton was an old-money kind of place, with independently owned shops lining Nassau Street, adjacent to the picturesque Princeton University campus. ''When we first came, every store on this street was a 15-, 20-year entrenched old-family business,'' Mr. Fox said.\nToday that same thoroughfare is dominated by chain stores like Ann Taylor and Foot Locker. Micawber Books, with its purple walls and its alien name, which comes from Dickens' novel ''David Copperfield,'' is the one that sticks out now.\nHalf the store is devoted to secondhand books and other vintage publications, like a stack of Archie comics on the register. The other half is new books, a well-edited mix that includes fiction, history, children's books and the occasional concession to popular taste, like Rachael Ray's ''Express Lane Meals.'' (There are also stalwarts, evidenced by the back wall of shelves lined with Penguin Classics.)\nMr. Fox is proudly from the old school of bookselling. He says he has only been inside a Barnes & Noble store three times. (''I can't do it,'' he said, grimacing.)\nIn the mid-1990s, when the struggling Micawber took on Margaret Griffin as a partner, she insisted that Mr. Fox abandon his system of 3-by-5-inch index cards in boxes and become computerized. The new Sony Reader, a handheld device that stores dozens of titles electronically? Never tried it.\n''I don't want to sound corny about it,'' Mr. Fox said. ''But there is something transformative about the book.''\nMr. Fox began as a bookseller in the '70s at the Strand Book Store in Manhattan, and moved to Princeton to open Micawber, then a store devoted entirely to secondhand books from his own personal library. His father, Joe Fox, was an editor at Random House, nurturing the careers of John Irving and Truman Capote. His childhood was sprinkled with the romantic stuff of traditional New York publishing, with swanky book parties attended by famous authors and writers for The Paris Review.\nIn her 1998 film, ''You've Got Mail,'' Nora Ephron used the name of his father, who, as it happens, was also a former boyfriend of hers. Joe Fox was the name she gave the character played by Tom Hanks, a chain bookstore owner who swiftly puts Meg Ryan and her tiny shop around the corner out of business.\nOf course, in the Micawber story, Logan Fox is in the Meg Ryan role, the person who champions the mom-and-pop store and derides the corporate behemoth.\nIn Micawber's case, Mr. Fox said there was no imminent financial crisis, only the recognition that years from now, selling the business would be a far more difficult task.\n''Ten years down the road, we couldn't imagine who would buy us at all,'' he said. After Micawber quietly put out the word that it was for sale, Princeton University offered to buy the building that houses the store for an undisclosed sum, and promised to bring in Labyrinth Books, a scholarly chain with stores in New Haven and Manhattan. All the architectural details incorporated into Micawber, Mr. Fox pointed out sadly, will be bulldozed. And he has no idea what he will do next.\nStill, Mr. Fox said he was trying hard not to be cynical. ''I consider this a success story,'' he said. ''Our intention was to be a good townspeople store.''
1816053	Male Misery Just Loves Female Company	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E2DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Time magazine shocked America by asking ''Is God Dead?'' on its cover in 1966. Vanity Fair is now needling the nation with Christopher Hitchens's essay ''Why Women Aren't Funny.''\nIt could also be that most men are not so funny, either, and women are just better at flattery and fake laughter.\nIn real life, which is to say, on television, there are beautiful women, funny women and also beautiful women cast in comic roles. ''30 Rock,'' on NBC, has two: Tina Fey and Jane Krakowski. CBS's ''New Adventures of Old Christine'' won Julia Louis-Dreyfus an Emmy Award last year.\nABC is even more in touch with its feminine side: ''Grey's Anatomy'' and ''Ugly Betty'' are packed with romance and tightly tailored to female audiences. But tonight that network is introducing two comedies that are oriented toward men.\n''The Knights of Prosperity'' and ''In Case of Emergency'' have similar conceits: each revolves around a group of pitiable male losers and one very pretty woman who puts up with them. NBC already has that dynamic on ''My Name Is Earl''; the two hapless heroes are abetted and cheerfully endured by Catalina (Nadine Velazquez), a sexy, soft-hearted Mexican immigrant who works as a motel maid.\nIt's one of those trends that is not new, just borrowed -- in their ''Road'' movies, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope never went anywhere without Dorothy Lamour.\nPerfect women are neither much fun nor intentionally funny, which is why the dumb blonde has proved such an enduring pillar of comedy: beautiful women require a leveling weakness to be tolerable. Stupid women are more accessible and also less likely to judge men too harshly. That quid pro quo is so ingrained that it is the entire premise of ''Beauty and the Geek,'' a CW reality show that pairs pretty, dimwitted women with brainy, socially inept men, and begins its third season tonight.\nBut sitcoms are now trying out less misogynist handicaps, from immigration status to bad luck. The male misfits of ''The Knights of Prosperity'' also enjoy the company of a Latin bombshell, Esperanza Villalobos (Sofía Vergara). Esperanza, like Catalina on ''Earl,'' is not a citizen and has a slight language barrier. (Both are fluent in English but mispronounce words in the manner of Charo.) Those impediments, however minor, keep success beyond their reach and force these beauties to cast their lot with potbellied idiots and social outcasts.\nOn ''In Case of Emergency,'' three 30-something high school friends whose lives take a sudden dip for the worse reconnect with another former classmate, Kelly Lee (Kelly Hu), a stunning Korean-American who was class valedictorian, but is working in a massage parlor. The first two episodes do not spell out Kelly's fall from grace, but do hint at troubles with men and self-esteem.\n''The Knights of Prosperity'' has the worse title but is the funnier of the two shows. Eugene Gurkin (Donal Logue), a janitor in Queens, talks his buddies into robbing Mick Jagger's apartment. They form a club, the Knights of Prosperity, to plan their heist. (The show was originally titled ''Let's Rob Mick Jagger,'' but Mr. Jagger, who makes a very funny cameo in the first episode, apparently did not care to have his name emblazoned on a sitcom indefinitely.)\nEugene has his epiphany watching Mr. Jagger give a tour of his vast apartment on Central Park West on an entertainment show. The rock star is particularly proud of his media room and his indoor swimming pool. ''It's a great pool, or so I'm told,'' he tells the camera as he tosses a ball into the water. ''Actually I hate getting wet myself, but the dogs love it.''\nEugene's crew includes a fellow janitor, a burly warehouse security guard and Gourishankar (Maz Jobrani), an Indian cabdriver who wants to know why it must be Mick Jagger. ''I don't get it,'' he exclaims. ''Why not some other celebrity like Alex Trebek or Willem Dafoe?''\nNaturally, the worst-laid plans go awry, and their plot becomes bigger and more harebrained with every episode. The break-in may never take place, but the characters are appealing, and the writing is spirited enough to carry the sitcom at least for a while.\n''In Case of Emergency'' is uneven, more antic than witty. Greg Germann, who played Richard Fish on ''Ally McBeal,'' is amusing as Sherman, a diet guru who hijacks a pastry truck and goes on a binging frenzy that lands him in jail. Jason (David Arquette) is an investment whiz who turns suicidal when his company collapses in scandal. They are best friends with Harry (Jonathan Silverman), an unhappily divorced greeting-card writer. It is Harry who recognizes his old high school crush Kelly as she prepares to give him an adult-rated massage. He persuades her to try to start a new life and let him be her friend.\nLuckily for him, Kelly has nowhere better to go.\nThe Knights of Prosperity ABC, tonight at 9, Eastern and Pacific times; 8, Central time.\nRob Burnett and Jon Beckerman, co-creators and executive producers; David Letterman, Mick Jagger and Victoria Pearman, executive producers; Merrill Karpf, Steve Tompkins and Eric Horsted, co-executive producers.

1816054	Arts, Briefly	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Oprah Winfrey Opens Her South African School\nOprah Winfrey yesterday opened the $40 million school she built in South Africa to give disadvantaged girls a chance for a better future, The Associated Press reported. ''I wanted to give this opportunity to girls who had a light so bright that not even poverty could dim that light,'' Ms. Winfrey said at a news conference attended by Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa, and the entertainment celebrities Tina Turner, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, Sidney Poitier, Chris Tucker and Spike Lee. Ms. Winfrey said she hoped the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls, above, in Henley-on-Klip, south of Johannesburg, could help ''change the face of a nation.'' She added, ''Girls who are educated are less likely to get H.I.V./AIDS, and in this country, which has such a pandemic, we have to begin to change the pandemic.'' Many of the girls come from afflicted families. Ms. Winfrey said that from 3,500 applicants, the academy, with a 28-building campus, accepted 152 girls ages 11 and 12. Eventually it will accommodate 450 and a broader age range. Ms. Winfrey said she planned a second school, for boys and girls, in the KwaZulu-Natal province.\nFather Seeks News Of Boy From Madonna\nThe father of the motherless Malawian boy whom Madonna seeks to adopt wants news of his son, Reuters reported, citing a newspaper report. Madonna has custody of the boy. ''I don't have her phone and mailing address,'' the father, Yohane Banda, left, told The Daily Times, based in Blantyre, Malawi. ''All I want is to find out how my son is, but I don't know how I can do it. I only talked to her once at the High Court, and I want to talk to her now and find out about my child.'' Mr. Banda, the father of David Banda, 1, spoke to the newspaper after it presented him with $788 from a Scottish nun, Christine Webster, who told the paper she believed that the child would have been better off in Malawi. Mr. Banda dismissed suggestions that he was seeking the boy's return and asked human rights organizations that opposed the adoption to refrain from interfering with his attempts to talk with Madonna. ''All I want is to find out how my child is doing and not to have him back,'' he was quoted as saying. The adoption last year by Madonna, under an interim order, prompted questions about the use of celebrity to circumvent laws governing adoption of Malawians by foreigners.\n'CSI' Creates New Crime Scene\n''CSI'' is branching out of television and into museums across the country, Variety.com reported. The ''CSI'' show that makes its debut on May 25 won't be ''CSI: Chicago.'' It will be ''The 'CSI' Experience,'' and the showcase won't be CBS, but rather the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, where an interactive exhibition will instruct adults and older children in the joys of forensic science. Visitors will be able to gather evidence from fictional crime scenes and test it inside laboratories and autopsy rooms with the help of multimedia presentations and recorded video messages from stars of the three ''CSI'' programs on CBS. In September, after the exhibition spends the summer in Chicago, it will begin a national tour of science museums that could last as long as seven years. The exhibition is financed by the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, CBS Consumer Products and the National Science Foundation.\nFrench Conductor For Vienna New Year\nFor the first time, a French conductor will usher in the New Year in Vienna, when Georges Prêtre leads the Vienna Philharmonic in the 2008 New Year's Day concert, Agence France-Presse reported. This year's concert was watched and heard by an audience of 50 million in 53 countries, organizers said. Televised by the Austrian station ORF, the concert saluted the entry of Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union with ''The Blue Danube'' by Johann Strauss the Younger. Mr. Prêtre, 82, is a former music director of the Paris Opera who has conducted most of the world's leading symphony orchestras.\nFootnotes\n''Fast Money,'' the weekly CNBC program that features a panel of Wall Street traders hashing over the day's big moves with the sort of intensity usually reserved for politics or sports, will move to prime time -- and a regular time slot, Monday through Friday at 8 p.m. -- beginning on Monday, a CNBC spokesman said. The Carnegie Hall debut of the Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Flórez, above, will be on March 10 at 8 p.m. The performance was to have been on Dec. 1 but was postponed because of illness. Previews don't begin until next Wednesday, but the run of the Classic Stage Company's presentation of the American premiere of ''A Spanish Play,'' written by Yasmina Reza, directed by John Turturro and featuring Zoe Caldwell, has been extended by two weeks, through March 4, at the theater at 136 East 13th Street, East Village. Theater by the Blind, the company made up of both visually impaired and sighted performers, will present a 90-minute version of Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream,'' beginning Jan. 27 at the Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan. The production, which features six actors playing all the roles, runs through Feb. 3.
1816055	In Rustic Greek Dishes, A Fresh Approach to Ancient Flavors	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE2DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	ASK New Yorkers to name a classic Greek dish, and many would say moussaka -- gooey layers of eggplant, ground meat and comfort. But a new breed of Greek restaurants here also serves dishes like rabbit phyllo, grilled branzino with artichoke confit and dandelion greens, and Cretan honey-braised lamb shank with yogurt pasta.\nTrend-setting chefs like Michael Psilakis at Onera, Christos Valtzoglou at Pylos and Michael Symon at Parea, to name a few, are giving Greek food new vibrancy. Thirty-four Greek restaurants are listed in the latest Zagat guide, 18 of them newcomers since 2000.\nSo I wondered, as I headed to Greece recently, whether I would encounter inventiveness at restaurants there, too.\nAs soon as a deconstructed version of a tomato stuffed with rice was placed before me at 48 Restaurant in Athens, I knew I need not have worried. The rice had been typically seasoned with tomato, cinnamon, pine nuts and currants but was shaped like ovals of sushi. Slabs of slow-roasted tomato topped them. That the chef, Christoforos Peskias, has Ferran Adrià as a mentor did not surprise me one bit.\nAs I traveled outside the big cities, I continued to be delighted by the fresh and new. In fact, as long as I stayed away from tourist places, I was in for an adventure.\nBut some of the most unusual yet simple and delicious food I found was in Rhodes, the large island not far from the coast of Turkey. This food was not obviously modern, but based on a sense of place and on the traditions and ingredients of the island. It's a rustic cuisine that New York restaurants have yet to discover.\nI came home with recipes I could not wait to try. Most were from Mavrikos, a 70-year-old family restaurant in Lindos, a town in the southwestern corner of Rhodes known for its beaches and a steep acropolis reached by stairs or donkey. When Lindos was a jet-setting destination, before islands like Mykonos and Patmos were on the social radar screen, Mavrikos had a star-studded clientele. Nelson Rockefeller, members of Pink Floyd and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis stopped by, said Michalis Mavrikos, who runs the restaurant.\nMost of the bold-face names have moved on, but Mr. Mavrikos and his brother, Dimitri, the chef, are maintaining the family's culinary traditions in the whitewashed dining room. Every evening, their father, Vassilis, 85, sits in one corner, near the small open kitchen, and casts a critical eye over everything.\nFor our party of six, Dimitri Mavrikos prepared a tasting menu of about 20 dishes.\n(Tackling the recipes for some of them when I got home, I was happy to discover that even the most exotic-tasting dishes called for ingredients that are sold in American health food and Greek specialty stores, and also online.)\nGigantes, as huge, succulent butter beans are called, were simmered in a dark, musky sauce seasoned with carob. ''We can gather the carob pods from trees all around,'' Michalis Mavrikos said.\nFresh local red shrimp were peeled and pounded, raw, into a paste and seasoned with onion, garlic and orange, for a rich alternative to taramosalata. It's a dish I can try now, since fresh Maine shrimp are in season.\nFreshly caught tuna loin was cured with sugar, salt and herbs, a little like gravlax, then sliced thin and served with pickled fennel. Gar, a long, skinny fish, was cooked and served in thick grape syrup, like saba, the Italian grape must. Poached skate was seasoned with herbs and pine nuts and formed into a timbale.\nMeltingly tender beef had been slow-cooked in a casserole with cracked wheat and seasoned with bergamot, an aromatic citrus fruit that grows on the island and is best known as the flavoring for Earl Grey tea.\n''You are probably thinking that some of these dishes, especially with the cracked wheat and exotic spices, came from Turkey,'' Michalis Mavrikos said. ''I assure you they do not.''\nThe seasonings for the tuna included fenugreek, a slightly pungent, grassy herb with seeds that can have a celery flavor. Although American cooks may associate it with Indian cooking, it grows wild on Rhodes, as does cumin, another seasoning used in some of the dishes.\nIf there is any non-Greek influence in the food at Mavrikos, it is likely to be French or Italian. When the Turks controlled Rhodes, the Mavrikos brothers' paternal grandfather moved to Marseilles, where he owned a bistro. When Italy took over Rhodes in 1912 he returned, married an Italian woman and opened the restaurant in 1933. His son, Vassilis, studied cooking in Athens before returning to cook in the family restaurant.\nDimitri Mavrikos said the cooking of his father and grandparents, along with the local traditions, are his most compelling influences.\n''When I plan my menus I first try to find local things, vegetables from the villages, fish from nearby,'' he said. ''But local fresh fish are not as plentiful as they once were and it's getting harder to find them.''\nThe chef travels, often to London, when the restaurant is closed in winter.\n''I'm always a little sad when I'm abroad,'' he said. ''I often can't find real Greek food and rarely are there any Greek wines.''\nPerhaps he should plan a trip to New York, where he'll find Greek wines and respectable and inventive Greek food as well.\nSlow-Cooked Beef with Cracked Wheat Adapted from Mavrikos Restaurant, Rhodes, Greece Time: 3 1/2 hours\n2 1/2 pounds shin of beef, with bone, in 2-inch chunks\n2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil\n1/2 cup finely chopped onion 1 clove garlic, minced 2 medium-size ripe tomatoes, finely chopped 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 2 bay leaves 4 whole allspice Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup dry white wine 3 tablespoons preserved bergamot (see note) 21/3 cups cracked wheat (not instant bulgur).\n1. Place beef in a pot with water to cover, bring to a boil and cook 5 minutes. Drain and dry meat. 2. Heat oil in a heavy 4-quart casserole, add meat and lightly brown. Add onion, garlic, tomatoes, coriander seeds, bay leaves, allspice, salt and pepper and wine. Simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and fold in bergamot and cracked wheat. 3. Heat oven to 275 degrees. Transfer contents of casserole to a baking dish large enough to hold ingredients with room to spare. Pour 2 1/2 cups water on top. Bake, uncovered, about 1 1/2 hours. Take a spoon and push down into wheat to make sure it seems quite moist throughout. Add another 1/2 cup or so of water if it seems dry. Top layer of wheat will become crusty. Continue cooking about 1 1/2 hours longer, until wheat is very tender. 4. Remove from oven. Allow to sit for 15 minutes. Use a large spoon to fold ingredients together once or twice, adding salt and pepper if necessary, then serve.\nYield: 6 servings.\nNote: Bergamot is sold in Greek shops and at www.titanfood.com as pergamont.\nTomato Sushi Adapted from 48 Restaurant, Athens Time: 3 1/2 hours\n8 ripe plum tomatoes, about 2 1/4 pounds 3 cloves garlic 2 sprigs fresh thyme\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, more for brushing 1 medium onion, finely chopped 1 bay leaf\n3/4 cup sushi rice\n1/2 cup dried currants 2 tablespoons white rum\n1/4 cup rice vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar\n1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 3 tablespoons julienned mint leaves 1/3 cup toasted pine nuts Salt and freshly ground white pepper\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin.\n1. Heat oven to 250 degrees. Quarter six tomatoes. Scoop out pulp and seeds and reserve, leaving only flesh attached to skin. Place wedges skin-side down on a foil-lined baking sheet. Slice 2 garlic cloves and scatter on tomatoes, along with leaves from 1 sprig thyme. Place in oven and roast 2 hours. Meanwhile, discard seeds from reserved tomato pulp. Peel and seed remaining tomatoes. Finely chop all. Mince remaining garlic clove. 2. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Add onion and remaining garlic and sauté over low heat until soft, about 20 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes, remaining thyme and the bay leaf and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until all liquid has evaporated and mixture barely begins to brown, about 2 hours. Remove from heat and let cool. Remove bay leaf and thyme sprig. 3. When tomato wedges have finished roasting, remove from oven, scrape off and discard skin and set wedges aside to cool. 4. Mix sushi rice in a small saucepan with 1 1/4 cups water. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook 15 minutes, until tender. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Place currants in a dish with rum. 5. Transfer rice to a bowl and mix in vinegar, sugar and cinnamon. Press cooked tomato and onion mixture in a sieve to remove excess oil. Discard oil and fold tomato mixture into rice. Fold in mint, currants with rum and pine nuts. Season with salt and pepper. Let sit for 30 minutes. 6. Form rice mixture into 24 ovals, using a scant tablespoon for each. Arrange on a platter. Place a piece of roasted tomato on each oval, like fish on sushi. Brush tomatoes with a little oil, sprinkle each with a few grains of cumin and serve.\nYield: 6 servings.\nTimbale of Skate Adapted from Mavrikos Restaurant, Rhodes, Greece Time: 1 hour, plus 1 hour's chilling\n2 skate wings with cartilage, 1 pound each, or 24 ounces lump crab meat 1 cup extra virgin olive oil, if using skate, plus 2 tablespoons for serving 1/3 cup white wine vinegar, if using skate Juice and grated zest of 1/2 orange Juice of 1 lemon 2 tablespoons pine nuts 1 tablespoon chopped flat leaf parsley 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves 1 teaspoon capers Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup red wine vinegar\n1/4 cup aged balsamic vinegar 1 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 small strip orange peel 3 black peppercorns Lemon wedges for serving.\n1. Place skate in a saucepan with olive oil and white wine vinegar. Fish should be just about covered. Bring to a simmer and cook on low heat 30 minutes. Let cool in oil. Remove flesh from cartilage and place in a bowl. Fish will become somewhat shredded. If using crab meat instead, place in a bowl. 2. Blend orange juice and zest, lemon juice, pine nuts, parsley, cilantro and capers in a blender until smooth. Fold into fish or crab meat. Season with salt and pepper. Pack some fish or crab meat into a 4-ounce mold (a 1/2-cup metal measuring cup works fine) and unmold onto a platter. Repeat with remaining fish or crab meat to make 6 timbales. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour. 3. Meanwhile, bring red wine vinegar, balsamic, brown sugar, orange peel and peppercorns to a boil in a small saucepan. Cook until reduced by half and syrupy. Let cool. 4. To serve, transfer timbales to individual plates and drizzle a little olive oil on each. Spoon a little syrup on plate around each, garnish with lemon wedges. Serve.\nYield: 6 servings.
1816056	After a Fire, a Beloved California Restaurant Vows to Rebuild	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E1DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	TO the people who found inspiration and solace at Manka's Inverness Lodge, word that a fire took down the small restaurant and lodge two hours northwest of San Francisco last week was akin to news that a brilliant, eccentric and dear old friend had passed away.\nManka's fed actors like Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt and writers like Isabel Allende and Robert Haas. It was the place Thomas Keller chose to celebrate his 45th birthday. Michael Bauer, the executive food and wine editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, ate Thanksgiving dinner there last year.\nThe draw of Manka's was in part the 1917-era Arts and Crafts main lodge building, filled with original Stickley furniture and four rustic but carefully imagined guest rooms. Some of it was location, above foggy Tomales Bay and just east of the wild Pacific Ocean shoreline.\nThe heart of Manka's, though, is Margaret Grade (pronounced GROD-ee), who in the early '90s weaned herself from a career as a neuropsychologist specializing in AIDS-related research to take over the rickety lodge.\nIn the ensuing years, she became both the intimate and business partner of the chef Daniel DeLong. Together, they built meals out of ingredients that came from the neighborhood. That includes oysters from the bay across the street -- something even Alice Waters, another frequent guest, can only dream of.\nDavia Nelson, a food journalist, ate breakfast at Manka's on Dec. 26, the day before the fire. Ms. Nelson is half of the public radio duo the Kitchen Sisters, who produce a series called ''Hidden Kitchens.'' What struck her about that Boxing Day breakfast were the descriptions on the menu, which started with satsuma juice and included candied ginger scones with ''coastal whipped dream'' and ''an Inverness egg keeping company with grits and a healthy bite of housemade bacon.'' It ended with two sorbets.\n''Need I say more?'' Ms. Nelson wrote in an e-mail message describing her meal. ''A duet of sorbets for breakfast. Cream upon cream upon pork upon egg.''\nThe soul of Manka's was most evident in those menu descriptions, which reflected Ms. Grade's quirky notions of food.\n''She once told me she was nestling a duck egg next to the duck leg, returning the baby to its mother,'' Ms. Nelson wrote.\nThe night of the blaze, which fire officials believe started when high winds blew a tree into the lodge and damaged a water heater, Ms. Grade first made sure the guests were safe. Elizabeth Falkner, one of San Francisco's most notable pastry chefs, evacuated along with Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal, the acting siblings. Ms. Grade walked around the building with a sort of detached curiosity as the fire consumed her collection of antiques, log bed frames and fine linens. She was, she imagines, a bit in shock.\n''Then I heard my ovens fall,'' she said. It was then that the tears came.\nThe couple plans to rebuild. Meanwhile, they will keep cooking. Using some of the undamaged outlying buildings, they plan a dinner for the neighbors who supply their food, a veterinarian who raises rabbits and the local egg guy among them.\nBut first, on Friday, they will hold a dinner that will serve as a wake for the inn.\n''I'm from the Midwest and that's all we do when someone dies,'' Ms. Grade said. ''We bring in the bad macaroni salad. Except in this case, it will be good macaroni salad.''
1816057	Sawyer Signals Commitment to Morning Show	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E1DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Diane Sawyer, whose continued commitment to ''Good Morning America'' has been the subject of speculation since Charles Gibson departed the show in June, has in recent weeks left some executives at ABC with the impression that she intends to remain with the program until at least early summer, according to one executive briefed directly on Ms. Sawyer's status.\nBy sending signals that she intends to stay with ''Good Morning America'' -- at least through the end of the current prime-time television season, and perhaps longer still -- Ms. Sawyer has prompted some exhaling in the upper echelons of both the news division and the network as a whole. That is because she remains ABC's biggest news star in the morning -- and perhaps the evening as well -- on a program that is by far the news division's most valuable, with annual profits believed to be well in excess of $100 million.\nThe executive, who spoke yesterday on condition of anonymity because of the delicate diplomacy involved, said Ms. Sawyer had met before Christmas, as she does periodically, with David Westin, the president of ABC News. Separately, the official said, she had also had a holiday lunch in New York with Robert A. Iger, the president and chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, ABC's corporate parent, though that get-together was characterized as more social than business.\nBy staying put, Ms. Sawyer, 61, also promises to keep ''Good Morning America'' competitive with ''Today'' on NBC, the ratings leader for more than a decade, at a moment when that program and its audience are continuing to adjust to a new co-anchor, Meredith Vieira, who replaced Katie Couric in September. (Since Mr. Gibson's departure for ''World News,'' ''Good Morning America'' has gone through some growing pains of its own, as it introduced Chris Cuomo as its news reader and Sam Champion as its weatherman, while pairing Robin Roberts with Ms. Sawyer as lead anchors.)\nIn the most recent November sweeps period, ''Today'' had an average daily audience of 5.8 million, about 735,000 more than ''Good Morning America,'' which drew an audience of about 5.1 million, according to Nielsen Media Research. During the same period a year ago, the lead of ''Today'' over ''Good Morning America'' was about 5,000 viewers larger, although both shows have lost viewers over the last year.\nIn June an ABC spokesman said Ms. Sawyer remained committed to ''Good Morning America'' through at least early 2007. When asked in September how much longer she planned to stay with the program, she told a reporter that she was not ready to entertain that question.\n'''I'm sorry if it sounds like a dodge,'' she said at the time. ''I truly am looking ahead and enjoying this part. And there is plenty of time to think about what remains after -- when and whether.''\nSince then Ms. Sawyer has appeared to throw herself into the program anew, traveling to North Korea -- for both ''Good Morning America'' and a prime-time special for ABC -- and later Israel (for less than 24 hours), as well as landing the first interview with Mel Gibson after his drunken-driving arrest (which the network also played big in the morning and evening) and, yesterday, reporting at length from South Africa on the opening of a private school for girls by Oprah Winfrey.\nWhen asked yesterday about Ms. Sawyer, Jeffrey Schneider, a senior vice president of ABC News, dismissed any notion of a timetable for her tenure on the program.\nHe added: ''Diane is having a great time on 'G.M.A.' She loves the new team. And she has had an unrivaled run of groundbreaking reporting which has her passionately engaged.''\nMs. Sawyer's current contract with the network extends for at least two more years, said the executive with knowledge of her situation. But Ms. Sawyer has always characterized her tenure on ''Good Morning America'' as temporary -- and the network has regarded it as such -- even if it has been eight years since she joined the show, at a moment of crisis, after the network had just jettisoned a new, low-rated anchor team.
1816058	A Familiar Formula, Until You Take a Bite	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E1DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	IT would be easy to feel cynical about Mai House.\nHere comes the restaurateur Drew Nieporent, a one-man larder for much of TriBeCa, larding the neighborhood with another clangorous destination for buzz-conscious diners.\nHere come the rolls, skewers, noodles and black cod of an Asian-themed menu with echoes of many others. Here come the house cocktails, nearly a dozen of them, with their flavored vodkas, fruit purées, pronounced sweetness and attendant questions: when did the line between adults' elixirs and children's punch become so thin? Is this happy hour or recess?\nCynicism would be easy, no question. But it would be a mistake. It would also be hard to maintain for anyone who takes a seat, grabs a set of chopsticks and makes his or her way through the menu, rife with surprises and out-and-out delights.\nCombining Vietnamese flavors with other Asian influences and many of the go-to meats of the moment, Mai House produces an unusually appealing roster of dishes, the best of which make statements at once louder and more nuanced than those at less thoughtful restaurants with roots in Southeast Asia.\nCredit for that goes largely to its chef, Michael Huynh, who is also an owner of Mai House. But credit goes as well to Mr. Nieporent, who had the good sense to pluck Mr. Huynh from Bao 111 in the East Village, shuttle him across town and set him up with a bigger budget, kitchen and stage.\nAt Bao 111, which opened in 2003, I was consistently impressed by Mr. Huynh's refusal to coddle diners with indiscriminate sweetness or assault them with intemperate heat.\nBut I was also convinced that while he had a fine arsenal of ideas and ingredients, he and his partners, who now operate Bao 111 without much involvement from him, hadn't aced the running of a restaurant. Dishes were overcooked. Service was erratic.\nEnter Mr. Nieporent, to some extent repeating what he did in mid-2005 when he opened the Mexican restaurant Centrico in TriBeCa. For Centrico he also forged a partnership with a rising chef who had garnered attention at a less splashy enterprise in a less upscale neighborhood. The chef in that case was Aarón Sánchez, the force behind Paladar on the Lower East Side.\nMai House works better than Centrico, though it's not as visually arresting. By the design standards of downtown restaurants with more than 100 seats, it's a tame affair, making do for the most part with exposed brick, latticed woodwork, silk panels, a semi-open kitchen and dangling lighting fixtures that look like overgrown, airborne Hostess Sno Balls.\nThere are more impressive efforts on the plates. Mr. Huynh has transplanted some of the dishes from Bao 111, tweaked others, come up with new creations and, of course, raised the prices, though not absurdly.\nAt Bao 111 he wrapped thinly sliced beef short rib around thick stalks of lemon grass. At Mai House he swaps in tender lamb -- a combination with a more distinctive personality.\nThose improvised skewers were among about a dozen appetizers, a few of which you can skip. Don't bother with the pro forma summer rolls or hot fried mushroom rolls in which the flavor of the mushrooms, including chanterelles and shiitakes, didn't fully come through.\nBut don't miss a thick white yam soup with a bevy of succulent rock shrimp and bracing currents of a classic fish sauce.\nMake sure to try crunchy nuggets of cuttlefish, which answered the pesky question of how to give fried calamari a fresh spin. Easy: substitute a sea creature that's a close cousin, but more delicate, and limit the seasoning of the rice-flour batter to salt and pepper.\nBut the best appetizer of all was an exquisitely balanced salad with ribbons of grilled hanger steak folding under, over and around pineapple, pomelo, kaffir lime, cucumber, chili pepper and rau ram, a minty herb often called the Vietnamese coriander. The salad had heat, tartness and a teasing sweetness that never went overboard or wore you out. It was serene and sassy, juicy and crisp.\nMr. Huynh cranked up the fire for two of the best entrees. One was a clay pot of cubed chicken and whole quail eggs swimming in a deep pool of fish sauce and chicken stock. The irresistible perfume of lemon grass rose from the pot, lulling you into a calm soon shattered, in the happiest of ways, by bird's eye chilies.\nThe comparable heat in the spicy house laksa, an Asian soup of sorts, spread through a thick, tawny curry stippled with fat, squiggly noodles. As a bonus, a gigantic prawn jutted up from the surface, ready to be reeled in and gobbled up.\nA purée of toasted curry powder, cream, cauliflower and white pepper formed the backdrop for spicy beef cheeks in another standout entree. And in another, Mr. Huynh jazzed up what could have been a familiar pinwheel of duck breast slices by laying them over a fried hash of daikon radish, rice flour and duck confit.\nAs for that black cod, it defied convention by spurning miso. Instead the impeccably steamed fish hooked up with king mushrooms and an ecologically incorrect shark fin consommé that contributed little to the taste of the dish but plenty to its pleasantly sweaty, slippery texture.\nAs with the appetizers, there were entrees that didn't measure up, among them a mash of glass noodles and Dungeness crab in which the crab didn't register, and, similarly, a mix of rice noodles and lobster in which the lobster took too retiring a role. The lobster appeared in a category of noodle and fried rice dishes that represented one of the menu's weaker spans.\nDesserts were another letdown, with the notable exception of an almond and banana cake whose sauce of coconut-flavored tapioca became more engrossing with each bite.\nAnd with the equally notable exception of sticky rice with Chinese sausage, the sides (sautéed long beans, steamed mustard greens) seemed like afterthoughts, or rather like connivances to plump up the apparent bounty of the menu and the amount of the check.\nIs that too negative a read? While Mai House provides enough pleasure to keep cynical thoughts in check, it doesn't banish them altogether.\nMai House ** [Rating: Two Stars] 186 Franklin Street (Greenwich Street), TriBeCa; (212) 431-0606, myriadrestaurantgroup.com.\nATMOSPHERE -- Asian motifs and exposed brick combine for a loft-like effect in a spacious room with lighting fixtures that look like cotton balls.\nSOUND LEVEL -- Loud when crowded.\nRECOMMENDED DISHES -- Shrimp and white yam soup; salt and pepper cuttlefish; beef and pomelo salad; clay pot chicken; duck with daikon pancake; beef cheek stew; steamed cod with shark fin; whole red snapper; house laksa of prawns in curry broth; rice noodles with beef shank; sticky rice with Chinese sausage; almond banana cake.\nWINE LIST -- A concise, affordably priced international selection that's suited to the food.

1816059	Peruvian Proficiency On a Spit, With Pictures	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E1DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	IT was with great indifference that I dropped in on Pardo's, a month-old spot on Seventh Avenue South in the West Village.\nI had no history with the place, an offshoot of an established chain in Peru and Chile making its first foray onto North American soil. I had no particular reason to be so suspect.\nBut given the nasty number that chain restaurants usually do on chicken, and given the nasty number that dining in chain restaurants can do to your soul, my apprehension made sense.\nIn Pardo's corner, though, was the fact that it dishes up Peruvian cuisine, which borrows freely from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish and African cooking as it makes the best of the country's indigenous larder. It typically makes for good eating in even the most modest of settings.\nRight off the bat, the wait staff at Pardo's helped to ease my nerves. Servers managed sunny dispositions, even if they were made to wear shiny name tags and to work in an overlighted dining room that would make a Starbucks look like the pinnacle of interior design.\nAnd they helpfully suffered silly questions from inattentive diners, even when they could have snidely told them to look at the Denny's-style, picture-filled menu and figure out what yuquitas ($4) are for themselves. (Think of them as Incan fries: fried batons of starchy yucca, creamy inside and crunchy outside, served salted to the hilt, like pretty much everything at Pardo's.)\nBut what will allow Pardo's to rise above the chain landscape is its spit-roasted chicken, the pollo alla brasa. The chickens are very good: the skin is crisp, the flesh is moist, from the plumpest part of the meaty breast to the nubby ends of the well-seasoned legs.\nAre they a revelation? Maybe not, but they are an excellent option for harried West Villagers who don't want to sully their town house kitchens to put a roast bird on table. (It is $14 for a whole chicken, $7.50 for a half and $5 for a quarter.)\nHomely oversize posters on the restaurant's walls and reading lines on the menu will hammer it into your head that the chickens are cooked with ''14 secret ingredients.''\nSalt is apparent, as is pepper, and I'd wager that cumin is in there somewhere.\nAnother design-school-dropout poster touts Pardo's employment of rosemary and a South American herb called huacatay, so I would guess that those are in there, too. No one at the restaurant would give out any more information about the marinade than that.\nBeyond the rotisserie chicken, there's grilled marinated chicken (boneless half chickens for $9, quarters for $6), subpar fried chicken bits ($7) and chicken fried rice, or chaufa ($11).\nFried rice that isn't overly greasy can only be so bad, and the rice at Pardo's is pretty good. But other than a healthy dose of onion, there isn't much to distinguish it from any other competently executed version of the dish.\nSide dishes include very good canario beans ($4) cooked with pork, garlic and ají amarillo, a slightly spicy yellow pepper that is enshrined on its own poster on the dining room wall in a portion large enough to serve two.\nThere are also serviceable fried plantains ($3.50), meal-stretching seasoned rice ($3.50) and ears of Inca corn ($4), a type of corn with big, prehistoric-looking kernels but, sadly, little flavor.\nIf you're not in the mood for poultry, you're probably in the wrong place, unless you're feeling like a little bit of anticucho, grilled beef heart in another (or the same?) top secret Peruvian marinade.\nA little beefy, a little bloody-tasting, the skewered and grilled bits of heart were good enough to entice a dining companion who had never before savored that particular flesh into polishing off an $8 portion almost without assistance, except from his pisco sour, that classic Peruvian cocktail of pisco, lime, egg white and bitters.\nThat drink was actually a bit of a revelation. What other fast-food joint would serve cocktails, especially one so conscientiously executed.\nThe waitress used a tasting spoon to check the drinks she was making. I couldn't remember the last time I saw that at a nonchain restaurant, not to mention one that just winged its way up from Peru.\nPardo's 92 Seventh Avenue South (Grove Street), West Village; (212) 488-3900.\nBEST DISHES -- Rotisserie chicken, grilled beef heart, canario beans.\nPRICE RANGE -- Sides, $3.50 to $4; main courses, $7 to $14.\nCREDIT CARDS -- All major cards.\nHOURS -- Noon to 11 p.m. Sunday to Thursday; until midnight Friday and Saturday.\nWHEELCHAIR ACCESS -- All on one level.

1816060	Agency Lifts Restrictions on Caviar	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E0DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	ALL the nations surrounding the Caspian Sea can resume exporting sevruga and osetra caviar, an international environmental agency ruled yesterday. The agency, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or Cites, said the nations' efforts to monitor the depletion of endangered sturgeon had improved.\nLast year Cites banned almost all Caspian caviar exports by refusing to issue export quotas. It said that four of the countries bordering the sea had not provided enough information to determine the extent to which sturgeon stocks were being depleted by poaching, pollution, overfishing and development.\nIran, the only exception in 2006, was allowed to export about 100,000 pounds of osetra because its documentation was acceptable.\nThe quotas issued by Cites for the 2007 harvest cover three kinds of sturgeon -- sevruga, osetra from the northern Caspian, and Iranian osetra -- for all Caspian Sea countries, Iran, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan.\nNo quotas were given for beluga sturgeon, which is considered the most endangered of the major caviar sturgeons, and produces the most expensive caviar.\nThe total allowable caviar exports from the Caspian, about 82 tons, will be about 15 percent lower than it was in 2005, the last year that quotas were issued. Cites said the five nations had voluntarily reduced their overall sturgeon catch by about 20 percent.\n''The decision taken by Cites last year not to publish caviar quotas has undoubtedly helped to spur improvements to the monitoring programs and scientific assessments carried out jointly by the five Caspian neighbors,'' Cites's secretary general, Willem Wijnstekers, said in a statement yesterday. ''However, ensuring that sturgeon stocks recover to safe levels will take decades of careful fisheries management and an unrelenting struggle against poaching and illegal trade.''\nArmen Petrossian, the president of Petrossian, a major caviar dealer, was pleased. ''Keeping the door closed encourages the black market,'' Mr. Petrossian said. ''You have to establish quotas to create commercial interest.''\nBut Ellen K. Pikitch, the lead scientist for Caviar Emptor, a coalition of environmental groups, said Cites's decision was a poor one that would harm sturgeon populations.\n''They've provided no evidence that the populations can sustain this increased trade,'' Dr. Pikitch said. ''Cites has a bad track record on controlling the trade. They use the export quota system as a lever, turning it on and off, and there is no evidence that it works.''\nShe called for a complete moratorium on sturgeon fishing.\nAfter sturgeon stocks declined sharply in the 1990s, Cites began regulating the caviar trade in 1998. The 169 nations that belong to Cites voluntarily agree to abide by its decisions. Most countries will not accept imports of caviar without proper Cites documentation.\nCaviar dealers expect the ruling to cause prices to drop 10 or 15 percent, both for existing supplies of Caspian caviar and for farmed caviar.\nBut Caspian caviar from 2007 will not be available for at least two months. Except for Iranian osetra, any Caspian caviar now being sold is a year or two old, or illegal.

1816062	I'll Have What They Don't Know About Yet	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E0DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	OFF the menu. Have sweeter words ever been spoken, especially by New Yorkers? We all believe we deserve something more special than the people at the next table, and who's to say we're wrong?\nBut it's more than a smidgen of foie gras or an extra shaving of truffles that constitutes this particular thrill. It's a dish of one's own, homey enough that the imaginary mommy of your dreams might have cooked it, yet eaten in the midst of a social swirl.\nAnd the good news is, it's not only for regulars, those not-so-secret favorite children of restaurateurs. Mere mortals have a chance, too.\nMy favorite off-the-menu moment last year happened not in New York but in Yountville, Calif. I had spent three days in San Francisco before eating at Redd, a new restaurant in the Napa Valley. It was the fourth dinner of a two-week vacation, and the reductions and the foams were already piling up.\nOur waitress approached. ''Is there anything not on the menu?'' my husband said, asking about the specials. She considered. ''I think we have some meatballs in the kitchen,'' she said. I saw her then surrounded by a golden aura, like an angel from a prayer card.\n''You have meatballs?'' I asked furtively. I felt as if I were scoring dope in the schoolyard.\nShe checked with the chef to be sure.\n''We do, and we're happy to serve them as a middle course,'' she said.\nWho knows what accounted for our windfall -- a new restaurant wooing repeat customers or a kitchen burdened with too many leftovers -- but we were ecstatic. The meatballs were feather light, in a richly flavorful brown sauce, nestled alongside homemade egg pasta.\nThe dish was so unexpected, so deliciously satisfying, that I cannot remember my entree. But five months later I'm still thinking about those meatballs.\nIn October, with a group of friends, I ate at Primola, an Italian restaurant on Second Avenue between 64th and 65th Streets. Midway through I noticed a woman at our table devouring a work of art: veal chop parmigiana, well done. It covered a platter and looked like a beautiful pizza. I wouldn't rest until I had one of my own, so we returned to the restaurant with her and her husband a few weeks ago. ''Where is it?'' I asked, dismayed, scanning the menu.\nShe looked blank. ''I have no idea,'' she said. ''Every time I come, I just order it.'' As we did. It lived up to its promise, a thin-crust pizza, the thin crust made of meat.\nItalian restaurants, it seems, are almost always amenable to serving off the menu. A friend of mine is a regular at Sistina, also on Second Avenue, between 80th and 81st Streets, where he is addicted to what he calls nut pasta.\nThis turns out to be an off-the-menu favorite of the owner, Giuseppe Bruno, who first ate it on the Lipari Islands, near Sicily. A basic tomato sauce is mixed with a pesto of four kinds of raw nuts, which makes a creamless pink sauce with real body, enlivened by the kick of black and red peppers, a generous grating of pecorino and a few ribbons of fresh mint.\nIt's a crazy combination of bar food -- nuts and cheese -- with noodles, and while it's hard to figure out why it works, it's easy to eat a bowlful as you think about it (though not exactly cheap: $12 as an appetizer, $20 as an entree). He started serving it to regulars who wanted what he was eating, Mr. Bruno said, but he will prepare the dish for anyone who requests it when making a reservation.\nBeing a regular, after all, does not guarantee access to all of a restaurant's secrets. I recently sat at the bar at the Union Square Cafe, a place I consider a home away from home, and while paying the check saw an astonishing sight.\nFor the 21 years I've been going there, it has served a steak with mashed potatoes, a combination my mom used to make. I'm not a huge steak fan, so I rarely think about it. But that night, as I watched a vision go by -- a plate of steak heaped with the most beautifully bronzed, perfectly cut frites -- I flagged down a bartender.\n''If they have it in the kitchen, they'll do it for you,'' he said. (If they have what? Potatoes? There are no fries on the dinner menu.) I stared obsessively at the unsuspecting diner tucking in a few seats away, and fought the urge to go sit in his lap. Steak and mashed potatoes is just like home. But steak and French fries? That's Saturday night.\nNow I won't rest until I have them. Even on a Tuesday.\nBucatini With Raw Nut Pesto and Tomato Sauce (Bucatini alla Lipari) Adapted from Sistina Restaurant Time: About 40 minutes\nFor the tomato sauce:\n1/4 cup olive oil 1 medium onion, finely chopped 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 1 pound (about 2 cups) canned whole peeled tomatoes, with juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper\nFor the pesto: 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 teaspoons hot red pepper flakes 5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 2 cups mixed whole raw nuts, like pine nuts, walnuts, pistachios and hazelnuts 3 to 4 leaves of fresh mint Freshly ground black pepper\nFor the pasta: Salt 1 pound bucatini Fresh mint leaves, for garnish Grated sheep's milk pecorino.\n1. For tomato sauce: In a heavy-based saucepan over medium heat, heat oil and sauté onion until translucent. Add garlic and tomatoes with their juices, breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer uncovered until most of the juices have evaporated, 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare pesto. 2. For pesto: In a food processor, combine garlic, hot pepper flakes, olive oil, nuts and mint. Pulse to make a smooth paste (a slightly coarse nut butter). Season with black pepper to taste and set aside. 3. For pasta: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add bucatini and cook until al dente (firm to the bite). Set aside 1/2 cup pasta water, and drain pasta well. Return pasta to the warm pot and add pesto and tomato sauce. Toss well to coat, adding reserved water as needed to thin the sauce. Transfer to a warm serving bowl and garnish with fresh mint leaves. Serve with pecorino cheese passed separately.\nYield: 4 servings.\nFEED ME
1816063	Brown, Slice, Brown, Sauce	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E0DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	PORK tenderloin, like its relative the beef tenderloin (sometimes called filet mignon), is among the leanest cuts of meat. Its versatility, ease of cooking and eating -- there are no bones and essentially no fat -- and relatively low price have made it popular.\nBut the lack of fat means a lack of flavor. It also means that if you cook the meat to well-done, as one typically does with pork, it tends to dry out.\nThere are a number of ways to cope with these challenges, including wrapping medallions in bacon and roasting the whole tenderloin in a flavorful coating. But a friend has come up with a new one.\nIn a Paris bistro he was served medallions that had been broiled and then sauced. They were good, he reported, but the unbrowned sides were unattractive.\n''I thought that if I cooked the entire cut and got it crisp on the outside, then cut the meat into steaks and browned them on their 'faces,' I'd get even better results,'' he said. ''And indeed mine were much better.''\nTo follow his lead: Brown the whole tenderloin (usually about the right amount for four people). Let it rest for a few minutes, so the meat firms up a bit. Then slice the tenderloin into medallions, about an inch thick. Brown the slices on both sides and build a sauce in the pan.\nI've chosen a simple French-style cream reduction, but you can take the sauce in any direction you like. The relatively bland flavor of the meat will take to almost anything.\nTwice-Cooked Pork Tenderloin Time: 25 minutes\n1 boneless pork tenderloin, about 1 pound Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons butter, extra virgin olive oil, or a combination\n1/4 cup cream 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, lemon juice or Calvados, optional Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish, optional.\n1. Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper. Put a large skillet over medium-high heat; a minute later add 2 tablespoons butter and/or oil. When butter foam subsides or oil dimples, add meat (curve it into skillet if necessary). Brown it well on all sides, for a total of 4 to 6 minutes. Turn off heat, remove meat from pan, and let it sit on a board. When skillet has cooled a bit, proceed. 2. Cut meat into inch-thick slices. Once again turn heat to medium-high, add remaining butter and/or oil and, when it's hot, add pork slices to pan. Brown on each side, about 2 or 3 minutes each. Turn heat to low and remove meat to a warm platter. 3. Add 1/2 cup water to pan, turn heat to high, and cook, stirring and scraping, for a minute. Lower heat slightly, add cream and cook until slightly thickened. Stir in mustard, lemon juice or Calvados, if you're using them, then taste and adjust seasoning. Serve meat with sauce spooned on top, garnished, if you like, with parsley.\nYield: 4 servings.\nTHE MINIMALIST
1816064	Be It Ever So Homespun, There's Nothing Like Spin	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E0DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	SOMETHING made me uneasy when I dropped a box of gluten-free EnviroKidz organic Koala Crisp cereal in my shopping cart. But it's hard to suspect a cartoon koala, so I moved on.\nThe unsettling sensation came back when I bought a bag of my favorite organic frozen French fries. Why did the verdant fields in the Cascadian Farm logo make me feel so smug?\nThen I got really suspicious. A bag of natural Cheetos seemed so much more appealing than the classic cheese puff. Why? Was it the image of a subdued Chester Cheetah rising gently from a farm field bathed in golden sunlight?\nLike clues to a murder that suddenly point to a single culprit, the mystery in my shopping cart revealed itself. Wheat sheaf by wheat sheaf, sunrise by sunrise, the grocery store shelves had been greenwashed.\nAnd I was falling for it.\nThe kind of greenwashing I'm talking about is not just a fake environmental ethos. Greenwashing, it seems to me, can also describe a pervasive genre of food packaging designed to make sure that manufacturers grab their slice of the $25 billion that American shoppers spend each year on natural or organic food.\nAs a design shorthand, it makes subtle use of specific colors, images, typefaces and the promise of what marketers call ''an authentic narrative'' to sell food. Especially in recent years, greenwashing has spilled out well past the organic section of the grocery store. Even the snack aisle at the gas station isn't immune.\n''Somebody becomes successful with a specific point of view, and the consumer begins to identify with it and it spreads like a virus,'' said Paula Scher, a partner in Pentagram, an international design firm. From there it's only a matter of time before Cap'n Crunch shows up in a hemp jacket, raising money to save the manatees.\nBuy a greenwashed product and you're buying a specific set of healthy environmental and socially correct values.\nIf the package does its work, then the food inside doesn't actually have to be organic, only organic-ish. The right cues on a package free mass-market consumers from doing any homework, said Elizabeth Talerman, a branding analyst. They can assume that a group she calls the green elite -- those early adopters who pushed for organic food laws and who helped make Whole Foods markets a success -- have done the work for them.\n''The mass market wants an instant identifier,'' said Ms. Talerman, a longtime New York advertising consultant.\nSo what are the identifiers? After shopping for dozens of products in places as varied as food co-ops and convenience stores, I've uncovered the essential elements of a greenwashed product. Start with a gentle image of a field or a farm to suggest an ample harvest gathered by an honest, hard-working family. To that end, strangely oversize vegetables or fruits are good. If they are dew-kissed and nestled in a basket, all the better. A little red tractor is O.K. Pesticide tanks and rows of immigrant farm laborers bent over in the hot sun are not.\nEarth's Best, a baby and toddler food company, offers a delicious example. Its whole grain rice cereal features two babies working the rice fields. One is white and one is black. (A greenwashed package would never show the black child working in the fields alone.) A sign that looks hand-hewn declares ''No GMO's.'' There is a barn, a butterfly and a typeface that could have come from the back room of a general store.\nA good greenwashed product should show an animal displaying special skills or great emotional range. Some Organic Valley packages feature a sax-playing, environmentally friendly earthworm. Jaunty cows on Stonyfield Farm yogurt wear sunglasses and headbands. The cows on Horizon's milk cartons dance a bovine jig, despite challenges by organic purists that some Horizon cows see precious little pasture.\nA little family history helps, too. My Family Farm of Fort Thomas, Ky., sells packaged cookies and crackers and promises to give some of the money to charity. On the back of the box is a story that begins, ''With careers as licensed social workers, my sister and I are committed to improving the lives of children.'' A carton of Country Hen omega-3 eggs, which cost $3.69 for six, had a fuzzy black-and-white photograph inside showing the company's owner, George Bass, and the entire Country Hen family, along with their favorite eggnog recipe.\nA cause is important. Nature's Path, the maker of Koala Crisp, promises that 1 percent of sales will be spent saving endangered species. Barbara's Bakery, maker of Puffins cereal, pays for the National Audubon Society's live ''puffin cams'' in the Gulf of Maine. Buy a box of Peace Cereal's raspberry ginger crisp, and a percentage of the profit helps pay for International Peace Prayer Day in New Mexico.\nThe actual health benefits of a product don't always matter. A package of organic Naturepops from College Farm shows a field of lollipops and a barn, suggesting a well-educated farmer tending her candy. The sugar might come from cane juice and tapioca syrup, but it's sugar just the same.\nAnd although ''organic'' is losing its power as a code word for certain cultural values, it doesn't hurt to flaunt it if you've got it. The word appears 21 times on a box of Cascadian Farm Vanilla Almond Crunch.\nHaving established a design paradigm that succeeds in selling food that is often more expensive than conventional groceries, the design world should perhaps rejoice. This is not the case. Some top brand and package designers find the cartoonish animals and bad hippie typefaces as grating as a self-righteous vegan at a barbecue.\nBut then, they didn't like American food package design that much to begin with.\n''It's the bottom of the barrel,'' said Ms. Scher, who works in the New York office of Pentagram design.\nRiskier designs, like the clean lettering and curvy bottle of Pom Wonderful pomegranate juice, are rare. Food manufacturers usually agonize over changing the size of a box or shifting the background color from teal to aquamarine.\nBut when a trend starts to show success, it's a design pileup. That's what happened with the natural and organic category, which makes up about 10 percent of the food at the grocery store and has been growing by more than 20 percent a year since 2000. In the grocery business, a 4 percent jump is considered a victory.\n''It's aisle after aisle of design desperation,'' said Brian Collins, chairman and chief creative officer of the design group at Ogilvy, the international advertising and public relations company. He called the look ''phony naïveté'' and predicted that its demise was close because consumers are wising up. There is value in telling a story, but it must be true, he said.\nMerely dressing up the package is not enough, he said. Nonetheless, manufacturers are eager to project a wholesome image.\n''It's the halo effect,'' said Caren Wilcox, executive director of the Organic Trade Association. ''That's why we encourage consumers to look for the U.S.D.A. organic seal.''\nBut even the organic seal doesn't necessarily offer assurances that the item is produced in a way that jibes with consumer expectations for something that comes in a greenwashed package.\n''All the ingredients being used in items with the organic seal are produced using the organic system,'' Ms. Wilcox said. ''It doesn't mean they don't sometimes end up in products some people think other people shouldn't eat.''\nDesign and packaging experts fix the start of sincerity and authenticity in food package design in the 1970s. Mo Siegel began selling Celestial Seasonings tea in boxes with sleepy bears. Tom and Kate Chappell gave up the corporate life to create Tom's of Maine toothpaste. Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield sold ice cream in Vermont, using goofy hand-rendered graphics to tell their story.\nThe trend grew in the 1980s, when corporate America entered a noncorporate phase. ''Companies began to try to not look like big companies,'' Ms. Scher said.\nBy the late 1990s, anything with a hint of natural organic goodness sold in big numbers. Today, many companies that started with a humble story line have been purchased by larger interests. Unilever owns Ben and Jerry's, the Hain Celestial Group is traded on Nasdaq and Tom's of Maine is controlled by Colgate-Palmolive.\nThe kind of imagery that once marked a brand as an alternative to corporate food conglomerates has now been incorporated into Lay's potato chips. Consumers can buy classic Lay's in the shiny yellow bag, or Natural Lay's, with a thicker cut, expeller-pressed oil and sea salt. The package has a brown harvest graphic design, old-timey typefaces and a matte bag. The natural chips cost about 10 cents an ounce more than the classics. A handful of either still offers 150 calories and 10 grams of fat.\n''When it gets to Lay's,'' Ms. Scher said, ''its time to change.''\nMs. Talerman, the New York advertising consultant, predicted that the fascination with what she called the green identifiers will last about five years longer. Then, she said, green-elite food consumers will push companies for even more information about environmental impact, labor practices and community involvement, and mass market consumers will start reading labels instead of just searching out easy identifiers.\nFood manufacturers might begin to copy the new nutrition-style labels that Timberland is putting on its shoe boxes. Each one lists the amount of energy it took to make the shoes, how much of that was renewable, whether child labor was used and how many hours per pair Timberland dedicated to community service.\n''As soon as the mass market starts to understand these issues more,'' Ms. Talerman predicted, ''we'll get away from the fields and the giant vegetables and get back to better design.''\nIt's More or Less Natural, And It's Getting Bigger by the Day\nEACH year grocery manufacturers roll out tens of thousands of products, ever hopeful that a new box of crackers or a frozen entree will be a hit with consumers.\nIn 2006, 17,779 food products were introduced, according to Mintel International, a market research company. That's a jump of almost 2,000 items over the previous year.\nOf those products, 3,761 either were organic or had an all-natural claim on the label.\n''It seems now that everybody is getting into organics,'' said Lynn Dornblaser, a new-products industry analyst at Mintel. She predicted that in 2007, a shakedown will occur in the organic industry as its products become accessible to larger numbers of people. One key indicator of this shift is that Wal-Mart is selling organic products for less money than many competitors.\nOther fast-growing categories last year were baby food, with 116 new products, and ready-to-eat meals or meal-replacement products, with 1,125 items, up from 791 in 2005.\nDesserts, ice cream and candy came out at a healthy clip, but fruits and vegetables were not so lucky. The number of new products in that category dropped by 13 percent.\n''We're also seeing more of a focus on authentically ethnic foods,'' Ms. Dornblaser said. ''It's not just pasta sauce: it's pasta sauce from Tuscany.'' Indian food, in particular, is beginning to catch on. Although the numbers are small -- only 143 new Indian food items appeared last year -- the figure is almost double the number brought out the year before.\nKIM SEVERSON
1816065	Music And Food? The Pros Step In	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E0DE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	DREW NIEPORENT still remembers the afternoon in the 1970s when Warner LeRoy ordered him to turn off the Barbra Streisand eight-track.\nMr. Nieporent, who today operates restaurants from Louisville to London, was tending the bar for Mr. LeRoy at Maxwell's Plum on the Upper East Side. He cued up the Streisand tape every day at lunch. It's no longer clear if it was the warble of the tape or of ''Evergreen'' that set Mr. LeRoy off, but he ordered the eight-track turned off and pronounced that from that moment on, music was forever banned during lunch at Maxwell's Plum.\nSilent, strident or Streisand, there's no consensus on what should play on the dining room hi-fi. Without an easy recipe for success, chefs and restaurateurs turn to consultants, D.J.'s, enthusiastic staff members and their own record collections, seeking a mix that works.\n''Music in restaurants is a sore issue in general,'' said Andrew Carmellini, who, when he's not manning the stoves at A Voce, is working on his second recording with his band, the Crown. ''Pre-opening, I thought my list was brilliant,'' he said. ''But you name the complaint -- the jazz is too boring, the horns are too shrill, there's too much bass -- and we've gotten it.''\nMany restaurateurs try to avoid such complaints by seeking professional help. Food service establishments make up ''a significant portion'' of the 400,000 locations into which Muzak pipes music, according to Karen Vigeland, a company spokeswoman. The bulk of those are quick-service places, but Muzak's roster also includes more elite clients, like 'Wichcraft, the sandwich chain Tom Colicchio has an interest in; Dean & DeLuca's cafes; and Emeril Lagasse's restaurants. (Apologies to anyone who had illusions that Doc Gibbs, Mr. Lagasse's musical sidekick on ''Emeril Live,'' is selecting the discs at Emeril's.)\nMany of Muzak's clients purchase one of the company's 90 or so ''core programs,'' themed mixes with titles like ''Rock Show'' or ''Concrete Beats,'' each of which is about 1,200 songs long. For others, the company generates custom soundtracks, which may be a core program with advertising spliced in (touting breakfast sandwich deals in the morning, for example) or a mix that's tailored to a restaurant's particular vibe.\nPart of the appeal of services like Muzak or Digital Music Xperience, another large music consulting firm, is that they make life easier: No iPods to lose, no CDs to scratch. The bulk of Muzak's customers stream the company's musical feed over the Internet or through a satellite dish.\nJeremy Abrams, managing partner of the New York-based music consulting company Audiostiles, said that a large percentage of his clients come to him from the larger companies ''looking for something a little more customized and up-to-date.'' Daniel Boulud's restaurant group, Dinex, left Muzak three years ago to become Audiostiles's first restaurant client. Since then, Thomas Keller's restaurants in New York, California and Las Vegas, and the Four Seasons hotel group have signed on.\nMr. Abrams said he tailors playlists to the time of the day they'll be heard. To determine exactly what will work for each place, he polls clients on the tempos and genres they want, asking them whether they prefer instrumentals or vocals, new music or something familiar.\nSome restaurants, looking for an even more intimate approach, turn to D.J.'s. Nemo Librizzi started out choosing the music for the restaurants at the Maritime Hotel and has since added Barbuto, Employees Only, Thor and more to his roster.\nDescribing himself as the kind of guy who shows up to meetings without business cards or much of a plan, he said: ''I like to tell clients that they can have me come in and do a mix for them for a few thousand dollars, but that's like an off-the-rack suit, like buying music by the yard. I prefer to do multiple fittings, to tailor the music after hearing feedback from the staff.''\nHis basic strategy might include ''a little jazzy after work music'' for the cocktail hour and late-night montages in which he will slip samples of Jack Kerouac reading from ''On the Road'' between cuts of pygmy music.\n''Sometimes when I look at a place I hear this kind of music being played,'' he said. ''Certain music likes to live in certain rooms. I don't understand it. It's like magic.''\nMuzak or magic, some restaurateurs can't abide the thought of having an outsider select a soundtrack. ''Just like I wouldn't outsource one of my restaurants' wine lists, I would never outsource the music,'' said Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group operates nine venues in New York.\nBoth Mr. Nieporent and Mr. Meyer rely on managers to fine-tune the mix. ''Getting it right is a function of watching the guests,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''In a restaurant setting, music is a little like air-conditioning -- no one's going to tell you when the air-conditioning is perfect, but when it is, the conversations in the room will be more energetic.'' (Digital Music Xperience developed a high-tech system to manage the Panera Bread chain's ''aural strategy'' -- the music -- with microphones in the ceilings of the company's stores that measure noise level in the room and adjust the volume of the music accordingly.)\nSometimes the music program is a group effort. Gabriel Stulman, who owns the Little Owl with the chef Joey Campanaro, said the eclectic mix of music played there is ''mine, Joey's, the servers and all.'' Sometimes it's a solo show: regulars at Babbo are accustomed to having plates of black spaghetti with rock shrimp served with an audible side of whatever Mario Batali likes, as loud as he likes, whenever he likes. (These days his iPod is more likely to be dishing up the plaintive croon of Michael Stipe than the mix of Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix that dominated the restaurant's dining room in its early years.)\nAt the Great Jones Cafe in NoHo, the manager, Bill Judkins, stocks the restaurant's jukebox with seven-inch singles from his own personal and obsessively manicured collection. On Dec. 26, he replaced part of the jukebox's holiday lineup with a selection of James Brown and James Brown side project records, to honor the Godfather of Soul.\nBut not all restaurant folks have 45s of ''Hot Pants'' at their fingertips. Some even choose the most radical soundtrack of all.\nGrant Achatz, the chef of Alinea in Chicago, says he has ''great appreciation for but limited knowledge'' of music, and that that is one reason he has chosen not to play any in his dining rooms.\nBeyond that, he said, he has not yet found a way to match the acoustics to the food in a restaurant full of people, each of them at different points in his lengthy tasting menus. He did experiment with speakers above each table that would deploy ''audio spotlight'' technology, which can project a very precise beam of sound into a narrowly delineated area. But the noises bounced off the hardwood tabletops and reverberated throughout the space. Hearing a crunch during a creamy course, he said, just didn't seem right.\nThe system, he said, is ''back on the drawing board'' for now. And until that changes, his customers will just have to eat Mr. Achatz's ''white truffle explosion'' to the sounds of silence.\nCorrection: January 10, 2007, Wednesday An article last week about music in restaurants misstated the relationship between Muzak and 'Wichcraft restaurants. Muzak provided stereo equipment for a 'Wichcraft restaurant in San Francisco. It does not provide the chain with recorded music.\nCorrection: January 15, 2007, Monday An article in Thursday Styles on Dec. 7 about holiday music in retail stores and an article in Dining on Jan. 3 about the debate over playing music in restaurants misstated the name of a music consulting company that sells audio systems and programming to such businesses. It is DMX -- not Digital Music Express or Digital Music Xperience.
1816066	Annie Leibovitz Gets Her Close-Up (No Need for Touch-Ups)	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05EFDE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	''Annie Leibovitz: Life Through a Lens,'' which makes its debut on PBS tonight, reminds us how profoundly American culture values branding, not only from software packagers and congressional candidates but also from artists high and low. Just as a Whopper can be confused with no other hamburger, Ms. Leibovitz's photographs of the beloved and ignominious are virtually impossible to mistake for someone else's. Her work raises interesting questions about the primacy of creative signature -- to what extent should we consider distinctiveness its own merit? But the failure of ''Life Through a Lens'' is its refusal to embark on this inquiry at all.\nPart of the ''American Masters'' series, this documentary is in the business of reverence. Made by Ms. Leibovitz's younger sister, Barbara, it speaks to a sibling relationship seemingly devoid of envy or petty resentment. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jann Wenner are just a few of the commentators summoned to speak glowingly of Ms. Leibovitz's achievements. It was Mr. Wenner who first gave Ms. Leibovitz free rein in the early days of Rolling Stone, of which there is wonderful footage here. An early break for her came when the magazine ran pages of her pictures documenting Nixon leaving the White House. (A big Watergate article by Hunter S. Thompson had been scheduled, but he never got around to finishing it.)\nFor the last two decades, Ms. Leibovitz has primarily worked for Vanity Fair, and the celebrities she photographs see her as belonging to their own class, or even above it. For instance, Whoopi Goldberg recalls the jittery, I'm-not-worthy feelings she experienced in advance of a meeting with Ms. Leibovitz that resulted in a famous portrait of Ms. Goldberg emerging from a bathtub full of milk.\nSeemingly, anyone who has ever stood in front of Ms. Leibovitz's camera takes a very favorable view of her. While Ms. Leibovitz may be a surpassingly warm and engaging human being, it is more likely that she is adored because she adores. Ms. Leibovitz has a great deal of fun with her camera but never biting, seditious fun. Her pictures do not denigrate or disparage. Instead they document the celebrity circus with an acutely literal vision, submitting the famous to playfully acrobatic postures and various acts of clownishness.\nProfilers and portraitists are not generally among society's most forthcoming, and so it is refreshing to witness Ms. Leibovitz speak openly about her life. The film partly follows her through the process of putting together her recent book, ''A Photographer's Life, 1990-2005,'' which includes moving photographs of her family members and her last days with her partner, Susan Sontag, who died of cancer two years ago.\nIt was Sontag, Ms. Leibovitz explains, who drove her to greater ambition, who prodded her to produce work that would matter. If there is reason to revere Ms. Leibovitz, it is that she heeded the call.\nAmerican Masters Annie Leibovitz: Life Through a Lens On most PBS stations tonight (check local listings).\nDirected by Barbara Leibovitz; Susan Lacy, series executive producer.

1816067	From Sex Trade To Vultures: Asia Outside In	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06EFDE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Film Forum's omnibus of work by the writer-director-cinematographer-editor Ellen Bruno covers a spectrum of Asian subjects. The 50-minute featurette ''Sacrifice'' depicts young Burmese girls conscripted into prostitution in Thailand; the bill also includes shorts about a village of Nepalese lepers and a Tibetan monastery where ''body breakers'' feed the stripped flesh and ground bones of the dead to giant vultures.\nBut nonfiction doesn't quite describe what Ms. Bruno does. Her work takes risks with form to imply that individual suffering and transcendence are but particles in a river of spiritual energy that dwarfs geography and time.\nMs. Bruno's attempts to realize this vision don't always come off. ''Sacrifice'' pushes too hard, employing impressionistic slow motion and a free-floating monologue that occasionally suggests ''Born Into Brothels'' by way of ''Hiroshima Mon Amour.'' The movie is more compelling when it's listening to lifelong sex workers describe the friendships and rituals that make life bearable.\nBut the two shorts achieve Ms. Bruno's aim, deploying surprisingly timed cuts and continuous sound elements (chants, barking dogs, desolate wind) to mimic a trancelike state. The straightforward interviews in ''Leper'' are enclosed by wordless, plainly beautiful images of life in a marginalized village.\nIn ''Sky Burial,'' Ms. Bruno's camera lingers on backpacks containing corpses lugged up into the mountains; it's as if those packs contain not dead flesh, but living spirits.\nSacrifice, Leper and Sky Burial Opens today in Manhattan.\nThree films written, directed, photographed and edited by Ellen Bruno: ''Sacrifice'' (in English, Burmese and Thai, with English subtitles); ''Leper'' (in Nepali, with English subtitles); and ''Sky Burial'' (in Tibetan, with English subtitles).

1816068	In Croatia, An Empty Life In Full View	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801EFDE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	''I Love You,'' a bleak drama from the Croatian writer and director Dalibor Matanic, is an unusually perceptive scrutiny of absence and emptiness. Set in the filmmaker's hometown, Zagreb, the movie follows a young advertising hotshot named Kreso (Kresimir Mikic), whose life is a thoughtless round of drinking, drugs and sex. When he gets into trouble, his lawyer father bails him out; when he is lonely, his gym buddies are preferable to the live-in girlfriend he barely speaks to. Then he learns he is H.I.V.-positive.\nCountering an admittedly trite premise -- personal growth through unexpected adversity -- with an atmosphere of haunting sterility, Mr. Matanic and his cinematographer, Branko Linta, wash the screen in the palest of grays, infused with mutating pastels. As Kreso's life is stripped away (''The company has to be clean, both inside and out,'' says his unrepentant boss as he shows him the door), Kreso's surroundings appear increasingly insubstantial and his connections with others more raw and violent. It is a furiously unsympathetic role, and Mr. Mikic -- a lean Adrien Brody look-alike -- tackles it with compelling urgency.\nOpening and closing beneath the clinical glare of hospital lights, ''I Love You'' conjures a disaffected post-Communist life of casual hedonism and emotional bankruptcy. In its simple, unforced way, the movie is as much about the loss of a generation as the redemption of an individual.\nI Love You (Volim Te) Opens today in Manhattan.\nWritten (in Croatian, with English subtitles) and directed by Dalibor Matanic; director of photography, Branko Linta; edited by Tomislav Pavlic; music by Jura Ferina and Pavle Miholjevic; produced by Mario Oreskovic; released by the Doors Art Foundation.

1816069	MoMA to Gain Exhibition Space by Selling Adjacent Lot for $125 Million	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00EFDE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Capitalizing on Manhattan's robust real estate prices, the Museum of Modern Art is selling its last vacant parcel of land in Midtown for $125 million to Hines, an international real estate developer based in Houston, the museum's director said yesterday.\nAs part of the deal Hines is to construct a mixed-use building on West 54th Street that will connect to the museum's second- , fourth- and fifth-floor galleries, said the director, Glenn D. Lowry. He said the project would afford about 50,000 square feet of additional exhibition space for the Modern's painting and sculpture collections.\nA Hines spokesman said it was too early to say what the building's other uses would be.\nThe property is one of several the Modern acquired during the last decade in mapping out an ambitious expansion. A glass-and-steel addition designed by the architect Yoshio Taniguchi was completed in November 2004.\nHines also plans to provide about 10,000 square feet in the new building's basement for museum storage.\nAfter construction expenses for the new galleries are covered, the Modern estimates that some $65 million will go to its $650 million endowment.\n''This is a Christmas present,'' Mr. Lowry said. ''It's a tremendous boon to enhancing what is already an extraordinary collection.'' The 10 percent addition to the endowment will go toward caring for the collections and acquisitions. No firm timetable for construction has been set, he added, but he estimated that completion of the new building was at least five years away.\nIn 1996 the museum bought the Dorset Hotel, a 19-story building from the 1920s next door on West 54th Street, along with two adjacent brownstones in a $50 million transaction. Much of that land was used for Mr. Taniguchi's addition. That expansion, including an increase in MoMA's endowment to cover operating expenses, cost $858 million in total.\nThe museum also quietly purchased other parcels on West 54th Street, including what had been the City Athletic Club, a brownstone and a sliver building next door.\nOver the years, Mr. Lowry said, the museum has been inundated with offers from developers interested in buying the land, but did not seriously consider selling until recently.\n''But as the market went into overdrive it seemed like the right move to make,'' he said. The Modern put out the word that it was open to offers and the response was overwhelming.\nHines was the highest bidder, Mr. Lowry said. ''We ultimately settled on Hines because of its financial offer and because it has a good reputation for working with architects,'' Mr. Lowry said. He added that no architect had been selected to design the new building or the Modern's additional galleries.\nWhen Mr. Tanaguchi conceived his design he took into consideration a possible future expansion to the west, Mr. Lowry said, making it structurally easy to break through to what will be the new building and extend each of the three gallery floors by about 17,000 square feet.\nJerry I. Speyer, a Modern trustee and real estate developer who is president and chief executive of Tishman Speyer, helped negotiate the sale. (He was instrumental in the purchase of the Dorset Hotel, too.)\n''The museum is not in the real estate business, but in the business of showing art, collecting art and educating people about art,'' Mr. Speyer said. ''Because of the figuration of the land, there was a limit to the amount of space we could use for galleries.''\nHe said that the entire board agreed that now was the time to act. ''Everyone felt great about the decision,'' he said of the sale. ''There were no issues in anyone's mind.''\nThe parcel as a whole consists of about 200,000 square feet of buildable space, Mr. Lowry said.\nThe addition also opens the way for the museum to address wide criticism of the exhibition spaces in the Taniguchi building. When the Modern reopened in 2004 many faulted its curators for showing fewer artworks in its expanded galleries than it had before.\n''The goal has always been to display the collection better,'' Mr. Lowry said. Responding to the criticism, he said the display of art in the museum's previous incarnation was ''overly dense,'' which people felt was ''too much like a textbook.''\nTrying to anticipate the museum's needs for contemporary art display is not easy. Mr. Lowry said the new galleries would be designed to be flexible.\n''We envision them to include space that will deal with the unanticipated changes of the future,'' he said.\nAnd whereas MoMA had to close its doors on West 54th Street during the 2002-04 building project, operating a temporary museum in Queens, Mr. Lowry said that would not be necessary this time.\n''The construction of these galleries will not entail closing the museum again,'' he said.
1816070	Hot-Button Controversy Rules Oscar Contenders	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502EFDE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	''I didn't go there to make a point,'' said Laura Poitras, a documentary filmmaker, about traveling in Iraq to make ''My Country, My Country,'' one of four documentaries about the war contending for Oscar nominations this year.\n''I don't think I would risk my life to make a point,'' she added, seated in her comfortable TriBeCa office early last month. ''But I did feel it was important to understand this war -- and to document it -- and I didn't think that the mass media was going to do it.''\nMs. Poitras, 42, used her own camera and recorded sound herself as she followed an Iraqi physician for eight months. An outspoken Sunni critic of the American occupation, he was seeking a seat on the Baghdad Provincial Council during the national elections in January 2005, but did not win.\n''My Country, My Country'' may not capture the best-documentary Oscar, or even be selected as one of the five nominees, to be announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Jan. 23. (The awards ceremony is on Feb. 25.) But its presence on the highly competitive feature-length documentary shortlist -- 14 other films are on that list -- highlights a shift toward gritty, guerrilla filmmaking, a willingness to tackle controversial subjects, no matter the obstacles.\nIssue-oriented documentaries dominate the shortlist, chosen by the 138 members of the documentary branch of the academy. Eighty-one films met the eligibility requirements; of those, the members who voted selected 15 and will further narrow the field to the 5 nominees.\n''This is the year of the angry documentary, of the 'Take back America' documentary,'' Sheila Nevins, president of HBO Documentary Films, said in a telephone interview. ''The theatrical documentary,'' she added, ''has replaced the television documentary in terms of talking back to the administration. That's one of the only places where one can do it.''\nBut one pioneering filmmaker, Albert Maysles, did not seem enthusiastic about the trend. ''I am a strong advocate of distancing oneself from a point of view,'' he said recently. ''What is good for the documentary world in 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' '' -- Michael Moore's 2004 film -- ''is that Michael's heart was in the right place'' for viewers who agreed with him, he said. ''But he damages his cause because he is out to get people. He's using people in a nonloving fashion to serve the purpose of his argument. If what you think is correct, what do you have to fear in telling the full story?''\nStanley Nelson, the director of another shortlisted film, ''Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple,'' said that while Mr. Moore was ''over the top,'' his work occupied a significant position within the genre. Speaking at an Upper West Side coffee shop, Mr. Nelson said, ''What's fascinating about documentary today is the different ways to approach it.''\nReferring to his own film about Jim Jones, who led the mass suicide in which more than 900 people died in Guyana in 1978, Mr. Nelson said: ''It was essential for us not to say that this guy was only evil. Just by being somewhat objective, we were being revolutionary.''\nMr. Nelson's comment reflects a climate in which the pursuit of objectivity in documentaries is hardly the norm, as it had been during the 1950s and '60s. In that period, American filmmakers like Mr. Maysles advocated ''direct cinema,'' where the camera was thought of as a fly on the wall, capturing but not commenting on life. Still, some of the shortlisted documentaries adopt this approach more than others in treating subjects like these:\nGlobal warming: Davis Guggenheim's box office hit, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' with former Vice President Al Gore.\nReligion: Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing's ''Jesus Camp,'' about born-again Christian children at an evangelical summer camp in North Dakota; Amy Berg's ''Deliver Us From Evil,'' about Oliver O'Grady, a former priest and convicted pedophile; and Mr. Nelson's film about Jim Jones.\nRace: Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's ''Trials of Darryl Hunt,'' about a wrongly convicted African-American man.\nFree speech: Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's ''Shut Up & Sing,'' on the fallout after Natalie Maines, of the Dixie Chicks, publicly criticized President Bush on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nThe political campaign process: Frank Popper's ''Can Mr. Smith Get to Washington Anymore?,'' which follows the 2004 grass-roots campaign of Jeff Smith, a Missouri Democrat, for Congress.\nThe two-party political system: Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan's ''Unreasonable Man,'' a profile of Ralph Nader.\nIn addition to Ms. Poitras's film, the three other shortlisted documentaries on the Iraq war are James Longley's ''Iraq in Fragments,'' Deborah Scranton's ''War Tapes'' and Patricia Foulkrod's ''Ground Truth.''\nMs. Kopple, a two-time Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker who once worked for Mr. Maysles, said more people were seeing documentaries because they wanted to watch passionate stories about unforgettable characters.\n''Audiences are smart enough to decide for themselves if they agree with the point of view onscreen,'' she said. ''I'm not sure that 'distance' is a positive thing in nonfiction filmmaking. I think there's a time and place for distance; in television journalism, for example.''\nShe agreed with Mr. Maysles about letting a story unfold naturally. ''The most important factor, in my opinion,'' she said, ''is not do we grow too close to our subjects, it's are we willing to go on a journey with them that may not end up as we first envisioned it?''\nOne director who took such a journey was Mr. Guggenheim with ''An Inconvenient Truth.'' Speaking from Los Angeles, he recalled the beginning of his own transformation after watching a presentation by Mr. Gore on climate change, which became the centerpiece of the film.\n''All movies are personal,'' Mr. Guggenheim said. ''When I make a movie, I don't have activism in mind; I have an experience in mind. Before I saw Al's slide show, I was not an environmentalist. But when I saw it, it shook me to the core.''\nIn a telephone conversation in New York with Ms. Ewing and Ms. Grady, the directors of ''Jesus Camp,'' Ms. Grady said their film was as ''balanced as humanly possible for us.''\n''It's unattainable to have no point of view at all,'' she said. ''We're human, and we did the best we could.''\nWith its concentration on national politics, the academy passed over a clutch of well-made films that in other years might have fared better: for example, Christopher Quinn's ''God Grew Tired of Us: The Story of the Lost Boys of Sudan''; Doug Block's ''51 Birch Street,'' an exploration into the lives of his parents; and Ward Serrill's ''Heart of the Game,'' about girls' basketball.\nSimilarly, the three remaining shortlisted movies, all set in foreign countries other than Iraq, may face an uphill battle. They are Lucy Walker's ''Blindsight,'' about six blind Tibetan children; Yael Klopmann's ''Storm of Emotions,'' about the Israeli pullout from the Gaza Strip; and Kim Longinotto and Florence Ayisi's ''Sisters in Law,'' a profile of two Cameroon women -- a judge and a prosecutor -- fighting for women's rights.\nHowever the academy members vote, Ms. Poitras said she already considered ''My Country, My Country'' successful. She cited a scene she had shot at the Abu Ghraib detention center: a 9-year-old Iraqi boy is being held for some unspecified reason by American Army officers who call him a dangerous juvenile. Moments such as these, she said, ''will bring a sense of questioning and shame about some of the things we are doing in Iraq.''\nSo even a filmmaker like Ms. Poitras, who by her own account employed a subtle and patient approach, may have made a point after all. In the current climate for documentaries, she certainly is not alone.
1816071	Hey! Never Underestimate the Average Joe	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	''The King of Queens,'' the longest-running live-action comedy currently on television, is the opposite of an acquired taste. Like pizza or the Doors, the show just hits the spot -- the simple, happy sitcom spot.\nBut you can train yourself to disdain ''The King of Queens.'' Determined viewers have had nearly nine seasons, and a campaign of rerun-saturation so thorough that you might begin to suspect a state sponsor, to muster complaints. They have come up with two. Unable to say it's not funny, detractors say ''The King of Queens'' is unconvincing. Slim, go-getter secretaries like Carrie (Leah Remini) don't marry lugs who drive trucks like Doug (Kevin James), do they? Others don't buy Jerry Stiller as Carrie's dad. He's always George's dad of ''Seinfeld'' to them.\nInside, though, that first conviction doesn't go away. ''The King of Queens,'' which ends this season, now that Mr. James is turning to other pursuits, is funny. It's brisk, perceptive and unpretentious. It works. See for yourself tonight on CBS.\nIn the late 1990s, when writers were taking stock of the would-be new economy, they decided that the back-end of retail -- the part that involved getting merchandise to consumers -- was not obsolete. Whether or not people shopped on the Internet, they still needed a way to get their goods. Warehouses and roads, stockers and drivers.\nThus, in 1998, while Fox and NBC were peddling ''Getting Personal'' and ''Conrad Bloom,'' comedies about front-end figures like art directors and admen, CBS banked on a fat deliveryman. The overgroomed swingers foundered, but ''The King of Queens'' persisted. Its hero, Doug Heffernan (not a relative), worked for a U.P.S.-like company that hasn't gone under.\nWhen that new economy became kind of upsetting, then, and we didn't want to think about it for a while, it was nice that the old economy, with its outer boroughs and its cardboard boxes, could still make us laugh.\n''The King of Queens'' may no longer exemplify a cultural trend. But people watch it. According to CBS, 8.7 million viewers tune in each week. After tonight's episode, the series goes on hiatus until April 9; it's expected to do as well or better for its seven valedictory episodes.\nJust as ''The Pilgrim's Progress'' begins when the everyman comes upon a book, ''The King of Queens'' begins when Doug comes across a television set. That anachronism, a pre-digital, 70-inch technology coffin, is intended for enshrinement in Doug's basement in the series's pilot episode. He hopes it will attract his slobby friends to the rec room for sports viewing and dissipation. But Arthur Spooner (Mr. Stiller), Doug's father-in-law, shows up to wreck the plan when his house burns down.\nDoug adapts, but Arthur's arrival is this comedy's original sin. Anyone who suggests that it's Carrie who gets the raw deal in the marriage is not thinking straight. As far as I'm concerned, the spouse who brings a parent into the marital home puts everything in hock to the other spouse, and must spend a lifetime paying for it.\n''The King of Queens'' and I are in agreement, and the moral imbalance of the show -- Carrie's presumption in allowing Arthur to stay -- compromises her hard-won authority. Yeah, she's trim, organized and snippy, with the makeup, the Manhattan job and the shopaholism, but she's also the one in the couple who can't really grow up because she lives with her dad. She's irritated with Doug because she feels obliged to him for accommodating her regression, and the series has found humor in this conflict at every turn.\nOn a recent episode, Carrie tries to pass off a frosted sofa cushion as a homemade cake. Not being able to contribute baked goods for a church auction -- and be ''wife-ish,'' in Doug's nice neologism -- seems at first trivial. But Ms. Remini manages to keep Carrie stubbornly blind to her incompetence until that incompetence becomes the dark night of her female soul; then she must fake it. Any woman who can't bake will recognize this harrowing arc.\nOn another Carrie-centric episode, she cheats at board games. The Heffernans and their friends decide to have a game night; Carrie wins, and relishes her victory, by subtly cheating. But then she's caught. The everyday foul play is not played as madcap or off-kilter, as it might have been on ''Seinfeld.'' Instead, it comes across as it might if anyone were caught cheating at board games, i.e., utterly humiliating.\nDoug and Carrie are childless (''You're pregnant?'' ''No.'' ''Thank God!'' was dialogue on the pilot), and much speculation about whether they'll have kids has attended this final season. The question may be moot, since the series has always been about the competition between the spouses to grow up. Like many couples who met and married young, Doug and Carrie are learning responsibility and even refinement together, but they also have each other's number -- and any overreaching by one is met with a swift retribution by the other.\nWhich is not to say that they don't, eventually, move on in the world -- socially, psychologically, culturally -- but the progress is slow, and it works by feints and dodges in the marriage.\nThis checkers match to maturity keeps jokes on tap, and it's a reminder of why comedies set among average Joes, who detect a wider range of mockable pretensions, are more durable than ''hip'' comedies, which can really never be hip enough. Also, the imperative to stasis -- not to budge from the couch, the family, the buddies, the neighborhood -- is just funny, and clearly of a piece with the ambition-free practice of television-watching.\nMr. James, a onetime football player from Mineola, N.Y., with a rosy complexion and a reassuring frat-guy voice, is the making of this show. A bravura standup, he writes and acts with easy athleticism. Conspicuously, he lacks the darkness of his friend and occasional collaborator Ray Romano.\nThe dirty secret of his Doug character is that he loves life. The brilliantly senile Arthur, along with Doug's lechy, creepy friend Spence (the pro stand-up Patton Oswalt), present a fair challenge to his frankness and naïveté.\nBut the greatest challenge to Doug's modus vivendi comes from Carrie, and the result is the series's elegant equilibrium. Exuberant, open-book, gluttonous Doug is married to a woman of cosmetics, schemes and guile. His inertia, it turns out, is their shared honesty; but her guile is their ambition, and it's what allows them to keep moving. It's a lovely dynamic. It could almost last forever.\nTELEVISION

1816073	Muslims in the Melting Pot: Portraits of a Post-9/11 World	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01EEDE1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	American Islam The Struggle for the Soul of a Religion By Paul M. Barrett 304 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $25.\nA few weeks ago a conference of accomplished Muslim women gathered at the Westin Hotel near Times Square to debate how women might exert greater influence on the interpretation of Islamic Scriptures. During a panel discussion, an Iranian-born anthropologist from Britain said she seconded the position taken by the Labor politician Jack Straw, that the full facial veils worn by some Muslims have no place in Western society because they erase a woman's humanity.\nThe conference room seemed to sunder in two. Half the roughly 200 women present erupted in energetic applause, while many of the rest made catcalls, heckling the speaker's opinion with lines like, ''Why doesn't he take off his pants?!''\nIn the post-9/11 world Muslims have frequently been stereotyped as monolithically murderous, all 1.3 billion worldwide lumped together as extremists bent on destroying the West. The heated debates among Muslims themselves about violence committed under the banner of Islam are often drowned out in the fray.\nPaul M. Barrett's timely and engaging new book, ''American Islam: The Struggle for the Soul of a Religion,'' brings some of those voices in the United States to life.\nThe book, a series of seven profiles, draws partly from Mr. Barrett's reporting for The Wall Street Journal about Islam in America after the 2001 attacks. (He now works for Business Week.) He sketches a varied cast -- with a pronounced skew toward outspoken moderates -- to try to illustrate the diversity among American Muslims.\nKhaled Abou El Fadl, an Egyptian-born law professor and Islamic scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles, tries to live the moderation he teaches: adopting stray dogs, for example, although many Muslims believe that Scripture condemns dogs as unclean.\nThere is Osama Siblani, a secular Lebanese Shiite in his early 50s who publishes a weekly newspaper in Dearborn, Mich. ''Since 9/11 I have felt choked,'' he tells Mr. Barrett, a common sentiment among Muslims, who often find themselves in the contradictory position of loving the freedom offered by the United States while abhorring the way the federal government treats Muslims here and abroad.\nTo describe the African-American Muslim perspective, Mr. Barrett spent time with Siraj Wahhaj, a charismatic prayer leader who made the rather typical transition from the radicalized Nation of Islam toward more mainstream Sunni Islam. Mr. Wahhaj espouses polygamy and refuses to blame Osama bin Laden for 9/11; African-American Islam, Mr. Barrett writes, ''lacks fully developed leaders.''\n''American Islam'' mentions in passing, but does not analyze, the pronounced rift between immigrant Muslims and African-Americans, who constitute as much as 40 percent of the estimated six million Muslims in the United States. Many African-Americans believe that Arab and Asian immigrants disdain them as insufficiently orthodox, failing to appreciate the inroads they made for Islam.\nThe profiles can be slightly repetitive. We are told several times, for instance, that an unprecedented surge of Muslim newcomers followed the 1965 relaxation in the immigration laws.\nOne chapter describes Asra Nomani, a colleague of Mr. Barrett's from The Wall Street Journal, who made a name for herself partly by attacking the way American mosques demean women. Ms. Nomani also drew widespread attention to extremist sermons and Saudi-financed pamphlets distributed in some of what the book says are 1,300 mosques in the United States. One such pamphlet said Islam encourages a husband to beat his disobedient wife, but gently, without breaking bones or leaving bruises.\n''American Islam'' lacks figures to represent the conservative or the extremist viewpoint -- one difficulty in relying on a series of profiles to illustrate the faith -- and the format doesn't allow for an in-depth assessment of Islamic radicalism in the United States. Mr. Barrett refers to a hot debate over the degree to which the creed of the Wahhabis, the puritanical Saudi Arabian sect hostile to non-Muslims, exists here. But aside from a few swipes by Mr. Wahhaj at democracy, we hear only from critics of extremism.\nIt might have been a problem of access: American Muslims are extremely wary of reporters. They feel they were vilified after 9/11, being considered somehow less than loyal Americans, and fear that talking could attract unwanted attention from law enforcement. If that was the issue, Mr. Barrett doesn't say it.\nThe book does include a sketch of an Indian immigrant who joined the Muslim Brotherhood at the University of Tennessee and rejected all non-Muslims as inferior, but he outgrew his radicalism.\nMr. Barrett also illustrates the failings of the federal government in trying to prosecute suspected Qaeda operatives. He details the case of Sami Omar al-Hussayen, a Saudi computer science graduate student at the University of Idaho accused of supporting terrorism because he helped upload sermons vehemently criticizing the United States.\nThe Justice Department overreached, Mr. Barrett argues, charging Mr. Hussayen with three counts of material support for terrorists, with Attorney General John Ashcroft himself announcing the charges. But the prosecution did not present any statements from Mr. Hussayen supporting terrorism, and he was acquitted.\n''American Islam'' is perhaps reassuring in noting that Muslims in the United States are more prosperous, better educated and more politically active than immigrants elsewhere in the West. They are not ghettoized as in Europe, just stigmatized at this point, and Mr. Barrett's cast implies that there are vigilant Muslims determined to uproot extremists should they try to plant themselves here.\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES
1816074	The Ex-Presidents' Club Bids a Member Goodbye	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E4DD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	In a moment of presidential empathy, former President George Bush recalled a skill he had learned from Gerald R. Ford: how to handle being ridiculed on ''Saturday Night Live.''\n''I remember that lesson well, since being able to laugh at yourself is essential in public life,'' Mr. Bush said in his eulogy for Mr. Ford on Tuesday. ''I'd tell you more about that, but as Dana Carvey would say: 'Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent.' ''\nAs the 82-year-old former president imitated his own impersonator, there were only three people in the audience who knew exactly how it felt to be ridiculed, as a sitting president, on late-night television. Former President Bill Clinton responded with a hearty laugh from his seat in the Washington National Cathedral, while former President Jimmy Carter, in a neighboring pew, looked on with a smile. Seated nearby was President Bush, who has been relentlessly skewered by TV comics as well.\nWith Mr. Ford's death last week, the group of living former presidents has shrunk to three, down from five in the early 1990s. Since 1994, Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and, now, Mr. Ford have left the stage, while Mr. Clinton has joined the ranks of former chief executives.\nThe dynamic among the former presidents is perpetually evolving, as people age, rivalries fade and former political opponents discover they share more similarities than differences.\nThe current club has at its core two presidents in different parties -- Mr. Clinton, 60, and the elder Mr. Bush -- who have become companions in traveling and fund-raising for causes around the world. The two at times appear more friendly than Mr. Bush is with his son, or than Mr. Clinton is with Mr. Carter, 82, a fellow Democrat. And on Tuesday it was Mr. Carter, not either of the Bushes, who accompanied Mr. Ford's coffin back to Grand Rapids, Mich., for burial.\nThough Mr. Ford and Mr. Carter squared off in the 1976 election, they became friends after both were out of office. On a flight home from Cairo in 1981, after the funeral of the Egyptian leader Anwar el-Sadat, they found common ground discussing their presidential libraries.\nSimilar kinship has grown between Mr. Clinton and the first President Bush, in contrast to the rocky relationship between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Carter. Though the two Southern Democrats are from similarly humble backgrounds, they have been at odds repeatedly over the years.\nIn 1993, Mr. Carter said he was ''very disappointed'' in the Clintons for sending their daughter, Chelsea, to private school rather than public school, as the Carters had done with their daughter, Amy. After the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Mr. Carter said he had been ''deeply embarrassed by what occurred.'' In more recent years, the Clinton-Carter relationship has had a tinge of rivalry, as both men have sought to become global statesmen.\nThe funeral also provided a stage for those thinking about the politics of tomorrow, as well as those of yesterday. Along with the three former presidents sat several of those who may aspire to the job, including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio.\nAnd it was a reminder that while the nation elects only the president, the White House becomes home to a whole family whose members have to cope with the spotlight. At the cathedral on Tuesday, Rosalynn Carter was seen talking intently with Nancy Reagan. One row behind them, Chelsea Clinton spoke animatedly with a fellow Stanford University alumna, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\nTom Brokaw, the former NBC News anchor, said in his eulogy that when Mr. Ford brought his family to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, ''he brought the humanity that comes with a family that seemed to be living right next door.''\nFor neighbors of the Fords in Alexandria, Va., from the 1950s until they moved into the White House in 1974, they were in fact the family next door, with four independent-minded children whose public indiscretions Mr. Ford sometimes had to confront.\nHis son Jack admitted in a newspaper interview in 1975 that he smoked marijuana and lived a rowdy bachelor's life. His daughter, Susan Ford Bales, was a headstrong teenager when her father became president and was married for a time to a Secret Service agent who had been assigned to guard the family.\nMr. Ford and Ms. Bales, now middle-aged, walked hand in hand down the center aisle of the cathedral before the service, and each read a passage from the Bible.\nMs. Bales's reading came from James 1:19-25, chosen by the family to help illuminate the former president's humble approach to the bitter times in which he served.\n''Therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness, and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls,'' Ms. Bales read. ''But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves.''\nTHE 38TH PRESIDENT\nCorrection: January 5, 2007, Friday An article on Wednesday about the funeral of former President Gerald R. Ford drew an erroneous comparison between Chelsea Clinton and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who sat next to each other. Ms. Rice received degrees from the University of Denver and Notre Dame. She is not an alumna of Stanford University, where Ms. Clinton received a bachelor's degree. (Ms . Rice is a former Stanford provost.)
1816075	Ford Is Remembered as Bringing 'Grace to a Moment of Great Doubt'	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E3DD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	In a soaring tribute to a modest man, Gerald R. Ford was remembered on Tuesday as bringing the ordinary virtues of decency, integrity and humility to mend a broken government after the pain of war and scandal.\n''Amid all the turmoil, Gerald Ford was a rock of stability,'' President Bush told the gathering of generations of Washington's powerful at Washington National Cathedral. ''And when he put his hand on his family Bible to take the presidential oath of office, he brought grace to a moment of great doubt.''\nThe cathedral's grand setting and the pomp of a state funeral provided a counterpoint for the unassuming character praised by the eulogists.\nPresident Bush's father called Mr. Ford ''a Norman Rockwell painting come to life''; Tom Brokaw, the former television anchor, described ''Citizen Ford'' as a ''champion of Main Street values''; and Henry A. Kissinger said the man he served as secretary of state ''had the virtues of small-town America.''\nWhen the cathedral's limestone arches echoed, it was with the drums and brass of Aaron Copland's ''Fanfare for the Common Man,'' and the ushers directing the capacity crowd of 3,700 to their seats were uniformed Boy Scouts, a tribute to Mr. Ford's youthful achievement of the rank of Eagle Scout. Among the hymns was ''Eternal Father, Strong to Save,'' known as the Navy Hymn, a particular favorite of Mr. Ford, who served in the Pacific during World War II.\nPresident Bush, overseeing a deeply unpopular war in Iraq and perhaps pondering his own legacy, lauded Mr. Ford's ''firm resolve'' in sending the Marines to rescue the crew of the American merchant ship Mayagüez when it was seized by Cambodia. He suggested that some acts widely condemned during Mr. Ford's administration in the 1970s had come to look wiser in historical perspective, including his pardon for his immediate predecessor, Richard M. Nixon.\nIn addition, Mr. Bush noted that Mr. Ford was criticized for signing the Helsinki Accords, the 1975 agreement that ratified borders in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe while also setting new standards for human rights.\n''History has shown that document helped bring down the Soviet Union as courageous men and women behind the Iron Curtain used it to demand their God-given liberties,'' Mr. Bush said.\nMr. Ford's coffin arrived at the cathedral by motorcade from the Capitol, a final journey through the city where he served as 13-term congressman, vice president and finally president, the only person to hold the nation's top two offices without being elected to either.\nAfter the 90-minute Episcopal funeral service, Mr. Ford's body was flown from Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington to his hometown, Grand Rapids, Mich., for a burial service on Wednesday in a plot beside the museum that bears his name.\nIn Washington, the Gothic cathedral where Mr. Ford helped dedicate the nave in 1976, became for the morning a crossroads of the capital's past and present, with Supreme Court justices and members of Congress in the south transept facing scores of foreign ambassadors and former foreign leaders in the north transept.\nAcross an aisle from the diplomats sat Mr. Ford's honorary pallbearers, including in the front row Mr. Kissinger; Donald H. Rumsfeld, who served as defense secretary to both Mr. Ford and the current President Bush; Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chief who was Mr. Ford's top economic adviser; James A. Baker III, who ran Mr. Ford's unsuccessful 1976 campaign for president; and Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Ford's national security adviser.\nFacing the altar, where Mr. Ford's coffin, draped by a flag, sat, were Mr. Ford's widow, Betty, who was escorted in and out of the cathedral by President Bush, and the Ford children, Steve, Jack, Mike and Susan.\nAcross the nave from the Ford family sat President Bush and Laura Bush, and Vice President Dick Cheney, who served Mr. Ford as chief of staff, with his wife, Lynne; several current cabinet members and three former presidents -- the elder Mr. Bush with his wife, Barbara; Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn; and Bill Clinton and his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea. With them was Nancy Reagan, the former first lady.\nLike much of the outpouring of affection for Mr. Ford since he died at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., on Dec. 26 at the age of 93, the service focused on what President Bush called the ''calm and healing'' the former president brought to ''one of the most divisive moments in our nation's history.'' Mr. Ford, the House minority leader, succeeded first Vice President Spiro T. Agnew and then President Nixon after both men were forced from office by scandal.\n''Gerald Ford brought to the political arena no demons, no hidden agenda, no hit list or acts of vengeance,'' said Mr. Brokaw, who explained that Mr. Ford had asked him to address the funeral as a representative of the press corps. ''He knew who he was, and he didn't require consultants or gurus to change him.''\nMr. Kissinger in particular emphasized the substantive achievements of Mr. Ford in foreign policy, saying the ''deserved commentary'' on Mr. Ford's character ''has sometimes obscured how sweeping and lasting were his achievements.'' In remarks perhaps intended to reflect on his own record as well as Mr. Ford's, he credited the former president with keeping ethnic conflicts in Cyprus and Lebanon from spiraling out of control, producing the first peace agreement between Israel and Egypt and presiding over ''the final agony of Indochina with dignity and wisdom.''\nHistorians, Mr. Kissinger added, will find ''that the cold war could not have been won had not Gerald Ford emerged at a tragic period to restore equilibrium to America and confidence in its international role.''\nA few hours after the service, the plane carrying Mr. Ford's body circled over the University of Michigan football stadium, where he had been a standout center and linebacker, then landed at the airport named for him in Grand Rapids. The university's marching band, which arrived on a red-eye flight from California after the Rose Bowl game on Monday, solemnly played its fight song, ''The Victors.''\nAbout 200 friends and local dignitaries invited by Mr. Ford's family attended the brief ceremony before the 13-mile motorcade to his presidential museum in downtown Grand Rapids, passing thousands of residents who lined the streets, some holding signs that said ''Welcome home.'' Billboards around the city declared ''Gerald 'Our' Ford: 1913-2006.''\nDespite a fierce, bitter wind blowing off the Grand River, Tim Micho waited with his video camera and 7-year-old daughter, Tessa, for two and a half hours to watch the motorcade pass by.\n''She'll probably never get to see something like this again,'' Mr. Micho, 43, said. ''It's so moving to see this many people out here to support him.''\nA single bagpiper played ''Amazing Grace'' as Betty Ford and the rest of the family made their way slowly behind the coffin into the museum, a geometric, glassy structure along the water. Inside, they held a brief service for family and honored guests, including former President Carter.\nLike many along the streets in Grand Rapids, Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm spoke of Mr. Ford's deep roots in the region.\nHere, Ms. Granholm said, Mr. Ford had learned from his family ''some good Midwestern values likehard work and sportsmanship and integrity and honesty.'' Here, he had played high school football (with a few men, now frail, in attendance on Tuesday), had married and had been elected to Congress.\n''Welcome home,'' Ms. Granholm said, ''to the people that you reflected so well when you were in Washington.''\nTHE 38TH PRESIDENT
1816076	Recalling Values And Strengths	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E3DD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Following are excerpts from eulogies yesterday for former President Gerald R. Ford by former President George Bush; former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger; Tom Brokaw, the former NBC News anchor; and President Bush. A full transcript: nytimes.com/washington.\nFormer President Bush\nTo political ally and adversary alike, Jerry Ford's word was always good.\nAnd, of course, when the lie that was Watergate was finally laid bare, once again we entrusted our future and our hopes to this good man. The very sight of Chief Justice Burger administering the oath of office to our 38th president instantly restored the honor of the Oval Office and helped America begin to turn the page on one of our saddest chapters.\nAs Americans we generally eschew notions of the indispensable man, and yet during those traumatic times, few if any of our public leaders could have stepped into the breach and rekindled our national faith as did President Gerald R. Ford.\nHistory has a way of matching man and moment. And just as President Lincoln's stubborn devotion to our Constitution kept the Union together during the Civil War, and just as F.D.R.'s optimism was the perfect antidote to the despair of the Great Depression, so too can we say that Jerry Ford's decency was the ideal remedy for the deception of Watergate.\nMr. Kissinger\nGerald Ford was always driven by his concern for humane values. He stumped me in his fifth day in office when he used the first call made by the Soviet ambassador to intervene on behalf of a Lithuanian seaman who four years earlier had in a horrible bungle been turned over to Soviet authorities after seeking asylum in America.\nAgainst all diplomatic precedent and, I must say, against the advice of all experts, Gerald Ford requested that the seaman, a Soviet citizen in a Soviet jail, not only be released, but be turned over to American custody. Even more amazingly, his request was granted.\nThroughout the final ordeal of Indochina, Gerald Ford focused on America's duty to rescue the maximum number of those who had relied on us. The extraction of 150,000 refugees was the consequence. And typically Gerald Ford saw it as his duty to visit one of the refugee camps long after public attention had moved elsewhere.\nGerald Ford summed up his concern for human values at the European Security Conference, when looking directly at Brezhnev he proclaimed America's deep devotion to human rights and individual freedoms. ''To my country,'' he said, ''they're not clichés or empty phrases.''\nMr. Brokaw\nWe could identify with him -- all of us -- for so many reasons. Among them, we were all trapped in what passed for style in the '70s with a wardrobe with lapels out to here, white belts, plaid jackets and trousers so patterned that they would give you a migraine.\nThe rest of us have been able to destroy most of the evidence of our fashion meltdown, but presidents are not so lucky. Those David Kennerly photographs are reminders of his endearing qualities. But some of those jackets -- I think that they're eligible for a presidential pardon or at least a digital touchup.\nPresident Bush\nLong before he was known in Washington, Gerald Ford showed his character and his leadership. As a star football player for the University of Michigan, he came face to face with racial prejudice.\nWhen Georgia Tech came to Ann Arbor for a football game, one of Michigan's best players was an African-American student named Willis Ward. Georgia Tech said they would not take the field if a black man were allowed to play.\nGerald Ford was furious at Georgia Tech for making the demand and at the University of Michigan for caving in. He agreed to play only after Willis Ward personally asked him to. The stand Gerald Ford took that day was never forgotten by his friend.\nAnd Gerald Ford never forgot that day, either. And three decades later, he proudly supported the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act in the United States Congress. And so when President Nixon needed to replace a vice president who had resigned in scandal, he naturally turned to a man whose name was a synonym for integrity, Gerald R. Ford.\nAnd eight months later, when he was elevated to the presidency, it was because America needed him, not because he needed the office.\nTHE 38TH PRESIDENT
1816077	Parolee With Violent Past Is Charged in 2 L.I. Killings	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E2DD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	A parolee who has served more than 30 years in prison for two separate homicides and other violent crimes in New York City was arrested yesterday by the Suffolk County police and charged in the shooting deaths of a 52-year-old woman and her 30-year-old son over the weekend.\nThe man, Fernando DeCampoamor, 59, of Mount Sinai, N.Y., was scheduled to be arraigned today on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of the woman, Amelia Garcia, and her son, Ferneliz Cruz, the authorities said. They were found shot once in the head in the basement apartment in Coram where they lived with Mr. Cruz's wife and their two small children.\nAccording to the police, the suspect told investigators he had lent money to Ms. Garcia, whom he described as his companion of six months, and became enraged Saturday evening over what he said was a delay in repayment.\nMr. Cruz and his family had spent that early evening at a nearby self-service laundry. He had returned home first with a few loads of clean clothes. His wife, Yessenia Hernandez, and their children, an 8-year-old and a 2-month-old, returned to the apartment 20 minutes later to find Ms. Garcia dead and Mr. Cruz severely wounded. He died on Sunday night, about 24 hours later, at Stony Brook University Medical Center.\nIt was unclear whether Mr. Cruz had returned to the apartment, on Marie Lane, before his mother was shot or after, the police said.\nDetective Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick of the Suffolk police said that according to state records, Mr. DeCampoamor was convicted of a murder in Brooklyn in 1961 and paroled in 1967. In 1968, he was convicted in connection with a nonfatal shooting and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was paroled in 1975. In 1985, he was sentenced to 81/3 to 25 years in prison for manslaughter in connection with a killing in Queens. He was paroled in 2003 and had been working recently as a tow truck driver.\nLieutenant Fitzpatrick said he did not know whether Ms. Garcia had any knowledge of Mr. DeCampoamor's criminal background.\nNeighbors and friends said Ms. Garcia and Mr. Cruz immigrated from the Dominican Republic about 12 years ago. Ms. Garcia helped care for her son's children while he and his wife worked. Neighbors said he worked full time for a bakery and bread distributing company, and might have held other part-time jobs, including one as a waiter. His wife worked part time at a local fast-food restaurant.\nA neighbor, Darlene Kennedy, 32, described the family as close-knit and unfailingly polite. She said the 8-year-old, Yerneli, who played with her children, was cheerful and very bright and seemed to love learning new games.\nFrom the open door of the family's basement apartment, which was covered in black dust left by police fingerprint technicians on Monday, a chess board and chess pieces could be seen on the kitchen table. Blood was pooled on the linoleum.
1816078	Bag Handlers Held in Theft Of Luggage In Houston	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E1DD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Wondering what happened to your lost airline luggage?\nIf you flew through Houston over Christmas, check with the police. They may have it.\nOfficials on Tuesday announced the arrest of five men charged with stealing the bags, including 23-year-old twins. All worked for a contractor at George Bush Intercontinental Airport handling luggage between connecting flights within a secure area of the airport. Officials provided few details, saying the investigation was continuing.\nThe arrests followed the discovery of 68 pieces of looted luggage on Dec. 26 in a trash bin outside a pet store in north Houston. Since then, said Capt. Rick Bownds, commander of the Houston Police Department's airport division, more than 90 additional pieces have turned up in two other places.\n''We're still uncovering leads and information as we speak,'' he said, adding that virtually every airline at the airport was probably affected by the thefts.\nThe five men, all charged with one felony count of engaging in an organized criminal activity, worked for Menzies Aviation, which operates in 23 countries and 100 airports, including 15 in the United States, providing passenger, ramp and cargo services. All had credentials to work in secure areas of the airport, and all the luggage taken was being transferred between connecting flights, Captain Bownds said.\nJohn Fulford, a Menzies vice president, said that theft was a continuing issue across the industry and that the company had a ''zero tolerance'' policy and planned to ''take robust action.'' He said he was not aware of any similar thefts by company employees in the United States.\nRichard Vacar, director of the Houston airport system, said that to receive an airport identification badge a person's identity and fingerprints are submitted to a clearinghouse and the federal government conducts background checks. He declined to provide details but said that there was a list of disqualifying felonies and that the record check goes back 10 years.\nMark Mancuso, deputy director of safety for the airport system, said once the criminal investigation was complete, the airport system would conduct its own investigation into employment practices. For now, the police said they were working with the airlines to track down the owners of the luggage. One of the problems, since these were bags in transit, is that travelers would not realize the luggage was missing until arriving at their final destination.\nNor do the police yet have a good idea of what was stolen.\n''It's a matter of locating the owners of the bag to find out what items were reported missing,'' Captain Bownds said.
1816079	Indonesian Officials Now Say They Don't Know Fate of Missing Jet	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E1DD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Indonesian officials reversed themselves on Tuesday and admitted that they did not know what had happened to a passenger jet that disappeared from radar screens in bad weather on Monday shortly after issuing a distress signal.\nOn Monday, Indonesian Air Force and Transport Ministry officials told local and foreign news services that wreckage from a 17-year-old Boeing 737-400 operated by Adam Air had been found strewn on jungle-covered mountainside on Sulawesi island. They also said 12 of the 102 people on board had survived.\nBut later they said reports that the wreckage and survivors had been found were wrong. Officials said they had been misled by incorrect information from villagers and local officials in the remote area where the reports had originated.\n''We apologize for the news that we released earlier,'' said Eddy Suyanto, an air force official, The Associated Press reported. ''It was not true.''\nIndonesian officials said they planned to resume the search for the plane on Wednesday.\nThe presumed crash was another loss for the Indonesian aviation industry, which boomed after deregulation in 1999 led to the founding of several low-cost airlines but which has had a long history of accidents.\nIt was a particularly bitter blow to Adam Adhitya Suherman, 26, the president of Adam SkyConnection Airlines. In an Indonesian industry known for bankruptcies and safety problems, Mr. Suherman and his family of Chinese traders had aimed to create a reliable and relatively inexpensive airline for a rapidly growing pool of Indonesian travelers. And they seemed to be succeeding.\nFrom a shoestring domestic operation, started in 2003 with three leased Boeing 737s, the airline grew by 2006 into a $300 million-a-year business, flying 19 planes to 25 domestic and international destinations and harboring big ambitions for growth. The family's goal for 2006 was to carry six million to eight million passengers. It was courted by big investors, including Qantas and Tiger Airways.\nWhile emphasizing safety, the airline has had its share of troubles. On Feb. 11 last year, an Adam Air flight to Makassar from Jakarta lost its way, making an unscheduled landing hundreds of miles off course in eastern Indonesia. The pilots blamed a malfunction in the navigation equipment but Mr. Suherman said it had been working properly.\nOn May 31, 2005, part of the landing gear of a Boeing 737 operated by Adam Air collapsed on landing at the Jakarta airport.\nMore Rescued After Ferry Sinking\nREMBANG, Indonesia, Jan. 2 (AP) -- Fishing boats rescued dozens of people from the sea on Tuesday, four days after a ferry sank in a storm off Indonesia, but 400 people remained missing.\nThe ferry Senopati Nusantara foundered after being pounded by heavy waves for more than 10 hours as it neared the end of a two-day journey to Java, Indonesia's main island, from the Indonesian section of Borneo island. Officials said the bad weather caused the sinking.\nAbout 200 survivors have been found, and officials say the search will continue until Sunday. Thirteen bodies have been recovered and scores more have been seen floating at sea.\nSusilo, 35, was picked up by fishermen and taken to a hospital with chest pains and respiratory problems after drifting four days in a life raft.\n''Six among us died, one by one,'' said Mr. Susilo, who like many Indonesians uses one name. Some who died drank seawater, he said.
1816080	Israeli Admits Big Errors in Lebanon War, but Won't Resign	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E1DD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Israeli chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, conceded Tuesday that the military had made serious errors during last summer's war against Hezbollah in Lebanon but said he would not resign his post.\nGeneral Halutz said Israel had badly damaged Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and killed ''hundreds of terrorists.'' But he said Israel was ''not successful in reducing the short-range rocket fire on Israel's north until the cease-fire,'' which came after 34 days of fighting.\nCritics of General Halutz and of the Israeli government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have said the military relied too heavily on air power and delayed too long sending in ground troops in the numbers needed to push back the Hezbollah fighters and supporters who were firing Katyusha rockets into Israel.\nCritics have also said that the military should be led by a ground forces commander -- General Halutz spent his career in the air force -- and that reserves were not called up in time, were badly trained and equipped, and often faced contradictory orders.\n''We attacked the Katyushas, but unsuccessfully,'' General Halutz said.\nHe spoke Tuesday at a Tel Aviv news conference summing up the army's own investigation of its behavior during the war.\nHe said he would stay on ''to correct what can be corrected,'' and said to resign now would be ''running away.'' He said Mr. Olmert and Defense Minister Amir Peretz had not asked him to go. ''I have not heard my superiors calling on me to resign,'' he said. ''If they do, I will respond.''\nHe suggested that discipline had broken down to some degree. ''There were cases in which officers did not carry out their assignments, and cases in which officers objected on moral grounds to their orders,'' he said, an apparent reference to resistance against attacking southern Lebanese towns and villages.\nHe said that those instances of refusal ''ran counter to the army's basic values'' and that a senior officer was suspended as a result.\nDuring the war, as criticism mounted, General Halutz effectively demoted the commander of the northern front, Maj. Gen. Udi Adam, putting the deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Moshe Kaplinski, alongside him. General Adam later quit the army.\nPreviously, General Halutz has said the army fired some cluster munitions, with the ''bomblets'' placed in artillery shells, into southern Lebanon in contradiction of his orders that they be aimed only at specific targets.\nThe United States is investigating whether the Israelis used cluster munitions made and paid for in America in ways that contravene American regulations for the weapons' use.\nGeneral Halutz implicitly criticized Mr. Olmert for setting as a goal of the war the release of two Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah in a cross-border raid on July 12, an act that set off the fighting.\nThe Winograd committee, which is led by a retired judge, Eliyahu Winograd, and was appointed by the government, is still investigating the conflict and its outcome.\nGeneral Halutz said that if the committee called for his resignation, ''of course'' he would comply. Defense Minister Amir Peretz has made the same pledge.\nThe war ended with a cease-fire on Aug. 14, after a United Nations Security Council resolution mandated an enlarged and strengthened international peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon and supervision of Lebanon's seacoast and border with Syria to prevent the rearming of Hezbollah.\nThe fighting left more than 1,000 people dead on both sides. Israel says more than 500 of the dead were Hezbollah fighters, but Hezbollah disputes that.\nIsrael counted 159 fatalities, including 39 civilians who were killed by the more than 4,000 rockets Hezbollah fired into Israel.\nIn Gaza on Tuesday, Palestinian security forces were searching for a Peruvian photographer for Agence France-Presse, Jaime Razuri, 50, a day after his abduction.\nThe Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, said he was hopeful. ''We're sure he will soon be released,'' Mr. Abbas told a delegation from the news agency and French and Peruvian diplomats. ''In past incidents of this kind, hostages have been freed after one or two days.''\nIn the latest in a string of foreigner abductions, several unmasked gunmen abducted Mr. Razuri in the center of Gaza City on Monday as he was returning from an assignment with an interpreter and a driver.\nSeparately, warring Hamas and Fatah factions returned 14 fighters kidnapped on Monday after mediation from representatives of Islamic Jihad, Palestinian officials said.\nThe violence resumed Monday when Hamas gunmen shot at a brother of a senior Fatah militant in the northern Gaza Strip, violating an earlier deal for a general truce.
1816081	Ethiopian Premier Says His Troops Won't Stay in Somalia	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E1DD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia said Tuesday that his country, one of the poorest in the world, could not afford to keep troops in Somalia much longer and that it was ill equipped to play the role of peacekeeper there.\nTwo hours after he spoke, two Ethiopian soldiers were gunned down in an ambush in southern Somalia in one of the first strikes of an anticipated anti-Ethiopian guerrilla campaign.\nAccording to residents in Jilib, about 250 miles southwest of Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, a fighter for the Islamist forces, who were routed last week by Ethiopian-led troops, had shot two Ethiopian soldiers while they were crossing a bridge. Witnesses said the fighter then dashed into town and was quickly surrounded by Ethiopian troops, who killed him.\n''It was a suicide mission,'' said Mohammed Subiye, a farmer in Jilib.\nThe Islamist forces, which in the span of one week went from ruling much of Somalia to fleeing into the bush, have vowed to fight a guerrilla insurgency against the Ethiopians, whom they consider infidel invaders.\nBut Mr. Meles said he did not plan to have his troops to remain in Somalia for much longer, possibly only a few more weeks. The troops were dispatched to neutralize the rising regional threat posed by the Islamists, he said, and now international peacekeepers are needed to bring order to a country that has been synonymous with anarchy for 15 years.\n''We don't have the money to take this burden individually,'' Mr. Meles said during a speech to Ethiopia's Parliament.\nDiplomats in the region are hurrying to cobble together an African peacekeeping solution, but despite murmurs of commitment from several countries, including Uganda, South Africa and Nigeria, a force has yet to materialize.\nSomalia is far from stable, with many heavy weapons still in the hands of warlords, and the country's turmoil is likely to dissuade many nations from volunteering troops.\nOn Tuesday, Ali Mohammed Gedi, Somalia's transitional prime minister, reiterated his plea for the nation's many gunmen to turn in their weapons. But few seemed to be listening. The collection points across Mogadishu remained empty, and many young men defiantly vowed to keep their guns.\nMeanwhile, the remnants of the once-fierce Islamist army continued to flee south from Kismayo, the port city 100 miles from the Kenyan border that had been a final stronghold until the Islamist military definitively collapsed there on Monday.\nKenyan authorities said 10 fighters were apprehended on Monday as they tried to slip through the border disguised as refugees. Eight had Eritrean passports while two had Canadian passports, said Alfred Mutua, a spokesman for the Kenyan government. All of them were carrying briefcases packed with cash.\n''They definitely didn't look like refugees,'' Mr. Mutua said.\nMr. Mutua said that the suspects remained in Kenyan custody and that they would probably be returned to Somalia to face charges under the transitional government, though it has not yet set up a justice system.\nThe Islamists tried to improve their military prospects by calling for a global jihad against Ethiopia, a country with a long Christian history. But in the end, American officials said, only a few hundred foreign fighters answered the call, the bulk of them from Eritrea, Ethiopia's archenemy.\nStill, the Islamists were widely believed to have been sheltering several wanted terrorists, and American officials said they were hoping to use the swift collapse of the Islamist forces as an opportunity to capture men they have been chasing for years.\nShips from the Fifth Fleet of the United States Navy, based in Bahrain, have increased patrols off Somalia's coast to prevent any suspects from escaping.\n''Yes, we have a presence out there,'' said Lt. Denise Garcia, a spokeswoman for the Fifth Fleet.\nSo far, though, no suspects have been apprehended.\nSomalia continues to be a work in progress. The country's transitional president, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, has yet to set foot in the capital, and only a select few officials of the transitional government have returned to it. Many of them seem to be pulling in wildly different directions.\nOn Tuesday, Hussein Mohammed Aideed, the interior minister and son of a notorious warlord, announced that he would like to erase the 1,000-mile long border between Somalia and Ethiopia.\n''We should unite, just like the Europeans,'' Mr. Aideed said at a news conference. ''One money. One passport. One security.''\nMany Somalis consider Ethiopia a historic enemy and were appalled by the suggestion.\n''All I can say is that the interior minister is entitled to his opinion,'' said Abdirahman Dinari, the spokesman for the transitional government. ''But he does not speak on behalf of the government.''
1816083	When She Speaks, He's Breaking All of Islam's Taboos	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0DD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Ali Saleem may have devised the perfect, if improbable, cover for breaking taboos in conservative, Muslim Pakistan.\nIn a country where publicly talking about sex is strictly off limits, Mr. Saleem has managed not only to bring up the subject on his prime-time television talk show -- but to do so without stirring a backlash from fundamentalist Islamic clerics.\nAnd he has done so as a woman.\nWhen Mr. Saleem takes to the airwaves, he is Begum Nawazish Ali, a coquettish widow who interviews Pakistan's glitterati and some of its top politicians.\nA real woman could not possibly do what Mr. Saleem does. In the unlikely event a station would broadcast such a show, the hostess would be shunned. And taking on the guise of a married woman -- whose virtue is crucial to her whole family -- would be equally impossible.\nBut apparently a cross-dressing man pretending to be a widow is another matter entirely.\nIt is something of a mystery why a man who openly acknowledges he is bisexual is a sensation here. Traditional Islamic teaching rejects bisexuals and gays, and gay Pakistanis have few outlets for a social life. The gay party scenes in Lahore and Karachi are deep underground.\nMr. Saleem has his own theory for his popularity: he thinks Pakistan has always been more open than outsiders believed.\nIt is true that Pakistan is, in a sense, two countries. There is urban, and urbane, Pakistan, where Western mores are more accepted, although nudity would never be seen on television or scantily clad women on billboards. And then there is rural Pakistan, where Islam is generally practiced with more fervor.\nIt is also true that the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, is relatively tolerant about what the media can show and cover, including politics. Although General Musharraf came to power in a bloodless coup by the military in 1999, he has been more open to political criticism in the press than some of his democratic predecessors.\nMr. Saleem, 28, is thrilled with his success for reasons that are both political (he is proud to be breaking ground in bringing up tough subjects) and profoundly personal. ''My biggest high is to see myself gorgeous in the mirror'' he said recently while reclining in a makeup-room chair. As a beautician outlined his eyes, adding glitter and eye shadow, he said, ''Maybe, yes, I am a diva.''\nIt is hard to judge how successful Mr. Saleem's show is -- there is no form of Nielsen ratings here. And there are clearly people who find the show revolting.\nBut by many measures, it is a success. Television critics have been generally supportive, and the show, which has been on a year and a half, has a prime-time slot despite its name, ''Late Night Show With Begum Nawazish Ali.'' Mr. Saleem said it was named for its racy content, usually shown late, but he said the network scheduled it earlier hoping for a hit that would bring in more advertising revenue.\nUrbanites, meanwhile, seem not to be able to get enough of the once-a-week show, which is rerun twice each week. They have showered praise on Mr. Saleem's portrayal of a middle-aged widow who, in glamorous saris and glittery diamonds, invites to her drawing room politicians, movie stars and rights advocates from Pakistan and India.\nWith fluttering eyelids and glossy lips, Begum Nawazish Ali (Begum means Lady or Mrs. in Urdu) flirts with male guests using suggestive banter and sexual innuendo. With female guests, she is something of a tease, challenging them about who looks better. Questions are pointed and piercing. Politics, democracy and saucy gossip are enmeshed in her conversation.\nMr. Saleem sees the show's acceptance and commercial success as a testimony to the tolerance and moderation of Pakistan, a country often seen by the outside world as teetering on the edges of militancy and extremism.\nColorful and witty, Mr. Saleem is open about his own sexuality and sprinkles his conversation with gender-bending phrases. ''My life fluctuates between two extremes,'' he says. ''I always say this: I am a man and I am a woman. It is two gender extremes, and I am constantly trying to balance it.''\nHe is unabashed at the criticism that his show often borders on raunchiness. ''Sitting senators have sent requests to be on the show,'' he says.\nMr. Saleem has also been willing to take on tough political subjects. He is openly critical of the army's role in ruling Pakistan, for instance.\nHis show is not the only one pushing the envelope on that and other touchy subjects.\nIn another network television program, ''Aalim Online,'' religious scholars from Shiite and Sunni sects sat side by side and responded to viewers' queries on different issues from their respective viewpoints.\nTelevision talk shows and news programs have also openly criticized the policies of previous governments on their support for the Taliban and on their policies in Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim.\nPresident Musharraf's policies and the role of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, have come under fire on talk shows and analysis programs, something unimaginable some years ago.\nThat is not to say that anything goes. The restrictions on print media are generally tougher than for broadcast journalists, and some subjects are considered clearly off limits.\nOwais Aslam Ali, secretary general of Pakistan Press Foundation, an independent media research center in Karachi, said that ''on things of consequence, restrictions remain.'' He said that included reporting on the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban and Al Qaeda are taking refuge.\nMr. Ali said there also were unstated restrictions on reporting about Baluchistan, the southwestern province where a low-level civil insurgency has long simmered. ''This is a big black hole as far as media is concerned,'' he said. ''Parameters have been set. You cross those parameters at your own peril.''\nMr. Saleem, who in the guise of Begum Nawazish Ali often gets away with questions to politicians that print journalists might be wary of, said his show would not have been a possibility earlier. ''I owe Begum Nawazish Ali's existence, in a certain way, to General Musharraf,'' he said.\nBut he appears to know his own limits. He shrugged when asked if he should not invite the general himself on the show, appearing to indicate that he knew that was one taboo he could not break. But it did not stop him from flirting with the idea, especially after General Musharraf made himself so open to the media during his book tour of the United States last year.\n''I would love it if Musharraf would come on the show,'' he said. ''If he can go on Jon Stewart's show, then why not?''\nKARACHI JOURNAL
1816084	Democrats Plan First 100 Hours, Give or Take a Speech	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E0DD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	House Democrats intend to kick off their new regime with a 100-hour legislative blitz that would allow them to post a series of quick victories before President Bush even delivers his State of the Union address toward the end of this month.\nBut don't pull out that stopwatch to begin the countdown just yet.\nEven as Democrats filtered back to Capitol Hill on Tuesday in anticipation of the opening of the 110th Congress on Thursday, there was a bit of confusion about just when the 100 hours would officially begin. Would it be as soon as the new Congress was sworn in and began voting on internal rules changes? Or when the House takes up its first actual legislation next Tuesday?\nAnd since it is 100 hours of strictly legislative activity, the clock would be on pause when House members give their customary one-minute speeches at the start of each day and during the ''special orders'' at night when members reserve floor time to carry on about their favorite issues for the C-Span audience.\nAnd next Monday is out since the House, despite Democratic pledges of a disciplined five-day work schedule, will not be in session. The day off was scheduled to allow freshman lawmakers time to return from an orientation session -- and others to attend the college football national championship game.\nAt the same time, House Republicans, forced to the Congressional sidelines for the first time in 12 years, were growing increasingly agitated about the Democratic timetable. They said that the rush by Democrats to force through legislation on national security, the minimum wage, student loan costs and energy without a full slate of hearings -- and with limits on the ability of Republicans to offer alternatives -- undercut the pledges of Democrats to run things in a more transparent, collegial way than the Republicans had when they were in power.\nDemocrats eventually decided Tuesday that the 100-hour timer would be started next Tuesday, when the House is scheduled to take up H.R. 1, a measure enacting recommendations from the bipartisan Sept. 11 commission that never made it out of the Republican-controlled Congress.\nAnd they brushed aside complaints from the Republicans, saying Democrats campaigned specifically on this initial flurry of legislation, much of which has been considered, run through committee and ultimately rejected by Republicans in the past.\n''These are deliverable,'' Brendan Daly, a spokesman for the incoming House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said of the 100-hour topics. ''These are things we said we would do if we are in charge and would make a direct impact on Americans' lives.''\nUnder the current Democratic schedule, the Sept. 11 measure would be followed by a vote on increasing the federal minimum wage to $7.25 over two years. Next would come legislation expanding embryonic stem cell research that was vetoed last year by Mr. Bush. Democrats would then move to eliminate a prohibition on federal officials' negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for lower prices for those enrolled in the Medicare drug program.\nAfter that, Democrats are planning to take up a proposal to cut the interest rate on federally subsidized student loans to 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent. Lastly, Democrats hope to wind up on Jan. 18 with legislation that seeks to make sure that oil companies pay adequate royalties on disputed leases, rolls back some industry subsidies from a recent energy bill and creates a renewable energy reserve to try to spur investment in new technologies and conservation.\nBefore getting to those bills, House Democrats said they would move immediately upon taking control Thursday to pass broad ethics rules including a ban on gifts and meals from lobbyists and restrictions on travel provided by outside groups. On Friday, they will vote on disclosure of earmarks and new budget rules to prohibit deficit spending.\nThe leadership plans to allow some of the party's freshmen to sponsor changes so they can begin building a record and reputation to defend their seats in 2008.\nThe pace of activity is to be much slower in the Senate, and passage of any of the legislation by the House does not guarantee that it will be sent to the White House, given the Senate's thin 51-49 Democratic majority.\nLeading Senate Republicans have indicated that they could support the minimum wage increase, for instance, only if it is tied to tax relief for small businesses. As a result, that measure is likely to either stall or be changed, leading to negotiations with the House.\nThe Senate plans to convene Thursday and swear in its new members. But both parties plan to hold retreats on Friday, and aides said the only legislation that could come up for a vote this week would be a resolution honoring former President Gerald R. Ford.\nHouse Republicans, who were not known for giving Democrats much say on legislation when they ran the House, began an orchestrated campaign on Tuesday to pressure Democrats to allow full committee review of the 100-hour legislation.\n''As we both know, homeland security is far too important an issue to play politics with, and any new homeland security measure should be given the review and oversight it deserves,'' Representative Peter T. King of New York, the top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, wrote to Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the incoming Democratic chairman.\nDemocrats said the legislation at issue had already been vetted and in many cases voted on in the past. They said Republicans would be given their chance once the 100 hours had elapsed. ''After that, we will go back through regular order,'' said Mr. Daly, Ms. Pelosi's spokesman.
1816085	An American University For Iraq but Not in Baghdad	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03EFDD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	It would be an ambitious project even in a Middle Eastern country not embroiled in war: build an American-style university where classes are taught in English, teachers come from around the world and graduates compete for lucrative jobs in fields like business and computer science.\nYet some of the leading lights of Iraq's political and intellectual classes are doing exactly that, even as the bloodshed widens.\nTheir planned American University of Iraq is modeled after the famous private universities in Cairo and Beirut. The project's managers have a board of trustees; a business plan recently completed by McKinsey & Company, an international consulting firm; three candidates for university president; and $25 million, much of it in pledges from the American government and Kurdish sources. To fulfill their dream, they need much more: $200 million to $250 million over 15 years, said Azzam Alwash, the board's executive secretary.\nBut if it does become a reality, the university will not be built in Baghdad, which for centuries was a beacon of learning in the Arab world.\nInstead, it is slated for what is the most non-Iraqi part of Iraq. The site is on a windswept hilltop along the outskirts of Sulaimaniya, the eastern capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, 150 miles north of Baghdad and far from the car bombs and death squads that are tearing apart the Arab regions of Iraq. Because of its relative safety so far, Kurdistan can more easily attract aid and reconstruction money.\nWith doctors, engineers, businesspeople, academics and students among the hundreds of thousands fleeing to neighboring countries or the West, the university raises hopes of stanching the country's enormous brain drain and pushing Iraq forward. ''You really need to develop the political elite of the future, the educated elite of the future,'' said Barham Salih, the project's Kurdish founder, a deputy prime minister who received a doctorate in statistics and computer modeling from Liverpool University in Britain, and whose daughter attends Princeton. ''The focus is also to stimulate reform in the Iraqi education system.''\nHowever, some Arab education officials in Baghdad, the capital, have argued that the university should be built there, not in a part of Iraq where secessionist ambitions are well known.\nBaghdad first achieved fame for its schools and scholars during the Abbasid caliphate, which reached its height in the eighth century. Even in the 20th century, before the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and international economic sanctions of the 1990s, students from the region flocked to Baghdad.\nBut because of security threats, many universities in Baghdad have been closed since October. Up to 150 employees from the Ministry of Higher Education were abducted by men in commando uniforms in mid-November. Jihadist groups have threatened to kill students on campuses.\nSo intellectuals like Kanan Makiya, the prominent former exile and writer who strongly advocated for the American invasion, say they plan to move their research projects to the American University. Mr. Makiya founded the Iraq Memory Foundation, an organization based in the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad that is documenting Saddam Hussein's atrocities.\n''The problem is nobody can thrive in Baghdad anymore,'' said Mr. Makiya, who teaches Middle Eastern studies at Brandeis University and sits on the new university's board of trustees. ''The north is much more stable, growing, prosperous.''\n''There is a sadness that we're being driven out of Baghdad,'' he added.\nThe university's planners plan to make Mr. Makiya's documentary project the core of the humanities department. Mr. Alwash, an environmental scientist, has said he will use the university as a base for his research project, which is about rejuvenating the southern marshlands.\nOther prominent intellectual and political figures, many of whom supported the American invasion, are on the board. They include Fouad Ajami, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins, and John Agresto, an education adviser in the Coalition Provisional Authority who, as he ended his tenure there in 2004, told a reporter he was ''a neoconservative who's been mugged by reality.''\nThe planners have sketched a rough schedule. Construction would start in the spring, and the first 15 to 30 students could begin a six-month intensive English course, to be taught in rented space here in Sulaimaniya, before they start a two-year master's program in business administration. The first class to earn bachelor's degrees would start in fall 2008; the program would take five years, with the first devoted to the study of English, Mr. Alwash said.\nAlthough the university has regional aspirations like its counterparts in Cairo and Beirut, the first undergraduate class would be mostly Iraqis, Mr. Alwash said, and a majority probably Kurds.\nIn the university's first five years, degree programs would focus on subjects that the board judges to be crucial to Iraq's development: business, petroleum engineering and computer science, for example. ''This has to have immediate practical consequences for the economy of Iraq and the politics of Iraq,'' Mr. Salih, the founder, said.\nAfter five years, the university may add humanities degree programs.\n''We want them to study the ideas of Locke, the ideas and writings of Paine and Madison,'' Mr. Alwash, the executive secretary, said. ''We want them to understand what democracy is -- not only majority rule, but also the rights of minorities. They should be well rounded.''\nProjected undergraduate enrollment is 1,000 students by 2011 and 5,000 by 2021. The numbers are small compared with enrollment at Baghdad University, the country's flagship public university, which has 70,000 students. Sulaimaniya University here has about 12,000 students.\nIn total, about 475,000 Iraqis are pursuing college-level degrees across the country, in 21 public universities or colleges, 18 private ones and about 40 technical institutes, according to the American Embassy.\nTuition at American University would be $8,500 to $10,000 a year, Mr. Alwash said. That places the university beyond the reach of the average middle-class Iraqi family. But Mr. Salih said the school planned to give loans and scholarships.\nZalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador and an alumnus of the university in Beirut, has promised that American agencies will give the school $10.5 million, possibly the largest donation by the United States to any single education project in Iraq, if American officials approve the business plan. Mr. Khalilzad, a native Afghan, helped found the American University of Kabul after the American military ousted the Taliban from Afghanistan in 2001.\nSome Kurds fear that the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the governing party of eastern Kurdistan led by Mr. Talabani and Mr. Salih, could end up diverting money from the university for its own purposes. Among many Kurds, the main Kurdish parties have a reputation for corruption and authoritarian rule.\n''I hope this will not just be party propaganda, because we need a real academic center for this society,'' said Asos Hardi, the editor in chief of a weekly newspaper here. ''Having a Western-style university in Iraq would help strengthen education here and across the country.''\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ
1816087	Peterson Considers Jump From Oklahoma to N.F.L.	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401EEDD1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Lost in the aftermath of Oklahoma's wild overtime loss to Boise State in the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night was what might have been the final college game of the star tailback Adrian Peterson.\nPeterson, a junior, returned to action for the first time since breaking his collarbone on Oct. 14 and delivered an unimpressive performance, with 77 yards on 20 carries.\nHe did score two touchdowns, including a 25-yard scoring burst around the left side on Oklahoma's first play of overtime. But he failed to live up to the lofty standards he set for himself in his three seasons at Oklahoma. At the end, like many who watched and played in the game, Peterson was left nearly speechless.\n''My head is just spinning,'' he said. He added later: ''I feel terrible. We lost.''\nPeterson was expected to declare after the game that he would go to the National Football League. When his closest friend on the team, Marcus Walker, was asked about Peterson's future, he said that he, too, expected an announcement. ''I'm pretty sure he'll answer that question tonight,'' Walker said.\nBut Peterson declined to state his intentions, saying he had until Jan. 16 to declare for the draft.\n''I just want to take my time to think things over thoroughly,'' he said. ''I'm going to take my time.''\nPeterson may be considered the top running back available in the draft. He had 4,045 rushing yards in his three seasons at Oklahoma.\nThose statistics are more impressive when considering that he missed seven games this season because of his collarbone injury and parts of last season with an ankle injury.\n''I think he's one of the best players to ever suit up in college football,'' Walker said. ''And when he's ready, he'll go and become one of the best running backs to ever play the game.''\nFOOTBALL

In study after study, researchers around the world are consistently arriving at the same answer: education. Going to school just a few extra years can improve health in old age and extend life by years.

1816089	Data on Hispanic Immigrants Presents Puzzle on Aging	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E7DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	If medical researchers were to pick someone who might defy national life expectancy statistics, few would pick Irma Lara.\nShe came to this country illegally from a small town in Mexico to work as a baby sitter. She was 26, had only a first-grade education and was desperately poor.\nShe married a Mexican-American and had seven children. Her husband's meager salary at a cotton compress company was never enough. The family had no health insurance, never saw a dentist. Now, widowed at 75, Mrs. Lara is still poor; her monthly income is less than $600. She spends her days at a community center near her tidy subsidized apartment in Hitchcock, Tex., playing bingo, learning English, working out with exercise bands and with weights.\n''I am happy,'' Mrs. Lara said.\nAnd, if statistics are any guide, Mrs. Lara has a long life ahead of her, longer than would be expected if she were black or a native-born white woman. It is called the Hispanic paradox, and it is one of the most puzzling discoveries in research on aging.\nFor example, a recent analysis by Irma T. Elo, a demographer at the University of Pennsylvania, indicates that a 65-year-old white woman will live, on average, an additional 18.9 years. But a 65-year-old Hispanic woman who immigrated to the United States will live an additional 19.8 years, a significant difference.\nThe longevity difference persists even though Hispanic immigrants tend to be like Mrs. Lara, poor and poorly educated and lacking health care. It persists even though, like Mrs. Lara, they get chronic diseases like arthritis and high blood pressure and are often overweight.\n''Everyone,'' said Kyriakos S. Markides, who directs the Division of Sociomedical Sciences at the University of Texas in Galveston, ''is trying to figure out what the hell is going on.''\nTwo popular hypotheses have not held up in recent studies. One said that immigrants returned home to die, leaving healthier people in the United States. The other said that healthier people were more likely to immigrate.\nSo the mystery remains.\nIn the meantime, most Hispanic immigrants are unaware that their long lives present such a puzzle.\nBut some, like Salomon Leos, a tailor who lives in Houston, have their own ideas about what makes for a long and healthy life.\nLike Mrs. Lara, Mr. Leos had almost no education. He left school after the fourth grade and came to Texas from Mexico when he was 21, arriving with his wife and children, unable to speak English and afraid of what life would hold for him.\nBut, Mr. Leos said, ''It was a time of need, and sometimes need makes you brave.''\nNow at 78, he has his own custom tailor shop. It is just a few minutes from the modest brick-faced house where Mr. Leos and his wife raised their five children, and where their children and their nine grandchildren still come to celebrate birthdays and holidays.\n''I believe that when you don't feel happy in your heart or yourself that's what shortens the life of people,'' Mr. Leos said.\n''I am not rich, but I have a full life for myself and my family,'' he added. ''That makes me feel happy.''

1816091	Daylight in Boeing's Shadow	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	When Bob Baker at Harvest Partners, a real estate development company, tells people he is putting up a shopping center across the street from Boeing's commercial jet factory, he usually gets quizzical looks. Although Renton, Wash., is a town better known for airplanes than Armani, Mr. Baker is convinced his mall will do well.\nHarvest Partners and Transwestern Investment bought the land for $37.8 million from Boeing two years ago and saw the site as ideal for new business. The 46-acre property was close to nearby highways and was centrally situated. Mr. Baker said that he realized that his center would not initially attract stores like Neiman Marcus, Crate & Barrel or Nordstrom, but that his mall would evolve with the city.\n''The moment you say Renton, people think blue collar,'' said Mr. Baker, a partner at Harvest Partners in Dallas. ''We're still fighting that perception every day.''\nRenton, 12 miles southeast of Seattle, was founded over a century ago and was initially known for coal mining, logging and brick making until rail cars were produced in the 1920s. Since the 1940s, when Boeing built a factory there, Renton's fortunes have been tied to the airplane industry.\nBut now the town of 56,840 has quietly been reducing its dependence on the cyclical aerospace industry and courting developers, companies and sports teams to move to town. Renton seems to be positioned well: developable land, speedy permitting, no local business or occupation tax and a location on the south end of Lake Washington.\n''All the pieces are finally coming together,'' said Kathy Keolker, Renton's mayor.\nResidential developers are putting up million-dollar homes and luxury apartments. The Seattle Seahawks and the Federal Reserve's Seattle branch have either announced projects or have broken ground in Renton during the last two years. The Seattle SuperSonics basketball team is even considering a move.\n''A whole lot of work has paid off,'' said Alex Pietsch, administrator of Renton's economic development, neighborhoods and strategic planning. ''We've been working nearly 10 years to promote reasons to do business, play and live here. I think that message is starting to come through.''\nEmployment in Renton, now home to Boeing's commercial jetliner division, has risen and fallen along with military spending and airline orders over the years. In 1990, jobs at Boeing accounted for 59 percent of Renton's jobs, but have since declined to 29 percent.\nWhen Boeing started moving workers out of Renton in the early 1990s and office vacancies hit 40 percent, the city sought to escape the booms and busts of the aerospace industry. It set about streamlining its permitting process, and putting together a marketing campaign with the local chamber of commerce, technical college, medical center and school district to bring new companies to town.\nIt was a well-timed move. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, airplane orders plunged and Boeing laid off more than 27,000 people in the Puget Sound area. At its Renton operation, the company stopped producing the single-aisle 757 jet, focused exclusively on its popular 737 plane and consolidated employees and assembly lines. The move freed space on its 324-acre campus, allowing it to shed 46 acres. Harvest Partners eventually bought the parcel two years ago and is in negotiations to buy about 20 more acres.\n''Years ago, everything was Boeing,'' said Wilma Warshak, a senior vice president at Colliers International in Tacoma. ''Today, there's so much more diversification, and we're not as dependent as we were.''\nThe changes in Renton extend far beyond Boeing and the shores of Lake Washington. Eleven years ago, the city moved automobile dealerships out of downtown to a site near Interstate 405 so it could redevelop the city center. Since then, a park, a regional transit center, a performing arts center, a seven-story parking garage and hundreds of apartments and condominiums have been built. Construction has begun or is planned for 412 units.\nStill, the shores of Lake Washington are attracting the bulk of the attention. The Seattle Seahawks football team, owned by Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, plans to start building a 145,155-square-foot training center and headquarters -- triple the size of its site in Kirkland -- on 19 acres Mr. Allen owns.\nThey will have bigger workout spaces, room for up to 3,000 fans for spring training and enough space to bring all 115 employees under one roof. As it is, players sometimes have to do stretches in the locker rooms and do hurdling drills in the hallways at Kirkland, said Lance Lopes, the team's general counsel and vice president.\nSouth of the Seahawks site, Conner Homes has broken ground for Barbee Mill, a collection of 114 luxury homes from $800,000 to about $3 million, on the site of a former lakefront sawmill. Homes will range from 2,500 to 4,000 square feet. The site is near a former creosote plant declared a Superfund site for toxic-waste cleanup last year, but Charlie Conner, president of Conner Homes, said the location was worth it.\n''Where else can you build a new community on the shores of Lake Washington?'' Mr. Conner said. ''This is probably the last big piece with large square footage on the lake.''\nFarther down the lake near the Boeing plant, Seco Development is renewing work on its Southport mixed-use complex and putting up 195 apartments. Michael Christ, Seco's president, mothballed work on three office towers and a 220-room hotel five years ago when the office market declined. Encouraged by the Seahawks move and the improving office market, he is looking for partners so he can go ahead with the office and hotel spaces.\n''Renton is coming into its own,'' Mr. Christ said. ''Rents here are finally coming to a point where it justifies building. It feels more real than it has for a long time.''\nDirecting growth to Boeing's old property and downtown has had another benefit: it lets the city comply with the state's Growth Management Act without altering the character of its single-family neighborhoods. The law requires every city in the state to plan for denser growth.\nRenton is not without its challenges. It has the busiest stretch of I-405 and the most congested interchange in the region. A proposed $1 billion in road improvements may relieve some of the congestion, if voters approve a gasoline tax next fall.\nThe Landing's construction may also be delayed. A group of residents is challenging whether city zoning rules allow it to be built, and the Westfield Group, an Australian mall developer, has joined the opposition. The company operates nearby Westfield Southcenter, which broke ground on a 400,000-square-foot expansion in May, and may compete against the Landing for tenants. The projects are expected to be completed by mid-2008 into early 2009.\nBut Renton is not betting solely on new projects. Boeing says it has no plans to depart. The growing number of low-fare airlines and a weak dollar have bolstered orders for the 737 and made it the company's most popular model. Through Dec. 20, Boeing sold 619 of the jetliners.\n''The 737 is very much alive and well,'' said Edmund S. Greenslet, publisher of the Airline Monitor in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. ''Maybe in five to eight years from now there will be a new model, but it very likely will be built in Renton.''\nSquare Feet

1816093	Amgen Acquires Option For a Heart Failure Drug	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE4DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Making a further move into the market for cardiovascular drugs, the biotechnology giant Amgen has formed an alliance with Cytokinetics, a smaller company developing an experimental drug to treat heart failure.\nUnder the agreement, which is expected to be announced this morning, Amgen will pay Cytokinetics $75 million to gain an option on the drug, which is about to enter the second of three stages of clinical trials.\nCytokinetics, which is based in South San Francisco, Calif., could eventually receive additional payments of more than $600 million, plus royalties, if the drug reaches the market and has significant sales.\nAmgen does not sell any drugs for heart diseases, but it is in late-stage trials of an anemia drug, Aranesp, as a treatment for heart failure.\nOne uncertainty, however, is that a recent study in kidney disease patients showed overuse of drugs like Aranesp could actually cause heart problems.\nAbout five million Americans suffer from heart failure, in which the heart does not pump blood adequately. The disease is the leading cause of hospitalization among those over 65.\nDr. Roger Perlmutter, executive vice president for research and development at Amgen, said his company had become intrigued with Cytokinetics' approach.\n''It's not been an area where there's been an enormous number of mechanistically new opportunities,'' Dr. Perlmutter said.\nThe drug, called CK-1827452, activates cardiac myosin, a protein that plays a central role in making heart muscles contract to pump blood.\nThe drug has not been tested in anyone with heart failure, only in healthy volunteers in Phase 1 studies designed primarily to test safety. But the president of Cytokinetics, Robert I. Blum, said the drug did increase heart-contracting ability in the volunteers and worked in dogs with heart failure.\nThe agreement's terms reflect the uncertainty that the drug will get to market. Amgen's $75 million initial payment gives it only an option on the drug. After additional trials Amgen would have the right to take over development and commercialization of the drug for a payment of $50 million.\nThe initial $75 million payment will consist of $42 million in cash and the purchase of $33 million in Cytokinetics stock, giving Amgen roughly 7 percent of the smaller company. Amgen will pay $9.47 a share, a 27 percent premium to Cytokinetics' closing price on Friday.
1816094	Euro-Wary Slovenians Already Miss Their Tolar	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Ivanka Rihtar has seen four currencies come and go in Slovenia during her lifetime. Ms. Rihtar, a 70-year-old storekeeper, has little nostalgia for any of them today.\nSoon after she was born, Slovenia used occupation notes introduced during the occupation of Ljubljana by Axis forces during World War II. Next came the Yugoslav dinar, which was used for 45 years and was abandoned when Slovenia declared independence in 1991. Then, she said, Slovenes grew accustomed to using temporary tokens, issued by the government ahead of the creation of Slovenia's own currency, the tolar.\nSlovenia's adoption of the euro on Monday was one change too many for Ms. Rihtar, who works in Ljubljana's open-air fruit and vegetable market. She opposes the move, which made the former Yugoslav republic the first of the European Union's formerly Communist members to join the currency union.\n''We are an independent country,'' she lamented before the switch took place. ''We should have our own currency.''\nSuch skepticism about the euro -- which began circulating as notes and coins just five years ago, hailed with great fanfare as an economic means to unite the Continent -- is spreading across the European Union's newest member states, even though many of them once viewed adopting the euro as a badge of honor.\nNone of the recent entrants, except for Slovenia, are ready to join the euro zone. Half abandoned their entry plans over the last six months, and failed to produce new timetables for joining. The lack of progress reflects persistent fiscal problems and political opposition to the tough economic changes that euro entry demands.\nThe newcomers have also looked on with frustration as the older members have refused to loosen the rules to take into account the budget shortfalls and higher inflation rates caused by rapid growth after shedding decades of Communist rule.\nLithuania, one of the first of the newcomers to break with communism, hoped to adopt the euro on Monday, but it failed to meet the European Union's inflation test by 0.06 of a percentage point this summer. Poland failed to muster the political consensus in favor of joining, and is threatening to hold a referendum on the issue in 2010. Hungary, burdened by political instability, has abandoned its previous target of entering the euro zone in 2010. Even Estonia, a Baltic tiger lauded for its economic prowess, has decided to move back its entry date from 2008 to 2010.\nWhile the European Union's newcomers grapple with whether to join the euro club, those already in are having their own doubts. In Italy, France and the Netherlands, there has been a public backlash against a perceived rise in prices since the euro's introduction.\nIn France, Ségolène Royal, the Socialist presidential nominee, and her presumed main opponent on the right, Nicolas Sarkozy, have criticized the European Central Bank, which is responsible for setting monetary policy for the 12 countries that use the euro. Ms. Royal and Mr. Sarkozy have asserted that the bank is depressing growth by keeping interest rates too high. French officials recently suggested that countries should have a say over monetary policy, much to the annoyance of the bank, which regards its independence as sacrosanct.\nOfficial figures suggest that fears that the euro has made things more expensive are more imagined than real, though some merchants seized on the adoption of the currency to camouflage price increases for everyday items.\nFull-year inflation in euro zone countries was 2.2 percent in 2002, the year euro notes and coins were introduced, compared with 2.5 percent in 2001. Yet consumers across the euro zone complained of sudden price increases.\nSuch ambivalence has not gone away. Five years later, most Germans still long for their old currency, according to a recent poll by the market research firm Forsa. The poll, for Stern magazine and RTL television, showed that 58 percent of Germans would prefer the deutsche mark over the euro. In a recent survey by TNS-Sofres in France, 52 percent of those polled said giving up the franc had been ''quite bad'' or ''very bad'' for France, compared with 45 percent in 2003.\nIn Italy, a growing tide against the euro has led some politicians to call for the country to abandon the currency in a bid to restore Italy's sagging economic competitiveness.\nIn Slovenia, however, polls indicate that the euro is still generally embraced, in part because it represents a final break with the Communist past. Much of the population is already familiar with the currency from shopping trips to Austria and Italy. But pride in the country's readiness to join has been offset by fears that the euro will make life more expensive.\n''I think a lot of small things are going to be more expensive,'' said Bostjan Kozina, who owns a vegetable store. ''We won't raise here because there is too much competition, and people would notice straight away. But I think small things like coffee will go up.''\nTo try to assuage such concerns, the government has urged retailers not to raise prices. All goods on display in Slovenia since March have been priced in euros and tolars, and the dual pricing will remain in place until June.\nWhile Slovenians brace themselves for a change in their currency, some economists argue that the euro's successes are more symbolic than economic, and that it is misguided to push Eastern and Central European countries into joining a currency that has yet to yield the economic advantages its champions promised.\nRobin Shepherd, who is a trans-Atlantic fellow of the German Marshall Fund of the United States and is based in Bratislava, said the euro had provided no obvious economic benefits to the 12 countries that use it. By contrast, in Britain, which has clung fiercely to the pound, the economy has outperformed that of the euro zone in five of the seven full years of the euro's existence. (The euro was introduced as an accounting currency in 1999, with coins and notes first distributed in 2002.)\nOther critics of the euro add that the euro zone's one-size-fits-all monetary policy has proved too inflexible for countries growing at different speeds, while the euro has not managed to challenge the dollar as the world's reserve currency, though it is making gains and rose about 11 percent against the dollar in 2006.\nThe euro's defenders retort that the single currency has had the psychological effect of binding together the Continent, easing cross-border purchases for consumers and reducing the cost of transactions. They contend that the strict criteria for joining the euro club have motivated countries to strive for smaller budget deficits and lower inflation rates.\nThe discipline required for euro entry, for example, has helped Slovenia achieve steady growth of 4 percent a year, while managing to cut inflation to 2.3 percent, compared with 10 percent a decade ago.\nThere is a ''tendency to take the euro as a scapegoat, which is extraordinarily unjust, unfair and false,'' the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, recently told a committee of the European Parliament. Mr. Trichet added that the euro zone had achieved much better results in economic growth, job creation and inflation in the years since its introduction.\nWhatever the economic challenges of the euro, in Slovenia, the biggest problem consumers may face is learning to handle small change. The euro will be valued at 239 tolars, a rate that has been in place since 2004 but which does not lend itself to easy mathematical conversion.\nTo try to help Slovenians cope, the Bank of Slovenia sentfree calculators to 760,000 households.
1816095	Copyright Lawsuit Names Leading Technology Firms	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E3DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	In 1997, Jonathan T. Taplin, a veteran film and television producer, stood up at a cable industry convention and asserted that in the future all movies would be distributed over the Internet. He recalls being laughed out of the room.\nMr. Taplin may laugh last. Online distribution of movies has arrived, at places like Apple Computer's iTunes Store. And even though Mr. Taplin's own video-on-demand company, Intertainer, shut down operations five years ago, it says it deserves some credit -- and cash.\nLast week, Intertainer filed a broad lawsuit asserting that Apple, Google and Napster are infringing on a 2005 patent that covers the commercial distribution of audio and video over the Internet.\nFounded by Mr. Taplin and two other Hollywood entertainment executives in 1996, Intertainer developed technology to distribute movies on demand through cable and phone lines for viewing on televisions and personal computers. It gained investors including Intel, Microsoft, Sony, NBC and Comcast.\n''Intertainer was the leader of the idea of entertainment on demand over Internet platforms before Google was even thought up,'' said Mr. Taplin, now an adjunct professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. He and a secretary constitute the entire remaining staff of Intertainer.\nTheodore Stevenson, a partner at McKool Smith, the Dallas firm representing Intertainer, said the company filed suit against Apple, Google and Napster because they were perceived as leaders in the market for digital downloads. He declined to specify the damages that Intertainer was seeking.\nApple, Google and Napster all declined to comment on the lawsuit.\nIntertainer's tale is somewhat different than other intellectual property suits brought by technology licensing firms. By 2002 the company seemed to have a growing business, with 125,000 Internet subscribers for its servers and 35,000 TV subscribers through the Comcast cable system.\nBut in the fall of 2002, the company shut down its service and filed a lawsuit against some of the backers of Movielink, a competitor backed by five Hollywood studios, including Sony, Universal and Warner Brothers. At the time Mr. Taplin said the studios were using Movielink as a price-fixing vehicle to kill Intertainer.\nAn antitrust investigation by the Justice Department into Movielink was dropped in 2004.\nThe studios settled the lawsuit last March for an undisclosed sum, and Mr. Taplin said in a phone interview Tuesday that Intertainer would henceforth pursue a patent licensing business.\nThe company holds nine patents, including United States Patent No. 6,925,469, which was issued in 2005 and is intended to cover the management and distribution of digital media from various suppliers.\nDespite initial backing from Microsoft and Intel, Mr. Taplin said the two companies were not involved in the decision to bring the Apple, Google and Napster lawsuit. He said that decision was made by Intertainer's board and that none of his original corporate backers have board seats. Several of the company's original investors have taken patent licenses, he said, but he would not name the companies.\nDespite the company's decision to file the case in a federal district court in Texas that has traditionally looked favorably on plaintiffs in patent lawsuits, several digital media experts said that Intertainer might have a difficult time enforcing its patent because of its relatively recent filing date of 2001.\nBy that time, for example, Real Networks, the Seattle-based pioneer in streaming digital media, had begun an Internet subscription service for digital content.\nLegal experts said it was difficult to handicap Intertainer's claims. ''There are so many of these lawsuits nowadays,'' said Eric Goldman, director the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University School of Law. ''It is hard to figure out which ones are a serious threat and which ones are not.''\nMr. Goldman also said it was unclear what specific technology or service was covered by the Intertainer patent.\n''I have the same problem with this patent as so many of the patents of the dot-com boom days: I don't know what it means,'' Mr. Goldman said.\nMr. Stevenson, the Intertainer lawyer, said the patent covers a system that can be used by content owners to upload their content and used by consumers to download it. ''It is pretty basic to the architecture of digital content delivery nowadays,'' he said.\nMr. Taplin, who once worked as a road manager for Bob Dylan and produced several movies, including ''Mean Streets,'' ''The Last Waltz'' and ''To Die For,'' has a history of activism on technology issues. In 2002, he encouraged those attending a technology conference to urge the Federal Communications Commission to ensure that broadband providers would not be able to block specific Web sites -- an early version of a hot-button issue that has become known as network neutrality.\nEarlier that year, he testified before the Senate against legislation that would have forced high-tech manufacturers to incorporate technology to prevent piracy in their software and hardware.\nCorrection: January 4, 2007, Thursday A headline in Business Day yesterday about a lawsuit brought by Intertainer, a digital media company, against Apple Computer, Google and Napster misstated the nature of the litigation. It involves a patent, not a copyright.
1816096	SoHo Bounces Back As a Fashion Center	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E3DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Before Sept. 11, 2001, SoHo seemed on the way to emerging as one of the most prestigious shopping districts in Manhattan. But after the attack on the World Trade Center, many retailers eventually left their stores after it appeared that shoppers had abandoned the district.\nNow, SoHo is on the rise again, particularly among foreign clothing retailers seeking to establish stores in New York.\n''We're seeing this comeback,'' said Yair H. Staav, a senior managing director with the Lansco Corporation. ''It's a major vote of confidence in SoHo as a fashion location.''\nMr. Staav and another senior managing director with Lansco, Christine Emery, both retail specialists in the SoHo area, recently assisted the landlord at 92 Greene Street, a 50,000-square-foot loft condominium building under construction on a former parking lot, in two leasing transactions with foreign designers. Evisu, a Japanese jeans maker, took 3,200 square feet, and Cotélac, a French women's clothier, leased 2,500 square feet.\nThe asking annual rent for both spaces was about $200 a foot. ''Just two years ago, the area was dead,'' Ms. Emery said. ''Now we're seeing a return to pre-9/11 rents,'' which were about $500,000 a year for a 3,500- to 4,000-square-foot space on Greene Street.\nStill, rents are affordable enough for a group of funky foreign clothing designers to set up shop in a neighborhood abandoned by many luxury designer retailers, like the British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, H. Stern and Cartier.\nThe area's comeback started in 2003, when furniture designers began taking large spaces on lower Greene Street as far south as Canal Street, lured by reduced rents, brokers said. Then came an infusion of sports retailers like the sunglass designer Oakley, the surfing and snowboarding outfitter Quiksilver and the snowboarding retailer Burton.\nNow fashion is venturing back -- though perhaps in somewhat less high-end forms than was there in early 2001, brokers said. Recent additions include the British designer Paul Smith, at 142 Greene Street, and the designer Karen Millen, at 112 Prince Street. AG Adriano Goldschmied, a denim designer, took space at 111 Greene Street, and Zinco, an Italian knitwear designer, has opened at 85 Mercer Street. An international women's shoe designer, Té Casan, has moved into 382 West Broadway.\nThe new stores' wares are not as expensive as those seen in Madison Avenue shops, said Christopher Owles, a principal at Sinvin Realty, who placed A Bathing Ape, a cult Japanese fashion label, at 91 Greene Street, in the spring of 2004.\nMr. Owles said there had been a small invasion of Japanese designers in SoHo recently. Fith, a Japanese children's clothing maker, recently leased 900 square feet at 65 West Houston Street, and Psny, a Japanese designer of fashionable baby slings, took 500 square feet of space at 69 West Houston. As of late December, a Japanese hat manufacturer was poised to lease 350 square feet at 75 West Houston, Mr. Owles said.\nBesides fashion designers, foreign designers of home furnishings have also been flocking in, brokers say. Two new ones are Alessi, an Italian housewares designer, which recently opened at 130 Greene Street, near the industrial design store Moss, and Bo Concept, a Danish retail furniture chain that bills itself as an affordable home furnishing designer, at 69 Greene Street.\nBo Concept's SoHo store will be a flagship -- the chain's largest outlet, against which the success of all others will be measured -- even though the chain has had a popular store in Chelsea for almost two years, said the manager, Luis Rojas.\n''A lot of people have lofts around here and open spaces, and our furniture goes well with open spaces,'' he said. ''And there are lots of furniture stores in this area, such as Natuzzi and Armani Casa.''\nStill, Mr. Rojas said, the new store, open only three months, is still gauging the market. There has been a lot of tourist foot traffic, he said, almost as much, on weekends, as in Chelsea, but there has been less buying.\nThe asking rent for Bo Concept's almost 7,000 square feet was $385,000 a year, which works out to about $55 a foot. That rent was negotiated last spring, and since then, rents have jumped, Mr. Staav said.\nRecently, a space next door, at 71 Greene Street, that is the mirror image of Bo Concept's space, was offered. It is occupied by Phi, a clothing designer led by Susan Dell, the wife of the computer maker Michael S. Dell, and the lease was offered for about $450,000 a year, Mr. Staav said, meaning that since last spring, rents have increased almost 17 percent. (Phi, which had contemplated leaving the space, has decided to stay, though no contract has been signed, brokers said.)\nRobert Zeisel, who owns both 69 and 71 Greene Street, is optimistic enough to convert the space occupied by his own business, the B & Z Steel Equipment Company, across the street at 78 Greene Street, into a retail space. B & Z is one of the last operating businesses from the 1950s in what used to be an industrial neighborhood. Despite landing jobs framing SoHo's designer showrooms, Mr. Zeisel said he preferred to move his headquarters to his Brooklyn office.\nMs. Emery said the invasion of foreign designers extended to Broadway, where Uniqlo, the competitively priced Japanese clothier seeking to give stores like Gap and Banana Republic a run for their money, has moved into 546 Broadway. Last March, the company took about 50,000 square feet, including basement space, at an asking rent of $3.5 million, or roughly $70 a foot.\nFoot traffic, largely driven by tourism, is crucial to SoHo's appeal for foreign retailers, which are often seeking a strong branding opportunity, brokers said. Susan Penzner of Susan Penzner Real Estate, which helped Paul Smith find his showroom, said the neighborhood was seeing a resurgence because the home furnishing and industrial design industry, which started down on Grand Street, is spreading north into more expensive storefronts.\n''Greene Street is now the design street,'' she said, noting the recent opening of B&B Italia, a furniture maker, at 137 Greene Street between Prince and Houston Streets. ''There are tons of people on the weekends. And I count shopping bags -- not the people carrying only coffee cups.''\nSQUARE FEET
1816097	Qualcomm Under Scrutiny By Korean Antitrust Agency	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E3DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	The South Korean antitrust agency has formed a task force to investigate the licensing and business practices of the wireless technology company Qualcomm, the latest in a string of legal battles for the company, officials said on Tuesday.\nIn Japan, Europe and the United States, Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, faces accusations by rivals that it has abused its market dominance in wireless technology to demand excessive royalties and block fair competition.\nQualcomm is known for developing code-division multiple access, or CDMA, wireless technology, which is a rival standard to the global system for mobile communications, or GSM, technology. It makes money by selling chips that power cellphones, as well as collecting royalties or licensing its technology to other chip makers and cellphone manufacturers.\nThe creation of a task force, which is modeled after the one investigating antitrust complaints against Microsoft, means that the case in question merits a full-blown investigation, said Na Yang-ju, a spokesman for the South Korean antitrust watchdog agency, the Fair Trade Commission.\nBut commission officials also acknowledged that the case against Qualcomm was more complicated than they had expected. A year ago, the commission ruled that Microsoft was guilty of breaching fair trade rules, a decision the company is appealing.\n''We have been investigating Qualcomm's case since last April but we have found it to be a complicated case where facts are difficult to establish,'' a commission investigator, Lee Seung-kyu, said.\nSouth Korea is home to several leading mobile phone makers as well as smaller companies that provide technology and components. More than 80 percent of the country's 48 million people carry cellphones, all based on Qualcomm technology.\n''Companies here have constantly complained about Qualcomm demanding too much royalty,'' said Kevin Lee, an industry analyst at Woori Investment and Securities in Seoul.\n''The investigation can be seen as political pressure on Qualcomm to be more friendly toward South Korean companies which use its technology,'' Mr. Lee added.\nExecutives at the company said they had no comment because they had not yet received official queries from the Fair Trade Commission.\nInvestigators from the commission searched Qualcomm Korea's two offices in April, seeking data on Qualcomm's business dealings with Samsung, LG and Pantech.\nQualcomm Korea said it was standing by a statement issued in April by its parent that its ''business practices are lawful and procompetitive.''\nThe investigation into Qualcomm was set off last year by complaints from Nextreaming and Thin Multimedia, two South Korean companies that make software that allows cellphone users to download music, surf the Internet and display video over high-speed cellular networks.\nLim Il-tiek, president of Nextreaming, accused Qualcomm of undermining fair competition by bundling its multimedia software into its market-dominant cellphone chip sets.\nCorrection: January 5, 2007, Friday An article in Business Day on Wednesday about an investigation of Qualcomm by the antitrust authorities in South Korea misspelled the given name of the president of Nextreaming, which has accused Qualcomm of undermining fair competition. It is Lim Il-taek, not Lim Il-tiek.

1816099	After Bringing Adu to Utah, Checketts Wants Him to Stay	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E1DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Few people would accuse Dave Checketts of not thinking ahead, whether in the N.B.A., the N.H.L. or M.L.S.\n''When I hired my coach, John Ellinger, two and a half years ago, one of the reasons I hired him was because I knew Freddy wanted to play for him,'' Checketts, the founder and chairman of SCP Worldwide, said in a recent interview in his Manhattan offices, referring to his Real Salt Lake soccer club. ''We were thinking about this years ago.''\n''This'' was Real Salt Lake's acquisition of Freddy Adu, the 17-year-old midfield prodigy, from D.C. United of Major League Soccer last month. Adu's contract with M.L.S., which pays him $500,000 a year, runs though the end of 2007 and includes a two-year option, held by the league. One of the worst-kept secrets in soccer is that Adu has his heart set on playing in Europe, possibly in England's Premier League, one day. If it is up to Checketts, that day will not come soon.\n''First of all, he's going to play a lot for us,'' Checketts said. ''We'll see what he's really made of and what he'll develop into. It's a gamble. But the notion at 18 that he's ready for the E.P.L., I'll take that bet. I don't think he is ready. I think he needs multiple seasons in Salt Lake, at least. He may think he needs less.''\nAdu played for Ellinger as a member of the United States under-17 team, and Adu said that was one of the reasons he was so excited about his move west. Late last year, Adu spent two weeks in England training with Manchester United's reserve team, a stint that smacked more of marketing. (Adu is sponsored by Nike, which also sponsors United.)\n''He has to play and he has to play well under any scenario,'' Checketts said. ''Freddy plays well, the kids in Salt Lake can relate. He's not 6-9, and he can actually be a bigger fish, even though he was a pretty big fish in D.C. Now he's an R.S.L. guy. He's going to be very big there.''\nON THE MOVE -- A new year, a new transfer frenzy in Europe. The so-called transfer window has opened, and clubs big and small are searching for the players who can change fortunes and shore up weaknesses.\nIn West London, Fulham is inching closer to signing the American midfielder Clint Dempsey, who needs only the British government's approval of his work permit to complete the move. Dempsey's transfer from the New England Revolution will bring M.L.S. the largest transfer fee in its history -- $4 million, according to a league official who said he was not authorized to speak publicly about the transaction. M.L.S. was paid $3 million by Manchester United in 2003 for Tim Howard and $3.5 million by Nottingham Forest in 1999 for Stern John.\n''Clint's a wide player up front, can play either flank, strong with pace, a good player, good touch,'' Fulham Manager Chris Coleman told The Boston Globe about Dempsey, who played three seasons for the Revolution. ''He has all the attributes to be a good player in the Premier League, is the right age and was in our price range.''\nDempsey, 23, scored the only goal for the United States at last summer's World Cup in Germany.\nReading, another E.P.L. club, denied yesterday that it was close to acquiring Eddie Johnson, a 22-year-old striker who played for the Kansas City Wizards last season. Johnson trained with the club in November. ''Nothing is happening there,'' Andy West, a Reading spokesman, told yanks-abroad.com. ''I think somebody made that story up having seen he had been training with us recently, and put two and two together.''\nIn Spain, the metrosexual world awaits news about David Beckham's future at Real Madrid. An English midfielder, Beckham is not a favorite of Coach Fabio Capello, and he can now seek a deal with another club, which would have to pay a hefty transfer fee. (Real Madrid paid Manchester United $48 million for Beckham in 2003.)\nBeckham, 31, could wait until June and join a club like the Los Angeles Galaxy of M.L.S. on a free transfer. Real Madrid is also reportedly seeking the 23-year-old midfielder Franck Ribéry, one of the stars for France in the World Cup.\nUNITED STATES -- Bob Bradley, the interim coach of the men's national team, was in the Netherlands over the holidays to see his son, Michael, play for Heerenveen, and to perhaps twist some arms gently.\nThe younger Bradley, a talented midfielder, is being sought by Thomas Rongen, the coach of the American under-20 national team. The team is scheduled to play Haiti, Guatemala and host Panama this month as it tries to qualify for this summer's world championship in Canada.\nRongen has pried one player from Heerenveen, midfielder Robbie Rogers, and has held off announcing his final roster for qualifying, waiting for word on the availability of Bradley and striker Johann Smith, who is with Bolton in England. The American team is training in Bradenton, Fla.\n''With more and more of our youth national team players abroad, we are entering into an area that is similar to what our senior national team encounters on a frequent basis, and that is the challenge of getting players released,'' Rongen said in a statement.\nSOCCER REPORT
1816100	A Time of Temptation For the Thrifty of Ireland	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE1DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	A government effort to cool Ireland's roaring economy by encouraging people to save is threatening to backfire.\nIn 2001, Ireland encouraged citizens to set money aside each month in special accounts by offering to match a portion of those savings. The catch was that savers had to lock up their money for five years.\nAbout 1.1 million Irish savers -- or 40 percent of the adult population -- amassed 16 billion euros ($21 billion) in savings, a sum that is about 10 percent of the country's annual gross domestic product.\nBut now that the five years are over, the wealth is being unleashed, and the plan may do exactly what it was meant to prevent: add fuel to the economy of one of the most competitive and fastest-growing countries in Europe.\nThe expected outcome underscores the trickiness in taming surging economies -- a task that the authorities in China are grappling with. It could also serve as a case study for countries, like the United States, which are looking for ways to motivate spendthrift consumers to save more to rebalance their economies.\nEdel Byrne, 30, an operations director for a large chain of restaurants in Dublin, is looking forward to spending the 20,000 euros she will have accumulated when the five-year lockup ends in the spring. She has her eyes on a Marni handbag -- the line sells on the Internet for 280 to 1,060 euros -- and airline tickets to Rio de Janeiro, Milan and Paris. She plans to spend some of what is left on a house that she recently bought in the Dublin suburbs.\nIn 2002, Ms. Byrne would never have dreamed of setting aside as much as 254 euros each month for five years if the government had not made it worth her while: It gave her one euro for every four she paid into her so-called Special Savings Incentive Account, or S.S.I.A.\nFor Ms. Byrne, the government incentive was worth 63.50 euros each month. Her own monthly payments, the government bonus and the interest she earned were not accessible as the savings accumulated.\nSome of the accounts have already matured since the program opened in May 2001. But most savers, who on average have accumulated 15,000 euros, according to industry estimates, delayed opening the accounts until the months before enrollment ended in April 2002.\nThe freed savings will come on top of an estimated 5 billion euros in increased public spending and tax cuts that the Irish government plans to pump into the economy in 2007, an election year.\nIf the Irish choose to spend their savings over a few months rather than tap the personal wealth pool over two or three years, inflation, especially for services like hotels and restaurants, could accelerate at a time when prices are already rising rapidly.\n''The 16 billion euros is a phenomenal amount of money,'' said Jim Power, chief economist at Friends First, a pension and investment firm in Dublin. ''There is of course an inflationary risk. There is already an inflationary risk notwithstanding the S.S.I.A. effect.''\nThe savings plan was devised by Charlie McCreevy, the Irish finance minister at the time and now the European Union's commissioner for the internal market, who wanted to tame a potential threat of inflation to the Irish economy.\nIn 2000, consumer prices in Ireland rose 5.6 percent. That figure had moderated to 2.5 percent for 2005, but it started creeping up again in 2006, to a 4.4 percent pace in November, and is expected to stay relatively high at about 3.5 percent in 2007, according to some economists who fear the bounty from the savings accounts could inject too much money into the economy over a short period.\nBut nobody really knows what will happen, which is why there have been widespread surveys of the intentions of savers like Ms. Byrne.\nBanks eager to hold on to the large sums are offering new but less generous saving products. Savers whose special accounts have already matured appear to be taking their time in deciding what to do with the money.\nSimilar savings plans by other European governments have not been as popular, probably because the cash incentives were much less generous than those offered by the Irish plan. In Britain, for example, tax-efficient savings plans like Individual Savings Accounts, or I.S.A.'s, operate through the tax system rather than with cash incentives.\nConsumer spending in Ireland is less than 50 percent of gross domestic product, low by European standards, according to Dan McLaughlin, chief economist at Bank of Ireland. According to the Irish Central Statistics Office, the country had a household savings rate of 11.9 percent of income in 2003, compared with 2.1 percent in the United States and 11.1 percent in France.\nOn Grafton Street, one of central Dublin's main shopping streets, evidence of the usual seasonal surge in spending has not been hard to detect. But whether spending will be further fueled as Irish consumers anticipate tapping their savings is difficult to judge, said Stephen Sealey, a buying director for the department store Brown Thomas. It sells Hermès handbags for as much as 10,000 euros ($13,200) and Chanel watches for 7,500 euros ($9,940).\n''Over the last four years, we have seen a steady growth in luxury goods,'' he said, adding that buoyant consumer spending ''is driving double-digit year-on-year growth across the business.''\nMr. McLaughlin, at Bank of Ireland, said that surveys by his bank indicated that a slice of the special accounts would be spent on foreign holidays and home renovations. He forecast that spending from the accounts would help support the economy over the next three or four years at a time when rising interest rates are adding to the costs of housing.\nBut if Ms. Byrne is any indication, not all the money will be spent.\n''The Irish are good at treating themselves these days, but I would feel guilty to spend over half the amount on luxuries,'' she said. ''I do not think you should just throw away five years of hard savings.''
1816101	Protecting Internet Democracy	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E0DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	One of the big winners in the last election may turn out to be the principle, known as net neutrality, that Internet service providers should not be able to favor some content over others. Democrats who are moving into the majority in Congress -- led by Ron Wyden in the Senate and Edward Markey in the House -- say they plan to fight hard to pass a net neutrality bill, and we hope that they do. It is vital to preserve the Internet's role in promoting entrepreneurship and free expression.\nInternet users now get access to any Web site on an equal basis. Foreign and domestic sites, big corporate home pages and little-guy blogs all show up on a user's screen in the same way when their addresses are typed into a browser. Anyone who puts up a Web page can broadcast it to the world.\nCable and telephone companies are talking, however, about creating a two-tiered Internet with a fast lane and a slow lane. Companies that pay hefty fees would have their Web pages delivered to Internet users in the current speedy fashion. Companies and individuals that do not would be relegated to the slow lane.\nCreating these sorts of tiers would destroy the democratic quality of the Internet. Big, wealthy voices would start to overpower the smaller, poorer ones. Innovation would be threatened if start-ups and small companies could not afford the new fees. The next eBay or Google might never be born.\nA net neutrality law would require cable and telephone companies to continue to provide Web sites to Internet users on an equal basis. Mr. Markey, of Massachusetts, will be taking over a key subcommittee that handles Internet issues. He has promised to hold hearings to educate Congress and the public, and to reintroduce his strong net neutrality bill. Mr. Wyden, of Oregon, plans to reintroduce an equally solid bill in the Senate.\nPassing the legislation will not be easy. The cable and telephone companies have fought net neutrality with a lavishly financed and misleading lobbying campaign, because they stand to gain an enormous windfall. But there is growing support from individuals and groups across the political spectrum, from MoveOn.org to the Gun Owners of America, who worry about what will happen to their free speech if Internet service providers are allowed to pick and choose the traffic they carry.\nIn the last week, there was a limited but important victory for net neutrality. As a condition of approving the AT&T-BellSouth merger, the Federal Communications Commission required AT&T to guarantee net neutrality on its broadband service for the next two years. The commission was right to extract this concession, but it should not be necessary to negotiate separate deals like this one. On the information superhighway, net neutrality should be a basic rule of the road.\nEditorial
1816102	After the Rip van Winkle Years	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E0DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	The mood at Eliot Spitzer's Jan. 1 inauguration was exuberant, and that was hardly surprising. Few politicians are offered the opportunity that greets Mr. Spitzer as he becomes New York's 54th governor.\nMr. Spitzer, who has built his career on reform, is arriving in a state capital that desperately needs it. The comptroller was forced to resign after pleading guilty to a felony. The Senate majority leader is being investigated by the F.B.I. for his outside consulting work. Another state senator is charged with stealing state money, and it took a state judge to force legislators to reveal how they spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxpayer money.\nNew York's government has slipped from a beacon for other states into a cautionary tale. So when Mr. Spitzer spoke of change in his inaugural address -- an end to government ''that works for those who hold office, not those who put them there'' -- he hit precisely the right note. With a passion and energy that Albany has not seen in years, this governor has promised to wake what he has labeled the ''Rip van Winkle'' government of the last decade.\nMr. Spitzer started on the right foot by issuing five executive orders to upgrade the ethics of the executive branch with rules that should go without saying, but in Albany never do -- like not using state property or personnel for personal use, and not taking gifts from people who do business with the state.\nBy cleaning his own house first, Mr. Spitzer will have the moral high ground as he does battle to get New York's recalcitrant lawmakers to do the same. After years of mostly dozing off, they require a long list: redistricting reform, campaign finance reform, ethics reform, and budget reform, including more sunlight on how $114 billion a year is being spent.\nGetting reform through the Legislature will be hard enough, but Mr. Spitzer faces equally tough challenges in dealing with budget deficits and education needs and keeping the state's high taxes in check. In his inaugural address, he pointedly said that he does not believe in ''government as a heavy hand that can cure all our ills,'' a sign that some of his Democratic allies might not have as much clout as they are expecting.\nMr. Spitzer began setting his new tone on day one, with his ''people's inauguration.'' The official swearing-in was outdoors, public invited. He threw open the governor's mansion for the first time since most people waiting in line could remember. Instead of a fancy ball for fat-cat contributors, he spent the night of his inauguration at a free concert by James Taylor and other crowd favorites.\nFor the first time in years, we see a figure poised to rattle Albany's do-little establishment, to air out a dark, closed government and to try to convert New York's Legislature to the higher purposes of public service. New Yorkers can only hope Mr. Spitzer makes it all happen.\nEditorial
1816103	A Light Bulb Goes On	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E0DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Bad habits can be hard to break. So it's great news that Wal-Mart is putting its considerable heft behind one of the easiest ways to reduce energy consumption and the production of global-warming gases: the corkscrew-shaped light bulbs of the future.\nLight bulbs don't have tailpipes to remind us that their use adds to pollution. But more than half of the nation's electricity comes from coal-burning plants. Switching from familiar bulbs to longer-lasting, energy-saving compact fluorescent lamps makes sense economically and environmentally.\nAs Michael Barbaro reported in The Times yesterday, Wal-Mart is pushing to sell 100 million compact fluorescents a year. Because they use 75 percent less electricity, that would save customers $3 billion on their electricity bills and save the world from 20 million metric tons of greenhouse gases.\nBut it will also take a lot of work to persuade consumers to make the change. There's the strange shape and the general lack of familiarity, of course, but probably the biggest impediment is that while the bulbs are cheaper to use, they cost more to buy. Compact fluorescents are often eight times more expensive, but each one saves consumers $30 over its lifespan because they last longer and use less electricity. It's a quirk of our human brains that people generally have a hard time paying more for something today even if it's a better deal in the long run. That will take some work to overcome.\nThe poorest consumers -- those who are behind on their bills and living paycheck to paycheck -- may not be able to absorb the extra cost upfront. Every effort should be made to get the bulbs for those who need them most, including expanding programs to distribute them to recipients of energy-assistance programs for the poor.\nEditorial
1816104	Now It's Belarus's Turn	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E0DC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	A year after Russia put the gas squeeze on Ukraine, it was Belarus's turn. Unlike Ukraine, Belarus blinked two minutes before the Jan. 1 deadline and Russia had its booty: a 50 percent share of Belarus's pipeline network and a more than doubling of the price Belarus will now pay for Russian gas.\nThere was no global outcry this time. President Aleksandr Lukashenko, the utterly Soviet boss of Belarus, has no friends in the West. But this latest squeeze is another warning that the Kremlin will let nothing -- personal loyalty, contracts, the law -- halt its drive to reimpose state control on Russia's energy sector. It is also another reminder that the West, a big consumer of Russian energy, remains vulnerable to President Vladimir Putin's whims.\nThe Belarus deal came less than two weeks after Royal Dutch Shell gave in to the Kremlin's pressure and sold a controlling share in the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project to Gazprom, Russia's state gas monopoly. Moscow is now leaning on the British-Russian joint venture, TNK-BP, to give Gazprom a large and possibly controlling stake.\nA year ago, when the democratic revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine were seen as serious threats to the Kremlin's influence, Mr. Putin was eager to prop up Mr. Lukashenko. But once Mr. Lukashenko successfully stole the March presidential election, the new gas bill arrived in Minsk. That included half ownership for the Kremlin of Beltransgaz, the state pipeline operator that not only fuels Belarus but also supplies a fifth of Europe's gas.\nRussia's European customers could increase their leverage -- and possibly improve the Kremlin's behavior -- if they negotiated jointly with Gazprom, rather than scurrying to cut separate deals.

But the same economic forces driving students with privileged backgrounds to compete for admission to public universities threaten middle- and lower-income students' access to public and private institutions alike.\nCongress recently responded by extending the tax deduction for families' tuition expenses, and New York's private colleges and universities have made a fourfold increase in grants, to more than $2 billion annually, since 1990. Yet New York State's tuition-assistance program raised its top student-aid levels by just 21 percent over that time period. For the last five years, neither that program nor the federal Pell grant program has raised top awards at all.\nPolicy makers must reinvigorate their commitment to the public-private partnership so future generations can achieve their goals for a higher education.\nGale Stevens Haynes Provost, Long Island University Brooklyn Campus Brooklyn, Dec. 22, 2006

We hear that he was his own person and didn't need ''handlers'' to tell him how to behave.\nWe hear about his humility and his lack of need for ''celebrity.''

Soon, a fragile Iraqi government might succumb to pressure and ''commute'' his sentence, even free him.\nThen, he reorganizes his Tikrit gangsters and Baath Party and stages a comeback. Or his followers could achieve a jailbreak. Far-fetched? Napoleon did it.\nNo, a living Saddam Hussein was too dangerous.

1816110	Blair's Deputy Calls Taunting of Hussein at Execution 'Deplorable'	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506EFDC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Britain's deputy prime minister said Tuesday that the taunting and baiting that accompanied Saddam Hussein's execution was unacceptable and that the people responsible should be condemned for taking part.\n''I think the manner was quite deplorable, really,'' said the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. ''I don't think one can endorse in any way that, whatever your views about capital punishment.''\nResponding to the murky scenes that emerged after the execution showing witnesses and guards chanting and telling Saddam to ''go to hell'' as his executioners prepared to hang him, Mr. Prescott added: ''Frankly, to get that kind of recorded messages coming out is totally unacceptable, and I think whoever is involved and responsible for it should be ashamed of themselves.''\nBut in a terse exchange with an interviewer on BBC radio, Mr. Prescott refused to be drawn into criticizing the Iraqi government, which had custody of Mr. Hussein and which arranged his execution. ''If they are responsible, I pass my comment and that's where I stand,'' he said.\nImages of Mr. Hussein with a noose around his neck have been plastered across newspapers and shown on television all weekend here. In a country implacably opposed to the death penalty, the sight has been shocking, as was the speed with which it was carried out.\nPrime Minister Tony Blair, on vacation in Florida, has not spoken publicly about Mr. Hussein's death, an omission that has been seized on by antiwar members of his Labor Party as another misstep in a long succession of them on Iraq. But the foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, released a statement last week saying that while she welcomed the fact that Saddam had been tried and ''held to account,'' the British government had made it clear that it opposed the death penalty.\n''We have made our position very clear to the Iraqi authorities, but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation,'' she said. Asked if the government had also complained to the Iraqis about how the execution was carried out, Mr. Prescott repeated what Ms. Beckett had said.\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ

Chief Invites Controversy by Declining to Oppose Hussein Execution	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02EFDC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	On his first day of work as secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the mild-spoken South Korean diplomat who had suggested he would bring new caution to the post, invited controversy by declining to criticize the death penalty applied to Saddam Hussein.\nMr. Ban commented on the execution of Mr. Hussein just after entering United Nations headquarters on Tuesday morning to start his job.\n''Saddam Hussein was responsible for committing heinous crimes and unspeakable atrocities against the Iraqi people,'' Mr. Ban said in response to questions from a crush of reporters outside the Security Council's chambers. ''We should never forget the victims of his crimes, '' he said.\n''The issue of capital punishment is for each and every member state to decide,'' he added.\n''While I am firmly against impunity, I also hope the members of the international community should pay due regard to all aspects of international humanitarian laws.''\nMr. Ban's remarks appeared to contradict bedrock United Nations policy opposing the death penalty on human rights grounds.\nHe seemed to have tripped in his effort to tread lightly on the political views of the many United Nations members.\nThe remarks also seemed to show that Mr. Ban, who was South Korea's foreign minister when he was chosen in October as secretary general, had not completed the transition from representing his country to leading the United Nations.\nMichèle Montas, Mr. Ban's spokeswoman, said the death penalty was legal in South Korea.\nOn Dec. 30, hours after Mr. Hussein was hanged, the United Nations special representative for Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, said in Baghdad that although the United Nations ''understands the desire for justice felt by many Iraqis,'' it could not support the execution.\n''Based on the principle of respect for the right to life,'' Mr. Qazi said, ''the United Nations remains opposed to capital punishment, even in the case of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.''\nMs. Montas, whose first day on the job also was Tuesday, said Mr. Ban had not intended to change United Nations policy, but had added his own ''nuance.'' Mr. Hussein was hanged in a hasty execution at dawn on Dec. 30, in a chamber where many Iraqis had been killed under his brutal rule.\nIn public comments before his first meeting with United Nations staff, Mr. Ban said, ''We have to show the international community that we are ready and eager to change.'' He said the organization had faced ''harsh and sometimes unfair criticism,'' and acknowledged that ''staff morale has plummeted.'' But he said United Nations workers must be ready to ''multitask'' and to move frequently from armchair jobs at headquarters in New York into the field.\n''My watchword will be meritocracy,'' he said, in words that should be well received by the Bush administration, which backed Mr. Ban to succeed Kofi Annan, who served two five-year terms, in part because of Mr. Ban's pledges to streamline the United Nations bureaucracy.\nIn veiled words, Mr. Ban seemed to hint that he would not overreach his power, but that he expected cooperation from the United States. Speaking of the many crises facing the organization, he said, ''Not a single person, including the secretary general of the United Nations; not a single country, however strong, powerful, resourceful, maybe, can address this.''\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ

The formal serenity of the service, disguised, but only barely, the virulent rivalries and envies and grudges and grievances that have roiled this group for many decades.\nNone of the eulogists noted the irony that the man who ushered out one long national nightmare had ushered in another, the one we're living in now. It was Gerald Ford, after all, who gave America the gift of Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld -- the gift that keeps on taking.\nThe two former Ford administration officials, who doomed Iraq to civil war and despoiled American values, were honorary pallbearers yesterday, as was that other slippery and solipsistic courtier, Henry Kissinger.\nThe group was even more on edge because of a remarkable trellis of peppery opinions that had tumbled out of the man in the coffin, posthumously. The late president, hailed as the most understated and decent guy in the world, had given a series of interviews on the condition that they be held until his death -- a belated but bracing smackdown of many of his distinguished mourners.\nIt was impossible not to wonder what the luminaries were truly thinking, as they sat listening to fugues of Bach and Brahms and encomiums to the ordinary-guy leader.\nNancy Reagan's imperturbable expression behind her big sunglasses did not disguise the gloating words visible in the bubble over her head: ''And they call this a funeral?''\nIt could not compare, of course, to the incredible Princess of Wales treatment that her husband had for his state funeral. And Nancy, hypersensitive to any slights to her Ronnie, would not have been pleased with Mr. Ford's interview with Michael Beschloss published in Newsweek, in which he blamed Ronald Reagan for costing him the 1976 election by challenging his nomination and then failing to hit the trail for him.\nIt was good of Mr. Ford to bring 41 and 43 together in a solemn respite from their uneasy competition over Iraq.\n''Told you so, you sons of guns -- we were right to stop at Safwan and stay out of Baghdad,'' the father's bubble read, as he watched Rummy and Henry the K, both of whom had treated Poppy with such veiled contempt, as though he were a feather duster. ''Those vicious Moktada-loving Shiites dancing around Saddam's dead body prove that Brent and I were right.''\nLynne Cheney glared at Poppy as he gave his eulogy, knowing that he privately thinks that the vice president has destroyed not only Iraq and American foreign policy, but the Bush family name. Her storm cloud of a bubble is expurgated.\nHillary's bubble was full of mockery for another New Yorker in the National Cathedral: ''You think you're so smart, Rudy, but you leave your entire presidential battle plan in a hotel room for your rivals to find? The victim role doesn't suit you.'' Condi's bubble was as opaquely dark as Hillary's was risibly light -- drooping with the inchoate fear that her nearby erstwhile mentor, Brent Scowcroft, had been right about Iraq after all.\nAs Poppy spoke from the altar, praising Mr. Ford's generosity, he must have been mulling that his predecessor was ungenerous in spitting on him from the grave. Mr. Ford told Mr. Beschloss that Bush Senior had sold out the party to the hard right and had taken a phony, pandering position on abortion.\nPoppy had to have enjoyed watching Dr. K get up and lavish praise on his old boss, after Mr. Ford had sniggered to Bob Woodward that the ''coy'' Bavarian diva had ''the thinnest skin of any public figure I ever knew.''\nW. graciously walked Betty Ford down the aisle, even as he must have curdled inside about her husband's telling Mr. Woodward that it had been ''a big mistake'' on the part of W., Dick Cheney and Rummy to justify the Iraq war with nonexistent W.M.D. ''I just don't think we should go hellfire damnation around the globe freeing people, unless it is directly related to our own national security,'' he said.\nEx-presidents weren't supposed to criticize sitting presidents. Adding insult to injury, Woodward himself was in the cathedral. How did he manage to get all these deathbed confessions, W. had to wonder. ''Jeez,'' his bubble read, ''does he have an interview with my old man in the can?''\nRummy's pop-up was as cocky as ever: ''Golly, I've been gone three weeks and things are really looking up in Iraq.''\nJames Baker's secret thoughts belied his poker face: ''I tried to help you out, son, but you're too dang stubborn. Or 'resolute,' as you say. Stubolute. A clear case of TMC -- too much Cheney.''\nDick Cheney's bubble was trouble: ''I'm surging, I'm surging, I'm surging.''\nOp-Ed Columnist
1816114	A Hanging And A Funeral	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CEFDC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Last Saturday was a strange day. It started with the hanging of Saddam Hussein. The more I read about the hasty, quasi-legal maneuvers used by Iraq's Shiite leaders to rush Saddam to the gallows on a Muslim holiday, Id al-Adha, and the more I watched the grainy cellphone video of the event, in which a guard is heard taunting Saddam with chants of ''Moktada! Moktada!'' -- the Shiite cleric whose death squads have killed hundreds of Sunnis -- and the more I read of the insults Saddam spat back, the more it resembled a tribal revenge ritual rather than the culmination of a constitutional process in which America should be proud to have participated.\nBassam al-Husseini, an aide to Iraq's Shiite prime minister, was quoted by the BBC as saying Saddam's execution was ''an Id gift to the Iraqi people.'' Many Sunnis would not share that view. For his part, Saddam, a Sunni, used his last breaths to spew vitriol against ''the traitors, the Americans, the spies and the Persians.'' For Persians, read Shiites.\nNo wonder the BBC's world affairs editor, John Simpson, reported from Baghdad: ''Altogether, the execution as we now see it is shown to be an ugly, degrading business, which is more reminiscent of a public hanging in the 18th century than a considered act of 21st-century official justice. Under Saddam Hussein, prisoners were regularly taunted and mistreated in their last hours. The most disturbing thing about the new video of Saddam's execution for crimes precisely like this is that it is all much too reminiscent of what used to happen here.''\nBut as I said, Saturday was a strange day. After watching Saddam's hanging in the morning, I was sitting at my computer late in the afternoon and suddenly heard the strains of ''My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty'' being played on the TV in the next room. When I checked what was going on, I saw President Ford's coffin being unloaded from Air Force One.\nI have to admit I got a lump in my throat watching that scene and listening to that stirring melody. Saddam's execution was a snapshot of a country divided. Gerald Ford's funeral was a snapshot of a country united -- political supporters and opponents alike paying tribute to a president, who was surrounded by an honor guard representing every color of the American rainbow and whose place in history was secured by an act of pardon and national healing.\nHow fortunate to live in a country where this is the political norm, built up over generations.\n''Because of our basic unity, we can afford to be divided on specific issues,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, author of ''The Case for Goliath.'' ''Democracy is about differences and contesting them in the public sphere, and it only works when there is basic agreement about the fundamentals. We should feel fortunate that we have a democratic history and set of beliefs. Those beliefs can be imported by those who want them and don't have them, but they can't be exported. We can only create a context where others would want to import them.''\nThe raw tribal theatrics of Saddam's hanging highlight just how few of these values Iraq has imported. We are to blame for not creating the security needed for those values to take hold. But not enough of our Iraqi allies have risen to the occasion, either. It was our closest Iraqi partners who oversaw Saddam's tribal hanging. We have to look that in the eye.\nSaddam deserved to die 100 deaths. But imagine if Iraq's Shiite leaders had surprised everyone, declared that there had been enough killing in Iraq and commuted Saddam's sentence to life in prison -- sparing his life in hopes of uniting the country rather than executing him and dividing it further. I don't know if it would have helped, but I do know Iraqis have rarely surprised us with gestures of reconciliation -- only with new ways to kill each other.\nNow President Bush wants a ''surge'' of more U.S. troops to Baghdad, in one last attempt to bring order. Whenever I hear this surge idea, I think of a couple who recently got married but the marriage was never very solid. Then one day they say to each other, ''Hey, let's have a baby, that will bring us together.'' It never works.\nIf the underlying union is not there, adding a baby won't help. And if the underlying willingness to share power and resources is not present among the major communities in Iraq, adding more U.S. troops won't help either. Adding more troops makes sense only if it's to buy more time for positive trends that have already begun to appear on the horizon. I don't see them.\nAs Saddam's hanging underscored, Iraqis are doing things their way. So maybe it's time to get out of their way.\nOp-Ed Columnist
1816115	This Is Your Brain on Drugs, Dad	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05EEDC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	WHEN releasing last week's Monitoring the Future survey on drug use, John P. Walters, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, boasted that ''broad'' declines in teenage drug use promise ''enormous beneficial consequences not only for our children now, but for the rest of their lives.'' Actually, anybody who has looked carefully at the report and other recent federal studies would see a dramatically different picture: skyrocketing illicit drug abuse and related deaths among teenagers and adults alike.\nWhile Monitoring the Future, an annual study that depends on teenagers to self-report on their behavior, showed that drug use dropped sharply in the last decade, the National Center for Health Statistics has reported that teenage deaths from illicit drug abuse have tripled over the same period. This reverses 25 years of declining overdose fatalities among youths, suggesting that teenagers are now joining older generations in increased drug use.\nWhat the Monitoring the Future report does have right is that teenagers remain the least part of America's burgeoning drug abuse crisis. Today, after 20 years, hundreds of billions of dollars, and millions of arrests and imprisonments in the war on drugs, America's rate of drug-related deaths, hospital emergencies, crime and social ills stand at record highs.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of Americans dying from the abuse of illegal drugs has leaped by 400 percent in the last two decades, reaching a record 28,000 in 2004. The F.B.I. reported that drug arrests reached an all-time high of 1.8 million in 2005. The Drug Abuse Warning Network, a federal agency that compiles statistics on hospital emergency cases caused by illicit drug abuse, says that number rose to 940,000 in 2004 -- a huge increase over the last quarter century.\nWhy are so few Americans aware of these troubling trends? One reason is that today's drug abusers are simply the ''wrong'' group. As David Musto, a psychiatry professor at Yale and historian of drug abuse, points out, wars on drugs have traditionally depended on ''linkage between a drug and a feared or rejected group within society.'' Today, however, the fastest-growing population of drug abusers is white, middle-aged Americans. This is a powerful mainstream constituency, and unlike with teenagers or urban minorities, it is hard for the government or the news media to present these drug users as a grave threat to the nation.\nAmong Americans in their 40s and 50s, deaths from illicit-drug overdoses have risen by 800 percent since 1980, including 300 percent in the last decade. In 2004, American hospital emergency rooms treated 400,000 patients between the ages 35 and 64 for abusing heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana, hallucinogens and ''club drugs'' like ecstasy.\nEqually surprising, graying baby boomers have become America's fastest-growing crime scourge. The F.B.I. reports that last year the number of Americans over the age of 40 arrested for violent and property felonies rose to 420,000, up from 170,000 in 1980. Arrests for drug offenses among those over 40 rose to 360,000 last year, up from 22,000 in 1980. The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 440,000 Americans ages 40 and older were incarcerated in 2005, triple the number in 1990.\nYet drug officials seem fixated on paper-and-pencil surveys of drug use by teens. In releasing its survey last week, the Office of Drug Control Policy trumpeted that ''America's balanced strategy to reduce drug use is working.'' Representative Mark Souder, an Indiana Republican who has been a top supporter of federal antidrug efforts, says ''the Bush administration is doing very well'' on this front because ''drug use, particularly among young people, is down.''\nBut, some may say, don't teenage drug use rates predict future drug problems? To the contrary: 30 years of experience shows that fluctuations in the percentage of youths who report using drugs on surveys has almost nothing to do with the harm that drug abuse causes (addiction, disease, injury, death, crime, family and community distress), either in adolescence or later in life.\nI compared teenage drug use trends reported annually by Monitoring the Future since the 1970s with trends for other behaviors and with federal crime, health and education statistics. In years in which a higher percentage of high school seniors told the survey takers they used illicit drugs, teenagers consistently reported and experienced lower rates of crime, murder, drug-related hospital emergencies and deaths, suicides, H.I.V. infection, school dropouts, delinquency, pregnancy, violence, theft in and outside of school, and fights with parents, employers and teachers.\nThe data also contradict Mr. Walters's claim that generations reporting lower rates of drug use enjoy ''less addiction, less suffering, less crime, lower health costs and higher achievement.'' For example, baby boomers rarely used illegal drugs as youths.\nIn 1972, the University of Michigan researchers who carry out Monitoring the Future found that just 22 percent of high school seniors had ever used illegal drugs, compared to 48 percent of the class of 2005. Yet as that generation has aged, it has been afflicted by drug abuse and its related ills -- overdoses, hospitalizations, drug-related crime -- at far higher rates than those experienced by later generations at the same ages.\nIt's time to end the obsession with hyping teenage drug use. The meaningless surveys that policy makers now rely on should be replaced with a comprehensive ''drug abuse index'' that pulls together largely ignored data on drug-related deaths, hospital emergencies, crime, diseases and similar practical measures.\nA good model is the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs' fledgling drug abuse index, which I helped compile and which aims to pinpoint which populations and areas are most harmed by drugs, both legal and illicit.\nFew experts would have suspected that the biggest contributors to California's drug abuse, death and injury toll are educated, middle-aged women living in the Central Valley and rural areas, while the fastest-declining, lowest-risk populations are urban black and Latino teenagers. Yet the index found exactly that. These are the sorts of trends we need to understand if we are to design effective policies.\nThe United States' drug abuse crisis has exploded out of control. Scientifically designed strategies are urgently needed to target the manifest drug-caused damage that current policies are failing miserably to address.\nOp-Ed Contributor Mike Males is a senior researcher at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice.
1816116	Enron's Last Victim: American Markets	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EEDC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	WHEN the new Congress begins its session tomorrow, two familiar faces will not be present: Senator Paul S. Sarbanes and Representative Michael G. Oxley, who are both retiring. Mr. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, has served for 30 years; Mr. Oxley, an Ohio Republican, for 26 -- and their main legacy will be their joint attack on corporate corruption, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe act, which was passed hastily in the wake of the Enron scandal, was surely well intentioned. But it has proven counterproductive in the extreme, and Congress would best honor the departing lawmakers by repealing it.\nSarbanes-Oxley has seriously harmed American corporations and financial markets without increasing investor confidence. The section of the law requiring companies to perform internal audits has turned out to be far more costly than proponents projected, especially for smaller firms. These costs have led some small companies to go private, hardly a victory for public oversight, and some foreign firms to withdraw their stocks from American exchanges.\nIn addition, the average ''listing premium'' -- the benefit that companies receive by listing their stocks on American exchanges -- has declined by 19 percentage points since 2002. This explains why the percentage of worldwide initial public offerings on our exchanges dropped to 5 percent last year, from 50 percent in 2000.\nOther costs associated with the act may turn out to be more important. For example, more stringent financial regulations and increased penalties for accounting errors may make senior managers too risk-averse. Most chief executives are not accountants, so the requirement that they personally affirm tax reports -- at the risk of jail time should anything be amiss -- may make them reluctant to partake in perfectly legitimate activities.\nParadoxically, Sarbanes-Oxley's strict rules on oversight by boards of directors would have been insufficient to prevent the collapse of Enron. By the act's standards, Enron had a model board; most members were distinguished professionals. The chairman of the audit committee was a former accounting professor and dean of the Stanford Business School.\nNor would the act's provisions to create a stronger Securities and Exchange Commission have made a difference. The commission had been aware of Enron's accounting techniques since 1992 and had never thought to question them.\nNor was Sarbanes-Oxley necessary in prosecuting the senior managers of Enron, WorldCom and other corporations where fraud was committed -- all have been convicted of accounting fraud under laws predating the act.\nThe negative repercussions of the act on businesses might have been worth it if the act had achieved its primary goal: substantially increasing the confidence of investors in the accuracy of the accounts of firms listed on the exchanges. But that does not seem to have happened.\nThe best measure of investor confidence is the price-earnings ratio -- the price that investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's reported earnings. The overall price-earnings ratio for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, however, has declined continuously since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was being drafted in the spring of 2002.\nSeveral leaders of the new Democratic Congressional majority have endorsed a relaxation of the audit requirements and other parts of the act. That is encouraging, but it is not enough. The basic structure of Sarbanes-Oxley is unsound.\nOne big problem is that the act nationalized the rules for corporate governance, reducing the value of the competition among the states for setting such rules. In addition, the act failed to resolve the major conflict of interest created when auditing firms are paid by the companies they audit. Rather than creating a regulation to change the system, Sarbanes-Oxley created an expensive and arguably unconstitutional new regulatory agency to regulate the audit firms' activities.\nAnd, as is too often the case, Congress has rewarded the failures of the very bureaucracies that failed to keep up with Enron -- doubling the budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTinkering is not enough. Sarbanes-Oxley continues to discourage smaller companies from trading publicly and foreign companies from listing their stocks on American exchanges. In the eyes of investors, it hasn't cleaned up any corruption, it has only forced companies to jump through hoops. As Senator Sarbanes and Representative Oxley drift into retirement, their act should retire with them.\nOp-Ed Contributor William A. Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute, was acting chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan.

1816118	A Brooklyn Furrier and Artist Finds Soul Mates Among the Indians of the West	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDC1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Even in a city full of talented people with eclectic interests, Irving Feller's combination of work and obsession stands out. Mr. Feller is a furrier by trade and an abstract artist out of love.\nHe can make a sumptuous fur coat from scratch as easily as he can create jarring works of pattern and color. And both pursuits are informed by his passion for American Indian culture. All this has transformed his family's fur business, started in 1916 by his father, into an unexpected preserve of one man's vision.\nAmong the furs, paired with Mardi Gras beads draping the window's mannequin to celebrate the new year, are a trove of artifacts: turquoise rings, a feathered headdress labeled ''Child's War Bonnet'' and hand-sewn baby moccasins.\n''Come on in,'' Mr. Feller, 78, calls out, welcoming a visitor to the Manhattan Furrier at 685 Manhattan Avenue, a bustling street in the once Polish and now hipster enclave of Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Two deer heads with gentle eyes and velveteen antlers hang above the entrance. From the ceiling and walls hang hundreds of pelts, mink stoles, sables and sheared beaver, to name a few.\nUnderneath a chandelier of raccoon tails, Mr. Feller's wife, Selma, is wrapped in a parka, her chair resting on a bull skin. Fanning her long fingers, she shrugged, ''I could have any fur I want.''\nIn one corner is a painting of a clown, sketched in blue pencil from Mr. Feller's figurative period. There are many canvases riddled with an intricate black and white geometric maze drawn in Magic Marker, Mr. Feller's favorite medium.\n''I was drawing the human face for a long time,'' he said. ''Somehow, these forms mean more to me now than the face.''\nMr. Feller's store is a work of art. Years ago, he spray-painted the walls gold, which, depending on one's viewpoint, looks like fur or an abstract design. Also hanging on the walls are the Ten Commandments and yellowed news clippings of Mr. Feller wearing a headdress on a visit to a reservation. A chart of Indian chiefs identifies them by name in Polish. It is hung opposite a poster once issued by McDonald's depicting the faces of black history.\n''I am already an old man and we are going to live a certain amount of time,'' Mr. Feller said. ''Human nature is we're animals. I'll come out and tell you just what I'm thinking.''\nIn his dim workshop, his blackened sewing machines rest, awaiting a big beaver coat for a Botero-proportioned customer. A huge portrait of Selma hangs over his worktable.\nMr. Feller was born and raised in Astoria, Queens, where his father had immigrated at 14 from Ukraine in the early 1900s and later started a fur business. Mr. Feller's grandfather had immigrated from Ukraine after abandoning Mr. Feller's father and his grandmother, who ran a small candy stand. ''My father became a terrific furrier, nailing, cutting, matching, operating,'' Mr. Feller said.\nIn World War II, Mr. Feller served as an artist for the Army, creating original silk-screened posters that described treatments for syphilis and gonorrhea. One poster showed a woman lifting her skirt, reading, ''Is it worth it?''\nAfter the war, he said, the government paid for art studies at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Then he went to Jerusalem, where he worked as a portraitist in the King David Citadel Hotel. When he returned home, Mr. Feller took up the family business.\nRelating his life history like a fable, he told of one key event after another. ''I went to the Catskills, telling the bus driver to take me to the Borscht Belt's highest mountain. There I found my Selma.''\nSelma, 81, grew up on the Lower East Side, the daughter of a Polish father and Austrian mother. The Fellers have a daughter, a teacher at Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan.\nIn the back of Mr. Feller's store is an huge safe filled with fragrant furs. ''But I see myself as an artist first,'' he said.\nThirty-five years ago Mr. Feller was sitting at his desk, drawing one of his colorful abstract patterns, when the phone rang. The voice on the other end introduced himself as Bill Christensen of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. ''He said: 'We'd like you to help the Indians go into the fur business. I'm sending you a ticket to fly out to Fort Hall, Idaho,' '' Mr. Feller recalled.\nNo ticket arrived. Mr. Feller called Mr. Christensen but was told that the bureau had run out of money. ''I already told Selma, 'I'm going to the Native Americans, they need me,' '' he said. ''I'd never been west of the Hudson, but I was blessed with a little blue Chevy.''\nMr. Feller drove hundreds of miles along the Canadian border and wound up near Bonner's Ferry, Idaho. ''They'll kill you, they have wild dogs, they'll bury you on the reservation, I was warned,'' he said. ''Finally, I saw little houses in a circle. The chief was a woman, and the dogs came out and licked my hands.''\nEvery year Mr. Feller visits the Kutenai tribe and the Shoshone-Bannock in southern Idaho, the Crow and the Nez Perce in Montana and Wyoming and the Apache, Navajo, Zuni and Hopi in Arizona and New Mexico. He sells them skins from animals they no longer trap and he buys jewelry from them to sell in his Greenpoint shop.\nMr. Feller compared many American Indians on reservations to the concentration camp victims he met in Paris after the war. Many were removed from their original sites, and their way of life was nearly destroyed. But in them Mr. Feller discovered what he calls ''honor'' and artistic vision.\n''They use their eyes,'' he said. ''Be quiet. The less you say the better.'' As if to wrap things up about his relationship with the Indians and his view of his own life, he added: ''The underdog. Always go for the underdog.''\nGREENPOINT JOURNAL
1816119	McGreevey Finds Way Back to the State House, on Canvas	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E7DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	The last time James E. McGreevey was inside the governor's office, his name was painted on the glass door.\nBut early Tuesday, when most employees were beginning to trickle into the Capitol from the New Year's Day holiday, Mr. McGreevey had already arrived -- his first visit since his resignation in November 2004 -- for a ceremony to mark his legacy in another way: with the hanging of his official portrait.\nThe unveiling, which was unannounced and closed to the public, was less a ceremony than it was a private gathering of Mr. McGreevey, his parents, a couple of former aides, his partner, Mark O'Donnell, and Gov. Jon S. Corzine. It was a far more muted affair than the release of the ex-governor's book, ''The Confession,'' in September, when he appeared on ''Oprah,'' ''Larry King Live'' and at numerous book signings.\nThe portrait, by the artist Chen Yanning, now hangs on the far wall of the governor's outer office, along with about a half-dozen others. This is the same room where Mr. McGreevey announced that he was resigning because, he said, he had had an extramarital affair with a man.\nDespite the circumstances surrounding his departure and his uneven legacy as the state's chief executive, Mr. McGreevey refused to view his return to the office he once held as bittersweet.\n''It was pleasant,'' Mr. McGreevey said in a telephone interview hours after his visit. ''It was just nice to see all of the good people who continue to work in government even though I've moved to another chapter.''\nDuring the brief appearance, Governor Corzine spoke briefly with Mr. McGreevey and his father, Jack, a former Marine drill sergeant; Mr. Corzine is a veteran of the Marine Reserves.\n''Governor Corzine was extremely gracious to my parents, which meant a great deal to me,'' Mr. McGreevey said. ''Jon is always kind. He and my dad discussed the Marine Corps.''\nThe portrait depicts Mr. McGreevey seated on the edge of a desk, wearing a dark suit and a red tie. His right hand rests on a book of New Jersey laws; he is framed by a window that opens onto a green lawn and flanked by the New Jersey and United States flags.\n''The artist was very kind,'' Mr. McGreevey said jokingly. ''Most importantly, my mother liked it.''\nThe hanging of the portrait, which was completed in August 2005, had been expected as long ago as December 2005. But an agreement over how to handle the unveiling was elusive.\nSome in the State House questioned whether the timing of the unveiling -- a private ceremony after a long holiday weekend -- was meant to circumvent awkward questions about Mr. McGreevey's tenure.\nThrough a spokesman, Mr. Corzine said that there was no subtext to the scheduling.\n''We were looking for a mutually agreeable time,'' said the spokesman, Anthony Coley.\nFor his part, Mr. McGreevey said that there were more practical concerns.\n''We did the morning so Mark could make the train for New York,'' he said.
1816120	Giving Minority Students A Push Along the Path To Leadership Roles	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E7DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	On a recent cold Saturday, when most children around the city were relaxing after a week at school, 320 boys and girls, ages 10 to 13, filed into Nightingale-Bamford, a private girls' school in a stately brick building on the Upper East Side.\nThe children, most black or Hispanic, were going to be interviewed for a shot at admission to a private day or boarding school, or an elite suburban public school, through A Better Chance, a nonprofit group. The boys wore jackets and neckties. The girls were in prim skirts or nicely pressed trousers. Some were confident, but many were nervous, folding and unfolding their hands, sitting up extra straight as they waited to be interviewed. The stakes, after all, were high.\nThe program's mission is to increase the number of minority men and women in leadership positions. It is really about social mobility, whisking children out of their environment in urban neighborhoods and transporting them to institutions that are incubators for presidents, senators and titans of industry -- like Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., President Bush's alma mater.\n''These schools are pathways to influence and power in our society,'' said Sandra Simmons, the president of the group, pointing out that Governor-elect Deval L. Patrick of Massachusetts, the state's first black governor, is an alumnus of the program.\nYet A Better Chance and similar programs, like the New York City-based Prep for Prep, can only hope to provide mobility for the few. Most of the children who seek placement will never get a spot. In 2006, for example, 2,153 students nationwide applied to A Better Chance; about half passed the screening process, but only 624 children were accepted and 455 enrolled. The others declined their spots, largely for financial reasons, group officials said.\nThe former president of the group, Judith Berry Griffin, worried so much about talented students who had been rejected that she left the organization in 2003 and established a new nonprofit group, Pathways to College, to help them.\nTHE fact, she said, is that most public middle schools serving urban youth simply are not preparing children for academically challenging high schools, public or private. Even if they were, there are not many seats available in the elite private schools, or enough scholarship money to support the students who need financial aid, she said.\n''There are just not enough places,'' she said in a telephone interview from her office in Englewood, N.J. ''It's like musical chairs. We simply have to come to grips with the fact that we are throwing away hundreds of thousands of talented children. We don't even know what talent we are throwing away.''\nRather than helping a few students get coveted spots in a few schools, she now tries to help children in low-performing public high schools, like Barringer in Newark, get the skills they need to attend college by offering after-school writing courses and college guidance. ''My real goal is to bring about systemic change in the public schools,'' she said.\nMs. Simmons acknowledged the limitations of her program in being able to help only a small number of children. But, she said, it still has great impact because it vaults talented students of color to the highest echelons of society.\nAt the Nightingale-Bamford school, Kirk Cohall, 10, waited for his interview with his sister, Shannon, 14, and their parents. Their mother, Sophia, left her job as a financial analyst to spend more time with the family; their father, Kirkpatrick, is the senior minister at the Lenox Road Baptist Church in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Shannon, who was accepted as A Better Chance scholar last year, is a ninth grader at Poly Prep Country Day School, a mostly white school in Bay Ridge. Kirk, a fifth grader in a gifted program at Public School 279, a mostly black school in Canarsie, is hoping to join his sister there.\nKirk and Shannon's parents say the quality of public schools in Canarsie has declined in recent years as the neighborhood changed from mostly white to mostly black. P.S. 279 still posts high test scores, but it is badly overcrowded. Some children attend classes in an annex a few blocks away, and some classes are as large as 32 pupils. Several years ago, the school had a leaky roof and moldy classroom walls.\nDavid Cantor, a spokesman for the city's Department of Education, said overcrowding and adequate maintenance were issues citywide, acknowledging that some classes at P.S. 279 have 32 students.\nPoly Prep has a 25-acre campus, protected by a gate. It has a whole building dedicated to the study of science; one floor has physics labs, another has chemistry labs, and two floors have biology labs. The school has a professional-looking theater for student productions. It even has a pond with ducks -- 262 by one count.\n''You can sit around the pond and do your homework,'' Shannon said. ''It doesn't look like you're in Brooklyn. There's grass and trees. It's getting a breath of fresh air in the middle of the city.'' But what struck her most is the class size. ''There are 10 students in the class and you get lots of individual attention.''\nShannon was also accepted at Bronx High School of Science, but declined the spot because, her parents said, it was too far from home, and, with classes of 34 students, too crowded. Her parents pay part of Poly Prep's $27,000 a year tuition, and a scholarship from the school pays the rest.\nShannon's father, who has a Ph.D. in education from Fordham University, said graduates of A Better Chance can be agents for change. ''We want a better life for our children, of course,'' he said. But, he added, ''We're teaching them, whatever God wants you to do, you take it to help others.''\nMrs. Cohall, who attended public schools in Brooklyn, said she had always been a proponent of public education, but was worried about the quality of most public schools in black neighborhoods. ''The expectations are low and the resources are limited,'' she said.\n''If the playing field were level, we wouldn't need this program,'' she continued, referring to A Better Chance.\n''I think these kids are going to help to level it,'' Shannon's father added.\nON EDUCATION Clara Hemphill, a guest columnist, is author of ''New York City's Best Public High Schools.'' Samuel G. Freedman is on vacation.\nCorrection: January 4, 2007, Thursday The On Education column yesterday, about A Better Chance, a nonprofit group that helps minority children apply to private day and boarding high schools, misstated the surname of the president of the group and omitted her middle initial. She is Sandra E. Timmons, not Simmons.

1816123	As Costs of Wildfires Grow, So Does a Question: Who Should Pay?	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E6DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	The steeply rising cost of preventing and suppressing wildfires, which burned more of the American landscape in 2006 than in any other year since at least 1960, is creating a rift between Washington and state and local governments over how the burden ought to be shouldered.\nA study issued in November by the inspector general's office of the United States Department of Agriculture, the parent agency of the Forest Service, said the nature of the wildfire threat was changing as private homes and communities pushed ever closer to the boundaries of once-remote public lands. Those communities and landowners, rather than federal taxpayers, should have to pay for more of their own fire protection, the report concluded.\nStates and local governments are gearing up to fight back in Congress, arguing that decades of federal mismanagement of national forests and open spaces, not development, created the threat and that little communities with few resources are neither responsible for it nor equipped to make a difference.\nThe pattern of wildfire distribution during the recently ended fire season, which charred more than 9.8 million acres, supports either side. According to federal statistics, more state, county and private lands burned than in any other year since 1997 -- about half the total 2006 losses -- primarily because of monstrous blazes in Oklahoma, in Texas and across the Upper Plains, regions where most property is privately owned.\nThat finding, though also driven by broader factors like drought and heat that have little to do with residential development in fire-prone areas, supports the federal contention that the government has had to shift an increasingly large share of its resources from the task of protecting its own forests to firefighting elsewhere.\nIn some places, though, the issue is more complex. In Stillwater County, Mont., north of Yellowstone National Park, for example, the small, long-established towns of Nye and Fishtail are bordered on two sides by national forest. In early July, the first of two huge fires erupted in the forest and roared into those communities, where 100,000 acres of mostly private land and 32 homes were burned. The blaze was the worst in the county's history, local officials say.\n''The forest is very dry and primed for fires started by lightning, and when that occurs in a forest not managed as well as it could have been, it soon gets out of control and meets the community,'' said Ken Mesch, the Stillwater County disaster and emergency services coordinator. ''If the federal government started pulling back money for fire suppression, they would be hanging us out to dry.''\nFederal land managers say protection of private land at the boundaries of public space -- called the wildland-urban interface -- is the fastest-growing component of the nation's firefighting budget. In 2003 and 2004, the inspector general's report estimated, the Forest Service spent at least half a billion dollars, and perhaps as much as a billion, protecting private property in such areas.\nThe trend is similar at the Interior Department, which oversees hundreds of millions of acres of public lands in the West through the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service. Fire prevention activities -- controlled fires or thinning of burnable vegetation -- have shifted there toward the interface lands, said Lynn Scarlett, deputy interior secretary.\nMs. Scarlett said that almost half the 1.1 million acres treated by the Interior Department for fire-risk reduction in 2006 were in interface zones, about double the proportion as recently as 2002. She said her department, too, was considering that it demand increased cost-sharing by state and local governments, though she emphasized that any outcome would have to be collaborative.\n''One of the last things you want in an emergency is people squabbling over who's going to pay,'' she said.\nThe report from the Agriculture Department's inspector general said a major problem was simply the weight of accumulated assumptions: fire response in the West has long meant federal authorities' riding to the rescue, with no questions asked and no cost too great to bear.\n''Public expectations and uncertainties about protection responsibilities,'' the report said, ''compel the Forest Service to suppress fires aggressively and at great expense when private property is at risk, even when fires pose little threat to National Forest system land.''\nAbout 8.5 million homes were built at the wildland-urban interface within the interior West in the 1990s alone, according to the Forest Service. But state and local officials say they already pay their share to protect those communities and homeowners, partly because the residential growth has coincided with years of federal budget cuts. Arizona, for instance, now has 12 to 14 air tanker firefighting aircraft under contract, up from 2 to 4 in 2005, as a result of reduced federal spending on tankers, said Lori Faeth, a policy adviser to Gov. Janet Napolitano.\n''Our forests are in the condition they are because of poor federal management,'' Ms. Faeth said. ''They've put us in this position, and they have the responsibility to pay for it.''\nThe Forest Service's director of fire and aviation management, Tom Harbour, said the agency would follow up on the inspector general's recommendations. ''We're not going to walk away,'' Mr. Harbour said, ''but we will engage in a vigorous debate with our partners about the right way to split the pie.''\nStill, money is only part of the issue, he said. Communities and developers in the West should be thinking in new ways as well, he said, including the use of fire-wise construction techniques and preparedness plans that involve residents in their own defense even before fires start.\nMany land experts say hardly anyone is addressing the most tangled and emotional question raised by the debate: how much or how little voice federal land managers should have in land-use decisions.\n''Thinking through in advance the fire implications of a new subdivision next to a national forest boundary -- that doesn't happen,'' said James L. Caswell, administrator of the Idaho Office of Species Conservation.\nGiven the property rights issue and the tension between local governments and Washington that has shaped the West's culture for the last century, a system of planning that allows federal officials veto power would seem unlikely.\nMr. Caswell said better planning must be part of the solution. ''A thousand houses next to a boundary could overwhelm all the other cost-control issues,'' he said.\n''But,'' he added, ''that's a very emotional topic, so it's really hard to deal with.''
1816124	Same-Sex Marriage Vote Advances in Massachusetts	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E6DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Massachusetts, the only state where same-sex marriage is legal, took a first step toward possibly banning it Tuesday when legislators voted to advance a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union between a man and a woman.\nThe amendment now requires the approval of at least 50 legislators in another vote in the 2007-8 session. Then it would be placed on the November 2008 ballot as a referendum question.\nIf it passed, the amendment would not invalidate the more than 8,000 same-sex marriages that have taken place since they became legal in May 2004. But it would prevent future marriages of gay men and lesbians.\n''This is democracy in action,'' said Kris Mineau, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, which sponsored the amendment. ''It's giving people the opportunity to vote on the most essential institution in human existence -- marriage.''\nArline Isaacson, co-chairwoman of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, choked back tears.\n''The price that our children and families will pay is so severe that we simply have to recommit ourselves to fight this some more,'' she said.\nThe swiftness of the vote on Tuesday surprised people on both sides of the issue, taking place without any debate, just minutes after the constitutional convention had been gaveled into session. Proponents of the amendment needed just 50 of the legislature's 200 lawmakers to support it; the final vote was 61 in favor of the amendment and 132 opposed.\nLater in the day, supporters of same-sex marriage persuaded lawmakers to reconsider the amendment, but the second vote, 62 to 134, only affirmed the results of the first.\nNational groups on both sides of the issue said they would commit resources to help advocates wage battle here. This past Election Day, the tide had seemed to be turning slightly in favor of supporters of same-sex marriage, with the defeat of an opposition amendment in Arizona and passage of seven others by slimmer margins than similar amendments in 2004.\nJust two months ago, at an earlier constitutional convention, the legislature appeared to have essentially killed the proposal to allow a vote. During that session, legislators recessed without voting on the amendment, tabling it until Jan. 2, the last day of the legislative session. Both sides said they expected that lawmakers would then vote to end the session without taking up the measure.\nBut last week, the state's Supreme Judicial Court, which three years ago ruled that same-sex marriage should be legal, threw a wrench into things.\nThe court chided lawmakers for their maneuvers to avoid a vote on the amendment, saying the legislature had demonstrated ''indifference to, or defiance of, its constitutional duties.''\nThe court said it was not empowered to order the legislature to vote on the amendment, which petitioners, including Gov. Mitt Romney, had asked it to do. But the court's criticism appeared to be enough to make some lawmakers, including some supporters of same-sex marriage, decide to allow a vote.\n''Certainly, the court ruling changed the atmosphere this week,'' said Mr. Mineau, whose organization had gathered a record 170,000 petition signatures to get the amendment before the legislature.\nMs. Isaacson said, ''The S.J.C. decision really tipped the scales against us.''\nTuesday's vote was considered a victory for Governor Romney, a Republican who has used his opposition to same-sex marriage as a conservative rallying point as he has laid the groundwork for an expected run for the presidency in 2008.\nIn a statement Tuesday, Mr. Romney called the marriage vote ''a huge victory for the people of Massachusetts.''\nBy contrast, the vote was something of a rebuke to the incoming governor, Deval L. Patrick, a supporter of same-sex marriage who on Thursday will be sworn in as the first Democrat to occupy the governor's office in 16 years. On Tuesday, before the constitutional convention, Mr. Patrick met with the House speaker and the Senate president, both Democrats, to urge them to find a way to defeat the amendment, even if it meant adjourning without voting on it.\n''I believe that adults should be free to choose whom they wish to love and to marry,'' Mr. Patrick said, adding that he objected to using the constitutional amendment process ''to give a minority fewer freedoms than the majority.''\nAfter the vote, Mr. Patrick said in a statement, ''We have work to do over the next year to turn this around.''\nThe new legislature taking office this month includes more supporters of same-sex marriage. But people on both sides of the issue said it was not clear if the balance had tipped enough to sideline the amendment.\nMs. Isaacson and other gay rights activists have said that, should the initiative get on the 2008 ballot, they fear losing to an expensive campaign that would draw opponents from around the country. Polls in Massachusetts have generally found that just over half of the citizens surveyed supported same-sex marriage, but about the same number wanted the constitutional amendment to come before voters.\nOn Tuesday, scores of demonstrators lined the street outside the Statehouse and spilled into the building.\n''I think it is going to get defeated next time around,'' said Lea Roy, 38, a supporter of same-sex marriage from Fitchburg who hopes to marry her girlfriend. ''It's something you always dream about growing up -- getting married. Then it's like, I'm gay and we're not allowed to get married.''\nBut David Wilson, who, along with his partner, Rob Compton, was a plaintiff in the original lawsuit that legalized same-sex marriage, was less optimistic.\n''It feels like the rug has been pulled out from under us,'' said Mr. Wilson, who has married Mr. Compton. ''Maybe I'll feel better tomorrow, but today I feel like I've been shot.''\nBea Martins, 63, an opponent of same-sex marriage from Fall River, said she was ''very pleased'' by the vote. As the initiative winds its way through the rest of the process, Ms. Martins said, ''my counsel is we continue praying to the dear Lord for justice to be done.''
1816125	Two Governors Brace for a Showdown Over How Deep a River Should Run	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E6DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Delaware River, which separates New Jersey and Pennsylvania, is putting distance between the Democratic governors of the two states, who are at a standoff over the financing and environmental implications of a plan to deepen the river for larger cargo ships and oil tankers.\nAfter a yearlong impasse over the $300 million project, which requires approval and money from both states, Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania has halted the work of the Delaware River Port Authority, a bistate agency he heads that regulates activity along the river, blocking construction projects and increasing debt. He warned at a recent news conference that ''our patience is running out.''\nBut Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey said that officials in his state are not yet convinced that Pennsylvania's recent promises to accept the bulk of the waste from the riverbed and cover any cost overruns would allay their concerns. Moreover, Mr. Corzine, who has yet to offer a definitive position on the project, has expressed doubts about it from an environmental standpoint.\n''I understand his frustration,'' Mr. Corzine said in an interview. ''We have people who are frustrated also about the environment, and I'm certain with all the details, some of the conceptual ideas that have been framed, we'll work through it.''\nThe debate over the Delaware predates both governors, and for many of those who have followed it -- environmentalists and developers alike -- the stakes are high.\nBackers say the proposal to deepen more than 100 miles of the river, from the mouth of Delaware Bay north to Philadelphia, to 45 feet from 40 feet, is critical to the revitalization of the Port of Philadelphia. Critics contend the dredging could shake free contaminated sediments that could be absorbed by fish or make their way into the water supply.\n''It's a giant waste of money that's going to hurt the environment and waste taxpayers' resources,'' said Jeff Tittel, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club.\nMr. Tittel challenged Mr. Rendell's contention that the dredging would make the Philadelphia port more competitive with other major East Coast ports. ''The port will still be 100 miles from the ocean,'' Mr. Tittel pointed out, ''and will still not be competitive with Port of Newark, Norfolk, or even Halifax.''\nGovernor Rendell continues to push for the project as a potential economic development engine. He pointed to a similar, if more costly, dredging project effectively undertaken at the Port of New York in the last six years, asking in a recent interview, ''Why is it good enough in the north and not good enough in the south?''\nMeanwhile, his refusal to take action to reduce the interest rates on bonds issued by the Delaware River Port Authority has increased the agency's debt by $7 million.\nIn addition to agreeing to handle waste and extra costs, Governor Rendell has also promised to appoint a committee to examine the environmental impact of the 10-year project. But Governor Corzine dismissed these concessions, saying, ''It would be an overreading of that to say we've come to an agreement.''\nThose who know both men and understand the dispute said that they are dismayed that the governors of neighboring states, both from the same political party, have been unable to have a meeting of the minds.\n''Hopefully, the two governors will sit down and resolve this,'' said State Senator Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat from Gloucester County in southern New Jersey and an opponent of the plan. ''Honestly, I haven't heard anything about this in a year.''\nMr. Rendell and Mr. Corzine, who have both played roles in the national Democratic Party, have enjoyed a cordial if not particularly deep friendship. But their styles are as different as the environs of the well-heeled New Jersey suburb of Summit, where Mr. Corzine lived while he was chief executive at Goldman Sachs, and the rough-and-tumble, in-your-face attitude of South Philadelphia, in Mr. Rendell's adopted hometown.\nThe garrulous Mr. Rendell, who will be 63 this week, is a former prosecutor and Philadelphia mayor who once instigated spectators to throw snowballs on the field at a pro football game. The earnest Mr. Corzine, who just turned 60, is a multimillionaire and former Wall Street trader who successfully tackled fiscal problems in his first year but sometimes struggled to get along with state legislative leaders from his own party.\nDespite his frustration, Governor Rendell said the issue has not affected his friendship with Mr. Corzine, a relationship that he said dates to his successful 1991 campaign for mayor of Philadelphia, when Mr. Corzine, then a trader at Goldman Sachs, was a significant campaign contributor.\n''I think he's a great, great, great public servant,'' said Mr. Rendell, a native New Yorker, who before becoming governor in 2003 served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ''I believe that Governor Corzine has acted in good faith and does intend to resolve this.''\nMr. Corzine, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, declined to discuss how the dispute had affected his rapport with Mr. Rendell. Indeed, he was reluctant to talk about the matter.\nDays after Mr. Rendell's acerbic comment that New Jersey officials are ''running out of excuses,'' Mr. Corzine would say only, ''I actually think it's better for us to have private conversations about it.''\nMr. Rendell said that he has tried to be accommodating with New Jersey officials, who over the past 14 months had asked to delay talks on the dredging project while political campaigns were going on in both states. Also, Mr. Corzine was trying to work out the details of his first budget, which led to a seven-day shutdown in July of the state government. He said that he and Mr. Corzine were scheduled to meet this month on the issue.\n''I don't know what reason they'll find now,'' Mr. Rendell said of the prospect of any future delays.\nDavid P. Rebovich, director of the Institute of New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said the showdown has highlighted Mr. Rendell's ''feisty, quick-witted, can-do style'' and the fact that Mr. Corzine is ''much more thoughtful and deliberative.''\n''The impasse isn't doing either state much good,'' Professor Rebovich added.
1816126	For Some Moviegoers, It's 'Hooray for Bollywood'	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E6DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Swollen ticket lines, shouting children, tempers rising as the movies sold out: This was any suburban multiplex during the holidays.\nBut different.\nVada pav sandwiches and mango kulfi were sold at the concession stand. Conversations were in Gujarati or Hindi. A poster in the lobby advertised an action film starring Aishwarya Rai on one of six screens showing Indian cinema.\n''It reminds me of home,'' said Ambika Sikka, 26, who had come with her husband to see ''Bhagam Bhag,'' a movie about a theater troupe that travels from India to London. (Plot: Harassed actress quits troupe. Actors search for new heroine in London. Accidentally steal heroin from gangsters. Mystery and hilarity follow.)\nThe Columbia Park Cinema 12 sits at one end of a gloomy underground parking lot at a shopping mall just off the approach to the Lincoln Tunnel. Half of its 12 screens, called CinePlaza, are permanently reserved for Indian films, making it the largest such complex on the East Coast, according to its operator, Vijay Shah.\nOn Wednesday nights, when the tickets are half price, the 12-plex is crammed with customers eager to see the latest hits from Bollywood, India's Bombay-based, Hindi-language movie industry, or other regional Indian cinema.\nFor the mostly Indian audience that comes to this transformed suburban theater, a trip to the movies is still an outing, at once a family affair, a reminder of home and a chance to experience a beloved cinematic tradition.\n''The Indian movie theaters are like community centers,'' said Suketu Mehta of Brooklyn, who wrote ''Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found,'' and has attended the CinePlaza with his parents. ''It's a very cheap round trip home.''\nBut these days Mr. Shah's business, one of the most successful Bollywood movie houses in the country, is being threatened.\nTwo weeks ago, the owner of the mall, Forest City Ratner Companies, won approval to redevelop the section where the CinePlaza is situated, perhaps into a residential tower, according to township officials.\n''I'm not sure what I'm going to do,'' said Mr. Shah, an engineer who entered the cinema business several years ago, and has already changed location once.\nHe said he had already started looking for another space to rent. ''I knew that sooner or later this was going to happen,'' he said.\nIndian cinemas have sprung up across the country, signaling both the growth of the South Asian population and the increasing popularity of films from the subcontinent. Last year, Hindi-language films, many of them made in what is now called Mumbai, had by far their most successful year in the United States, with, among others, 8 of the 15 highest-grossing foreign-language films, said Gitesh Pandya, the editor of the Web site boxofficeguru.com.\nThere were 228,000 Asian Indians living in New Jersey in 2005, according to the Census Bureau, and the number living in New York City is about the same.\n''For South Asians afflicted by homesickness like I was, it was a wonderful place where other people were in love with these crazy movies like you were,'' said Mr. Mehta, who as a teenager watched Indian movies on Queens Boulevard after his family moved to Jackson Heights from India.\nWhen videotapes of the movies became easier to find, some theaters closed down. But in the mid-1990s, as South Asians grew tired of the poor quality of the videotapes -- or perhaps just craved an evening out -- cinemas regained their popularity.\nToday, Indian films can be found playing all over the country, with one Web site listing almost 100 cinemas in 20 states. In California, for example, the Naz8 cinemas feature eight-screen multiplexes, many showing the same films as Mr. Shah's theater.\nMr. Shah and Naz8 share a large part of the American market, although they face competition from distributors of Indian films who make deals with American theater owners on their own, Mr. Pandya said.\nAbout 6:30 on Wednesday night, Mr. Shah buzzed around the lobby of the cinema with a walkie-talkie as the crowds poured in.\nTushar Gupta and his friends, all college students, took a bus here, trusting that Govinda, a star of ''Bhagam Bhag,'' would make them laugh.\n''Let's hope he lives up to expectations,'' Mr. Gupta said. Govinda's return to the screen after a hiatus in politics was one of many entertainment subplots here, a comeback almost everyone seemed to comment on.\nBirender Anand, 20, waited for his cousin in front of a large, cardboard diorama for ''Dhoom 2,'' a popular action movie featuring brooding, gorgeous Bollywood stars. He was home from college in Ohio, and happy to be among so many Indians. Mr. Anand said his turban drew a lot of attention in Ohio -- ''I get stuff all the time.''\nLines formed, showtimes passed, the cinema became busier and Mr. Shah became irritable, at one point threatening to cancel a screening if order was not restored in a line. Afterward, he would not say how many tickets had been sold, and was generally secretive when it came to business affairs, citing worries about competitors. But that night, several hundred people watched films at his six cinemas, which seat approximately 1,300 people.\nMr. Shah said he had plans to expand his audience, perhaps by showing films in Spanish, Korean and Japanese. ''I can do this with passion,'' he said. ''I do my homework. I am the janitor and the owner.''\nAsked if he was ready to open an all-Indian movie theater, maybe with the help of an outside investor, Mr. Shah said there was not enough business to make such a project sustainable.\nBut Mr. Mehta said it was only a matter of time before a multiscreen theater showing only Indian films opened in the area.\n''I think there should be some kind of landmark status, some kind of protection for places like this,'' he said.\nHe explained that unlike those in the United States, many cinemas in India were divided by class, ranging from multiplexes with waiters to traveling tents.\n''What unites the people in the audience here is love of Bollywood films, and homesickness,'' he said. ''For three hours, they are momentarily sated by watching these creatures of light.''
1816127	Home Prices Fall Just a Bit; Brokers See 'Soft Landing'	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE6DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Sale prices for Manhattan apartments fell in the last quarter of 2006, while the pace of sales was reported to be strong and the backlog of unsold apartments fell, according to several market studies released yesterday by large real estate brokerage firms.\nThe new quarterly numbers led brokers and market analysts to conclude that the Manhattan real estate market -- with its legendary high prices -- appeared to have so far escaped the worst of the real estate market excesses, like large price cuts by developers, reported across the country.\n''It shows us that we hit the soft landing that a lot of people were hoping for,'' said Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared market studies for two brokerage firms, Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property.\nThe new figures were also reported in a series of competitive and sometimes contradictory studies. One report, released by Prudential Douglas Elliman, reported a 5 percent decline in the average apartment sale price, compared with the previous quarter, while one by the Corcoran Group put the decline at 1.5 percent. Both put the average sale price for all apartments at more than $1.2 million.\nA third study by Mr. Heym showed that average apartment prices actually increased by 5 percent from the prior quarter. But even this study showed weakness in the market. It found that prices for co-ops, the older apartments that make up most of Manhattan's residential real estate, declined by 5 percent, with these declines offset by increased sale prices for condominiums. He said more than half the sales were in new luxury buildings that command premium prices.\nYet what heartened many market watchers was the market's overall stability, and the rising sales, according to the Prudential report, in what is traditionally a weak quarter. Average prices were higher last quarter than they were in the same quarter a year ago. For all of 2006, average prices were also higher than the previous year, which included the peak quarters of the recent real estate boom.\nAt the end of December, the Prudential report found that the backlog of unsold apartments had dropped to 5,934 from 7,623, a decline of 22 percent and slightly below the inventory reported a year before, as apartments were sold and overpriced apartments were taken off the market.\nAt the same time, the Prudential report tracked 2,441 sales in the last quarter of 2006, an increase of 15.5 percent from the prior quarter and a 55 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2005.\nJonathan J. Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., prepared the Prudential report. He said some of the increase in sales might be exaggerated because of improved reporting by New York City, which last summer began providing sales information for previously undisclosed co-op sales. But he said that the increase in reported sales was the largest he had seen in several years, especially in the fourth quarter when sales typically decline an average of 8 percent.\nBut he said that he believed the market was strengthening and that it was now ''just barely'' a buyer's market, but one in which buyers were frustrated because sellers were not making significant concessions. He found that the average discount from the final asking price for an apartment fell to 2.8 percent from 4 percent in the previous quarter.\nPamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group, said that sellers are now generally pricing their apartments realistically, and that with the economy strong and Wall Street bonuses high, ''the psychology of the market is very positive.''\n''The big story here is the story that never happened,'' she said. ''The story was supposed to be that prices would crash in 2006, and a strong buyer's market will emerge. Buyers can certainly pick and choose, but those who think they are going to have a field day out there right now are mistaken.''\nMs. Liebman said the fear of a price collapse caused by a construction boom has not been borne out so far, and the outlook remained good for this year. She said several thousand planned condominiums have instead been turned into hotels and office buildings, as hotel profits and office rentals have risen.\nThe trends in the Manhattan real estate market have always been something of a puzzle, since the average and median prices tend to move up and down with the changing mix of large and small apartments and of apartments in old and new buildings.\nIn addition, the various market studies augment public records of sales with private databases compiled by brokers and appraisers of recent closings that have not yet been reported by the city.\nNew building sales also distort the data, since sales often close up to a year or more after they go to contract. Ms. Liebman predicted that average sale prices would rise next year as contracts already signed at new expensive luxury buildings with multiple sales of more than $10 million, like 15 Central Park West and the Plaza on Fifth Avenue, are completed.\nSeveral reports showed significant price increases in very large apartments with four or more bedrooms and in studios. The reports generally showed the largest increases in very large apartments with four or more bedrooms, with declines in average prices for two-bedroom apartments, which still averaged above $1.5 million per apartment.\nOverall, 2006 ended with an average price increase of 6 percent over the previous year's sales, Mr. Miller said, while the median went up by 11 percent.\nMr. Heym, the economist at Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, attributed the continued strength of the market to the local economy, which he said has produced more jobs last year than in any year since the 2000 boom, and that interest rates that have remained low. Mr. Heym said, ''2006 turned out to be a really good year, much better than people thought.''

Ford at his funeral service here.\nPresident Bush, who escorted Mr. Ford's widow, Betty, into the church, addressed the invited guests. Three former presidents -- Bill Clinton, George Bush and Jimmy Carter -- also came to pay their final respects, accompanied by their wives, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York; Barbara Bush; and Rosalynn Carter. Nancy Reagan, the widow of President Ronald Reagan, whose funeral was held in the cathedral in 2004, also attended the service.\nThe mourners included Shimon Peres, the former Israeli prime minister, and several members of Congress, including Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California, the incoming House speaker, and J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the departing speaker. John G. Roberts Jr., the chief justice of the United States, took his seat in the cavernous cathedral, as did Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City. Adrian M. Fenty, who was sworn in as mayor of Washington on Tuesday morning, also attended.\nFor many former Ford administration officials, the service was a somber reunion. The honorary pallbearers included Vice President Dick Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld, former defense secretary, who both served as chief of staff to Mr. Ford; Henry A. Kissinger, former secretary of state; Brent Scowcroft, former national security adviser; and Alan Greenspan, who led Mr. Ford's council of economic advisers years before he became chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nThese were among the prominent guests:\nBUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; Defense Secretary Robert M.

1816129	Dollar's Skid Puts a Glow On the Euro	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E5DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	The dollar slumped yesterday and the euro climbed to a three-week high against the currency.\nA steady slide in the value of the dollar since late 2005, primarily against the euro and the British pound, has steepened over the last month amid indications that interest rates will rise in Europe, while the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates this year.\nAt the same time, countries with large dollar holdings are showing a new willingness to dump the dollar in favor of the rising euro, though the current activity is seen as posing little long-term risk to the dollar.\nLate last month, the United Arab Emirates became the latest country to shift more of its currency reserves away from the dollar, joining Russia, Switzerland, Venezuela and others.\nThose moves coincide with ambiguous signals from China about possibly pulling back from the dollar, and recent word from Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, that it would prefer euros as payment for oil, which is typically priced in dollars.\nBut currency experts say that this turn away from the dollar is not likely to do any long-term damage to the currency's value for a number of reasons. First, the motives of central banks that are adding other currencies to their reserves do not appear to be driven by the belief that the euro will eventually supplant the dollar as the world's key currency. Rather, these central banks are doing what investors do to cut risk: diversifying their portfolios.\nMoreover, the amount of currency moved so far has been relatively small in a global market that trades trillions of dollars a day -- only about $2 billion in the case of the United Arab Emirates, for example.\n''There is some indication that central banks are moving to diversify reserves, but it's at a very slow pace,'' said David Powell, a currency analyst with IDEAglobal. ''Is it the start of a massive shift out of the dollar? I would say no.''\nYesterday, the euro traded at $1.3272, up from $1.3198 late Friday in New York. The British pound was at $1.9721, up from $1.9586. The United States dollar index, a measure of the dollar's strength against a basket of currencies, fell to 83.23 from 83.65 on Friday. In February 2002, the index was at 120.\nBut trading was thinner than usual yesterday as financial markets were closed in the United States, as were markets in Tokyo and Singapore.\nIn 2006, the euro appreciated more than 11 percent against the dollar, while the British pound rose nearly 14 percent against the dollar.\nBut the dollar is not likely to start flowing with great speed out of central banks because foreign countries risk devaluing their investments if they do so. Even the slightest suggestion that a country is thinking about swapping dollars for euros risks sending the value of the dollar falling, and in turn hurts all foreign investors in American securities.\nThe case of China, which holds more Treasury securities than any other foreign nation except Japan, offers an example of why countries would be reluctant to dump their dollar reserves. In October, the most recent month for which figures are available from the Treasury Department, China held $345 billion in Treasury securities. That was up from $301 billion a year earlier. Its currency holdings total $1 trillion. About $700 billion of that, economists estimate, is in dollars.\nSo in many ways, it is in China's best interest not to let the dollar's value slip. Heavy sales of the dollar could make it harder for the People's Bank of China to manage its gradual appreciation of the yuan against the dollar. Anything more abrupt, Beijing fears, would make Chinese goods less competitive in the United States and pose problems domestically for some of the loans from its state banks. And if the dollar drops too much, the value of China's holdings would decrease, limiting the lending ability of its banks.\nNonetheless, the rising euro is not something the United States or foreign investors can afford to ignore.\n''You have to start to thinking that the euro can be of some risk to the dollar,'' said Shaun Osbourne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. ''Over the course of the next 5 or 10 years, I don't think there's any danger that the dollar's pre-eminence is threatened. But in the long run, there is certainly the risk that does happen.''\nOne issue driving investors from the dollar is the possibility that interest rates in the United States and Europe may move farther apart.\nFinancial markets are currently expecting at least one interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve sometime next year. That contrasts with predictions of further rate increases by the European Central Bank.\n''A lot of foreign investors think the Fed is going to cut rates in 2007, and that's a rather dollar-bearish thing,'' said Julia Coronado, senior economist with Barclays Capital.\nSome economists predict the dollar will fall further in 2007. The euro finished 2006 at $1.31, and some economists see it climbing near $1.40 -- a high in its seven-year history.\n''We believe that the dollar's decline versus the euro has further to run, with $1.38 a possible destination for the pair over the next six months,'' said Tom Levinson, a foreign exchange strategist with ING Wholesale Banking in London.\nStill, many economists are unwilling to predict that the dollar faces an inevitable demise. ''The dollar is still the world's No. 1 currency, and it's going to stay that way,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for Global Insight. ''The euro is gradually going to become more important, but I don't see it becoming more important than the dollar.''
1816130	Sensing Opportunity in Dormitory Air	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E5DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	College stinks. Just ask Emily Watson, a sophomore at Dartmouth, who sprays her dorm room once a week and her clothes two to three times a week with fresheners, usually in citrus or other fruity flavors.\nMs. Watson did not grow up using air fresheners, but a Febreze commercial two years ago changed all that. ''If you're in a frat basement or something, you kind of stink afterwards, and you want to wear your jeans the next day,'' Ms. Watson said.\nYounger customers like Ms. Watson are at the forefront of the boom in air fresheners, which have grown up since the first Air Wicks and Glade sprays hit the shelves two generations ago. Glade's first sprays in evergreen and blossom scents appeared in 1956 and were marketed to suburban families as a way to banish cooking and tobacco smells. Since then, thousands of new products have made their debuts -- plug-ins, fragrance fans, diffusers, flashing light shows -- becoming pricier and fancier every year.\nThese days, air fresheners are selling to a wider range of customers, as companies pour more money into advertisements that show people of all ages, male and female, euphorically smelling their ''clean'' air.\nProcter & Gamble introduced Febreze air products in 2004, after sensing a growing market, and put its marketing heft behind them. Sales across the industry have soared as a result, up 50 percent, or nearly $600 million since 2003, according to Kline & Company, a market research firm in New Jersey. Total sales are expected to reach $1.72 billion in the United States this year, the firm said.\n''P.& G. came from nowhere,'' said William Schmitz, a senior analyst with Deutsche Bank. ''And they expanded the category.''\nFebreze has become popular with young people who go barhopping and come home with smelly sweaters, Mr. Schmitz said.\nIndeed, Procter & Gamble sought such customers by creating offbeat Febreze ads featuring young 20-somethings -- men and women -- making air fresheners seem cool. The company used much the same approach to marketing for its Swiffer cleaning products, with one of them appearing in the hands of Jessica Simpson on a Rolling Stone cover in 2003.\nOne of the first Febreze air freshener products was designed to look like a CD player. Febreze Scentstories, released in 2004, features ''stop'' and ''play'' buttons and ''discs'' that radiate scents rather than music. The disc titled ''Wandering Barefoot on the Shore'' features scents like ''splashing in the waves'' and ''sailing in the bay.''\n''Teenage girls are very scent-involved, generally speaking,'' said John Paquin, executive vice president and global account director for Febreze at Grey Worldwide, a WPP Group agency. ''You can't have enough scent with teenage girls.''\nShoppers looking to brighten their air will find plenty of options. More than 1,000 new fresheners hit the market last year, exceeding the number for 2005 and 2004 combined, according to the Productscan Online service of Datamonitor.\nCompanies that make air fresheners, like SC Johnson, maker of Glade; Reckitt Benckiser, maker of Air Wick; and Procter & Gamble say they are responding to consumer demand. Scent, they say, has become more important to consumers.\n''Fragrance for some people is a natural expression of themselves,'' said Tammy Maier-Jones, category manager for Glade. ''They want their friends to come over and say, 'That's Linda's scent,' or 'Mary's scent.' ''\nSC Johnson spent only $31 million on Glade ads in 2003, before Febreze; it has since increased its spending by more than $30 million a year, bringing Glade to Febreze's level, according to Nielsen Monitor-Plus, a unit of VNU. ''There's an explosion of activity in this segment,'' said Michelle Dauchy, category manager for Glade.\nFebreze commercials now account for about 30 percent of air freshener commercials, and about 40 percent of the money spent buying TV air time in the category. Procter & Gamble spent $58 million for Febreze commercials in the first nine months of 2006, overshadowing Reckitt Benckiser's $31 million and just above SC Johnson's $55 million in that period, Monitor-Plus numbers show.\nSC Johnson released a Glade product in August directly for tweens, or girls 8 to 12 years old, and teenage girls. Its Scented Oil Light Show plugs into walls and beams bright colors and scents like Berry Burst, Watermelon Rush and Vanilla & Cream. Glade commercials for the Light Show feature a teenage girl in a bathrobe complaining that her mother bought the freshener for her younger brother rather than for her.\nThe company developed a tween-focused Web site for the Light Show and ran a contest online for teenagers to win ''the ultimate slumber party'' with Vanessa Anne Hudgens, star of the Disney show ''High School Musical.'' Ten pairs of best friends won the contest and hung out with Ms. Hudgens in Hollywood in November.\nThe Glade Create-a-Scent PlugIn, released in 2004, also appeals to young shoppers. Tweens have long made their own perfume potions, and the Glade product provides suggested combinations of its scents.\nAir Wick introduced a new look for some of its fresheners last July with animated commercials, featuring elephant and octopus characters.\nThese new products tend to be pricey. The Febreze ''players'' cost $27.49 and discs are $5.99 apiece. The Glade Light Show costs $11.99. But then teenagers today have more discretionary money than those of past generations, analysts said.\n''The teenager today is purchasing what prior generations have looked to buy when they became young career professionals,'' said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, a retail research company. ''Younger consumers are much older today, in terms of what they're buying.''\nMothers and older consumers remain important to air freshener companies, and many advertisements continue to be directed at people with families. About three-quarters of households bought air fresheners last year, according to an ACNielsen Homescan Consumer Facts report. Ad executives said there had also been significant growth in the last few years among those traditional customers.\n''It used to be that home environment stopped at décor, and now scent is brought in as another dimension,'' said Tammy Anthony, executive director for client services in the Cincinnati office of Landor Associates, a WPP Group agency that works with Procter & Gamble on Febreze. ''Today's consumers crave experiences that touch all of their senses.''\nAbout 40 percent of people who buy air products started buying them in the last six years, according to a recent survey by MarketTools, a firm based in San Francisco that does consumer research for Procter & Gamble and other packaged goods companies.\nAbout half of the people buying air scents said they were now putting them in more rooms than they used to. The living room, kitchen, bathrooms and master bedroom are the most popular, but fresheners are also showing up in the oldest child's room, the survey found.\nTeenagers are sometimes encouraged to make their rooms smell better by their parents, but they are also seeking out the scents themselves. About a third of teenagers with scented air in their rooms buy the fresheners themselves, a third ask their parents to buy them, and the other third said their parents put the freshener in, according to a survey by Weekly Reader Research, a research firm in Stamford, Conn., that specializes in teenagers.\nThe survey, while not scientific, interviewed 1,500 teenagers online and found that two-thirds used air fresheners. Of those, about a third said advertisements had convinced them their rooms could smell better.\nJessica Ray, a freshman at Williams College, said she liked having a dorm room scent that could be smelled all the way down her hallway. She has been using an apple-cinnamon-scented Glade PlugIn, but in the spring, she says, she'll switch to something flowery. Her family in Virginia did not use fresheners when she was growing up, but Ms. Ray said she was likely to continue to buy them throughout her life.\nEven specialty retailers are seeking young buyers. Anne Taintor Inc., a specialty retailer for women that uses vintage images and a playful sense of attitude in its products, has found that a lemon-gelatin-scented freshener sells well among college students.\n''Young people are more oriented towards the inside than the outside,'' said Christina White, the company's senior vice president for marketing. ''They're in front of their computers. They're not taking long walks in the woods. The idea of scent tended to be a personal thing, but younger people are seeing it in a much broader way. They want to control everything around them in their own spaces.''\nIt is not just teenage girls who are enjoying scented rooms. Boys, too, are customers. Unilever has had success selling its Axe line of body sprays aimed at young men in the last few years, and Weekly Reader Research found that about 60 percent of its male respondents used fresheners, just 10 percentage points fewer than the teenage girls surveyed.\nMohammad Usman, a freshman at Dartmouth, said that most of his friends of both sexes were scent savvy. He showed up for college this fall with about a dozen fresheners he brought from home, he said. He sprays them about once a week.\n''I go to the gym every day, and I come back and it always smells because my laundry bag is there,'' Mr. Usman said. ''Tonight, I'm throwing a movie night, so before I clean my room, I'm going to spray some Febreze.''\nADVERTISING
1816131	Fighting Over Gold In the Land of Dracula	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E5DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Eugen David, a small-time farmer with a chipped tooth and muddy boots in this obscure wrinkle of Transylvania, is an unlikely man to attract the attention of movie stars and moguls. But he counts Vanessa Redgrave, George Soros and Teddy Goldsmith among his backers in a land battle with a Canadian gold mining company.\nThe company, Gabriel Resources, owns the rights to mine the hills here and wants Mr. David, 41, to leave his 50 acres of land so that the company can carve out what would be Europe's largest open-pit gold mine. Mr. David says he isn't budging.\n''We don't want to move,'' he says, staring across at the brown-gray stain of Rosia Montana's defunct gold mine, which would be swallowed by Gabriel Resource's huge project.\nIn the old days, a pipsqueak like Mr. David wouldn't stand a chance fighting powerful and sophisticated adversaries like Gabriel Resources and its minority partner, the Romanian government.\nBut this is the Internet age, when local activists like Mr. David can tap into an increasingly well-oiled global network of non-governmental organizations for financial and political support on a long list of causes and emerge with almost as much clout as any corporation.\nMr. David's stubbornness has struck a chord with the anti-globalization movement. Gabriel Resources' proposed open-pit, cyanide-leaching mining process has also drawn the ire of international environmentalists who are now trying to stop it.\nThey just might win.\nMining is one of the world's most unpopular pursuits these days, particularly the gigantic gouging that leaves the earth pocked with moonscape-like craters a mile or more wide. Gold mining is disdained even more because of the perceived frivolity of its end: to provide lucre for the rich, status for the everyman and hidden stores of wealth for nations.\nBut it also has a strong allure, particularly for resource-rich countries like Romania that are struggling to develop impoverished communities that need jobs.\nThe $3.7 billion project would plow more than $2 billion into the Romanian economy and could earn Gabriel Resources and its shareholders profits of $1 billion or more. And the company involved here, a Toronto-based corporation with market capitalization of $1 billion, is run by savvy mining executives, many of them highly experienced from cutting their teeth building the Barrick Gold Corporation, the largest gold mining company in the world.\nThe allure is perhaps stronger in Romania because the country was created, in a way, by gold mining.\nEarly in the second century A.D., Emperor Trajan extended Roman territory to include what is now Transylvania, in the western half of Romania, to mine Europe's most important gold deposits. The mines helped finance the expansion of the empire to its peak. When the Romans abandoned the territory almost 200 years later, they left behind colonists who are the ancestors of Romanians today.\nWhen the Romans left, the mining did not stop. The eventual ruling dynasty, the Hapsburgs, and the Communists, who turned to open-pit mining, continued the process, though with dwindling efficiency. The mine was finally shut in early 2006.\nGabriel Resources was born in the breakup of the state-owned economy after Communism's collapse when Romanian businessmen with little mining experience and suspected ties to the former secret police won a vast concession to exploit mineral deposits.\nMr. David and his neighbors realized six years ago that the company planned to expand the old mine and formed an association called Alburnus Maior -- Rosia Montana's Roman name -- to try to stop the project. They were engaged in an ineffective letter-writing campaign when the founders of Gabriel Resources moved the company's listing from Vancouver, British Columbia, to the more respectable Toronto Stock Exchange.\nMr. David's opposition might have withered had it not been for an ill-advised plan to build a Dracula theme park near the picturesque Romanian town of Sighisoara, once home to Vlad Dracula, the notorious Romanian ruler and inspiration for ''Dracula,'' the Bram Stoker novel.\nPrince Charles of Britain, fond of Romania's old Saxon villages, was outraged. So was Teddy Goldsmith, the aging anti-globalist environmentalist and scion of a wealthy business family.\nA Swiss-born environmental journalist named Stephanie Roth, who wrote for Mr. Goldsmith's magazine, The Ecologist, moved to Romania to help defeat the project. With such powerful forces aligned against it, the theme park for Sighisoara died. While in Romania, Ms. Roth heard about the Gabriel Resources' plan for Rosia Montana and went to meet Mr. David in April 2002. Within months, she had introduced him to some of the most powerful environmental organizations in the world.\n''When I came there was no computer, no Web site,'' Ms. Roth said. ''I tried to empower the local organization.''\nMs. Roth started by helping Mr. David's group obtain a grant for a few hundred dollars from an American environmental organization, Global Greengrants Fund. They organized a public hearing in Rosia Montana that drew 40 non-governmental organizations with Romanian operations, including Greenpeace, and catapulted Mr. David's dispute onto the national stage.\nThen Ms. Roth took to the road. By the time Gabriel Resources' founders turned the company over to more professional management in 2005, the company had an international coalition of nongovernmental organizations arrayed against it.\nBut the mining industry doesn't easily back down.\nHoping to extract an estimated 300 tons of gold and 1,200 tons of silver from the mine, Gabriel Resources introduced a public relations campaign with Madison Avenue-style television commercials and community sponsorships to win over 960 Rosia Montana families that it needed to relocate. It cast itself as an economic savior. It even countered a critical documentary with its own film, ''Mine Your Own Business.''\nSome efforts backfired. Gabriel Resources helped sponsor the Transylvanian International Film Festival in nearby Cluj-Napoca. But when its organizers invited Ms. Redgrave to receive a lifetime achievement award, Ms. Roth quickly put the actress and Mr. David together.\nMs. Redgrave's acceptance speech became a rallying cry against Gabriel Resources' project. The anti-Gabriel Resources' movement had its mascot and the European press began covering the story.\nWord of the movement had by then reached the Open Society Institute of George Soros, which has been working for years for more accountability from Romanian public officials.\n''When guys in S.U.V.'s with bags full of cash show up in a poor locality in Romania, they can really make the law there,'' said Radu Motoc, project director of the Open Society Foundation-Romania.\nNearly all members of Rosia Montana's former and current council are either employed by Rosia Montana Gold, Gabriel's local subsidiary, or have family members who are, according to the foundation.\nThe foundation, which has already given $35,000 to the cause, says it plans to spend as much as $240,000 next year fighting the project and helping Mr. David. Because of the polarizing debate surrounding open-pit gold mining, it is hard to find an unbiased commentator to assess the risks and benefits of Gabriel Resources' proposed mine. A major focus of contention is the use of large quantities of highly toxic cyanide to separate gold and silver from the ore.\nIn 1999, Aurul, a joint venture of the Australian mining company, Esmeralda Exploration, and a Romanian national company, Remin, began a leaching operation to recover gold from old tailings in Baia Mare, or Great Mine, roughly 80 miles north of Rosia Montana. Like Gabriel Resources, the company promised a state-of-the-art, self-contained project that would not pose risks to the environment. But less than a year later, the dam holding back a lake of cyanide-laced water burst, sending 100,000 cubic meters of contaminated water downstream to the Danube, killing more than 1,200 tons of fish in Hungary.\nGabriel Resources says it would build in safeguards that were missing at Baia Mare. It has promised to convert most of the cyanide into a nontoxic compound before discharging it into the mine's tailing pond. It also promises to clean up pollution left by past mining operations and spend $70 million to do as much as possible to repair the altered landscape after its project is done.\n''Arsenic, cadmium, nickel, lead,'' said Catalin Hosu, a public relations official for Gabriel Resources, ticking off just a few of the heavy metals that leach from ancient mines to give this valley its name; Rosia Montana means red mountain.\n''We help the biodiversity; we help the environment,'' said Yani Roditis, Gabriel Resources' chief operating officer.\nThat's difficult for many people here to believe. The new project will grind down several hills, leaving four deep pits in their place, and slowly fill an entire valley with wastewater and tailings that will take years to solidify.\nRobert E. Moran, a mining expert hired by the opposition to evaluate the impact of Gabriel Resources' plans, said that the mine, despite detoxification, would inevitably produce other toxic byproducts damaging to the environment, including heavy metals.\nThe controversy, meanwhile, has splintered the town, its buildings divided between those with signs that read, ''Property of Rosia Montana Gold Corp.'' and others that say, ''This Property Is Not For Sale.''\n''I was born here, so why should I leave?'' said Gabriela Jorka, 38, who runs a small general store in Rosia Montana. ''I'd rather kill myself.''\nEugen Bobar, 60, the school principal, says that the dispute is pitting parents against children, husbands against wives. But only about 40 percent of the families to be relocated remain, and Mr. Bobar predicts that most of them will leave. ''Most of the people who talk about the environment are just making an excuse,'' Mr. Bobar said, sitting in the school's office late one night. ''They will leave for a good price.''\nMr. David, however, insists there is a committed core of opponents who will not sell, whatever the offer. In that case, Gabriel Resources warns, it may ask the state to step in and move people out by force. But that could lead to years of legal wrangling.\nThe company has told its shareholders that it expects to receive final approval for the project from the Romanian government this year and will start producing gold by mid-2009.\nGabriel Resources, which is based in Toronto, is, meanwhile, trying to win over the remaining holdouts. It is sponsoring education for underprivileged children in Rosia Montana through a nongovernmental organization run by Leslie Hawke, the mother of the actor Ethan Hawke and a celebrity herself in Romania. She supports the project.\n''It's probably better that nothing happened, but the gold is there and if they don't do it, somebody else will,'' Ms. Hawke said. ''And I'd rather that they do it than somebody else.''
1816132	It's the Year To Keep an Eye On Paychecks	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E5DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Do you remember all those books from the 1980s and '90s explaining why the United States couldn't keep up with Japan? Once they were proved wrong, pundits came forth with a new batch of titles to explain why the American boom might last forever. The masterwork of the genre was ''Dow 36,000.''\nAfter the Dow sank, the optimists took a few years off before re-emerging. My favorite recent entry on the shelf of misbegotten titles was ''Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?'' from 2005.\nMaking economic predictions, suffice it to say, is often a fool's game, but it is played with particular relish every time the calendar turns to a new year. Today, let's try a slightly different approach.\nThere is no way to know what 2007 will bring. You can make a pretty good argument that the country is due for a financial crisis -- or that the economy is about to swing up again. But while the answer may be uncertain, it's clear that the single biggest economic question of the year will probably be this:\nWill the surge in the paychecks of ordinary Americans continue in 2007?\nIn 2006, a slowly improving job market finally grew strong enough to bring solid pay increases to most workers. Thanks to falling oil prices, meanwhile, inflation plummeted. As a result, the real average wage of rank-and-file workers -- a group that makes up about 80 percent of the work force -- has risen more than 2 percent over the last year. That pace has been reached only one other time in the last three decades, at the peak of the great 1990s boom.\nSo for arguably the first time in the 21st century, a year has just ended with most Americans economically better off than they were when it began. Besides bringing a much-needed improvement in American living standards, this wage surge is also creating a fascinating political dynamic.\nWhen the Democrats formally take control of Congress tomorrow, they will do so with a firm belief that economic anxiety helped bring about their victory. They are probably right, too. For most of the last five years, wages weren't keeping up with inflation, debt was rising and the number of people without health insurance was growing. In exit polls on Election Day, only 30 percent of respondents said they expected life for the next generation of Americans to be better than life today.\nBut there has been no better predictor of the public's mood over the last three decades than the direction of real wages. When they are down, as they were in 1980 and 1992, political earthquakes tend to follow. When wages are rising, fears that seemed on their way to becoming permanent start to disappear.\nBefore the present wage surge began, back in the fall, the country seemed to be on course for a serious debate about how to deal with rising inequality. Despite a solid economic expansion that started in late 2001, most families weren't benefiting. Even the average raises for college graduates, who had done so well in the 1990s, fell behind inflation. Only the very rich -- the Google and Goldman Sachs set -- were doing well.\n''In the age of globalization and outsourcing, and with a vast underground labor pool from illegal immigration, the average American worker is seeing a different life and a troubling future,'' Jim Webb, the newly elected Democratic Senator from Virginia, wrote in The Wall Street Journal last year.\nTo varying degrees, the Democrats now starting their 2008 presidential campaigns have been making a similar argument. The mood is -- or, depending on your view, was -- similar to the one that afflicted the country in the early and mid-1990s.\nBack then, voters fired or demoted nearly every powerful politician in Washington within two years, from George H. W. Bush (in 1992) to the Democratic leaders of Congress (in 1994). A couple of years later, Newsweek magazine ran one of the more alarmist covers you'll see: head shots of chief executives who had ordered layoffs next to the headline ''Corporate Killers.'' Just three years after that article, with the '90s boom at its peak, polls showed American optimism at an all-time high.\nIt isn't too difficult to see how the recent pessimism may go the way of ''Corporate Killers'' headlines. Consumer confidence has already started rising, with people saying they remain anxious about the future yet feel better about the present, according to the University of Michigan.\nSome economists and politicians have tried to play down the recent pay increases by saying that they're nothing more than a reflection of a one-time drop in oil prices. But that's not really accurate. Nominal pay -- the numbers you see in your paycheck -- has actually been rising at a good clip. It has increased more than 4 percent over the last year, just as it did at the peak of the 1980s and 1990s expansions.\nThe trouble until the last few months was that inflation was unusually high. Now that it has settled back around 2 percent, not much below its average of the last decade, the current expansion is indeed benefiting most workers.\nAs Edward Lazear, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, points out, the strong hiring of the last few months suggests the wage gains will continue. ''There's nothing that says this has to turn around,'' he said.\nOn the other hand, there are a few reasons to worry. The housing slump has caused economic growth to fall to a dangerously low level. Overnight shipments of FedEx packages, a good economic barometer, have slowed sharply in recent months.\nAnd it's not as if the country used the expansion of the last five years to put its economic house in order. ''We're all hoping that this is not another episodic movement of real wages before they fall again,'' Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, said. ''But I don't see us positioned in the same way we were in the mid-90s prior to the huge takeoff.''\nMy own guess -- see, writers can't help themselves -- is that pay will keep rising in 2007. But given the budget deficit, Iraq and other problems, the economy doesn't seem on the verge of another golden period like the late '90s.\nMaybe this combination wouldn't be the worst thing. It would give workers an overdue raise, but it would also remind us that technology and globalization really have changed the rules. Absent a speculative bubble, like the one in the 1990s that artificially heated up the economy, pay increases don't come as easily for most families as they once did. Even in the best case, 2007 will be the sixth year of the current expansion and only the first full year of healthy pay gains.\nECONOMIX
1816133	Layoffs Imminent At Inquirer	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E5DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Philadelphia Inquirer is expected to announce today that it will lay off 68 to 71 employees, or about 17 percent of the newsroom staff, just seven months after a group of local businessmen took over the newspaper and its sister publication, The Daily News.\nThe Daily News is exempt from this round of cuts.\nThe announcements began last night as editors called employees at home. The news will become official today when top editors begin a series of meetings with each department. With The Inquirer's advertising revenue and circulation down, employees have known for months that layoffs were coming and have been finding their place on the seniority list so that they could try to make plans.\n''The guillotine has finally fallen,'' said Dawn Fallik, 36, a medical reporter for The Inquirer who has been at the paper for four years and will be laid off. ''In a way, it's kind of a relief.''\nThe Newspaper Guild, which represents newsroom and other employees at the two papers, just concluded bitter contract negotiations that nearly led to a strike. Editors and reporters had been told that if they did not make economic concessions, up to 150 people could be laid off.\n''This number is significantly less than the numbers that had been discussed earlier,'' said Jay Devine, a spokesman for Brian P. Tierney, the publisher of the papers and one of the new owners.\nStill, the layoffs will continue a contraction of The Inquirer, which in its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s had a staff of more than 500, with 15 foreign bureaus. Today, the staff numbers about 400, with one foreign bureau. It lost more than 75 people in buyouts a year ago. The Daily News cut 25, leaving its newsroom with about 109.\nAmong those who received calls last night and was told he was losing his job was Jeff Shields, a reporter who covers gambling, a young and growing industry in Pennsylvania.\n''These last two weeks, knowing this was coming, have really been Kafkaesque,'' said Mr. Shields, 41, who has been at the paper for almost four years. He said he hoped to parlay his knowledge of the gambling industry into a job at a paying Web site or doing research.\nA subject he would like to write about is the effect of casinos on their hometowns -- ''the kind of story you might pitch to an editor but in this day and age would never get approved,'' he said, alluding to declining ambitions at many daily newspapers.\nHis editor, Eugene Kiely, 47, who made the call to Mr. Shields, is also leaving The Inquirer, although voluntarily, and will take a job at USA Today. He said he wanted to continue his newspaper career at a place he thought would be ''stable.''\nThe Philadelphia papers were sold in March by Knight Ridder to the McClatchy newspaper group, which in turn sold them to a group of businessmen, led by Mr. Tierney, an advertising and public relations executive.\nMr. Tierney hailed his entry into the newspaper business as a turning point, both for the Philadelphia papers and the industry, as he took the reins from a distant corporate owner and began a closely watched experiment in local private ownership without having to answer to Wall Street.\nBut things changed in the summer as advertising revenue for papers across the country plummeted and circulation continued its years of decline. At The Inquirer, the consolidation of department stores and telecommunications companies has meant fewer ads, with revenue falling 10 percent in September 2006, from September 2005. Daily circulation fell 7.6 percent, to 330,000, in the last year. Sunday circulation was down 4.5 percent, to 682,000, in the same period.\nThe newsroom was initially cautious but hopeful when Mr. Tierney took over. Since the contract settlement, however, the mood has shifted to resignation.\n''If it's a new day for local journalism, it's a sour day,'' said Stu Bykofsky, a columnist at The Daily News. At least with Knight Ridder, he said, there were buyouts, not layoffs.\nA few years ago, The Inquirer hired more than 40 young reporters as part of a major expansion into the suburbs. Now, many of those jobs are being eliminated.\nIn the recent contract negotiations, the company won the right to exempt certain reporting beats from seniority rules so it could keep some of the younger reporters, depending on how much time they had spent on a beat. Diane Mastrull, 46, a reporter and Guild negotiator for the newsroom, said this winnowing process could set reporters against each other as they add up time spent on various beats.\n''We'll now watch a really ugly process,'' she said. ''And despite all of that sacrifice at the negotiating table, we're still going to watch 70 people involuntarily walk out the door.''\nMr. Devine, the spokesman for Mr. Tierney, said that the contract settlement with the Guild and nine other unions at the papers were an important milestone in saving money at the paper.\nCirculation at The Inquirer is already nudging up because of new marketing campaigns and a focus on the suburbs, he said, calling it ''the first step in getting advertisers interested.'' Mr. Devine said that investments in new production technology would bolster the appeal to advertisers.\nMr. Tierney, he said, ''remains buoyant'' about the future of the newspapers.\nBut some of those out of a job have a different view.\n''I loved being a reporter, and I hope to continue writing,'' Ms. Fallik said, ''but I'm open to something completely different.''\nMr. Shields said: ''Newspapers have not shown a whole lot of economic promise, so for me this is a chance to look around and maybe become part of a more dynamic business model.

1816134	Itche Goldberg, Yiddish Advocate, 102	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E4DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Itche Goldberg, a champion of Yiddish who wrote and edited and taught his beloved language in the face of all those who said keeping Yiddish alive was a lost cause, died last Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 102.\nHe died of complications of cancer, his son, David, said.\nPassing on the Yiddish tradition to future generations was the passion of Itche Goldberg's life. He promoted the language in every conceivable form: writing poetry, librettos, children's books and essays and running Yiddish schools and summer camps. His book ''Yiddish Stories for Young People'' is still used in the shrinking network of secular Yiddish schools.\nMr. Goldberg's final collection of essays in Yiddish, ''Essayen Tsvey'' (''Essays Two''), was published in 2004 on his 100th birthday.\nIn secular Yiddish circles, Mr. Goldberg is best known as the editor of one of the longest-running journals of Yiddish literature, Yidishe Kultur. He served as editor from 1964 to 2004, when he published the journal's final issue.\nMr. Goldberg was a veteran of the heated ideological wars of the 20th century over Judaism, Yiddish, socialism and communism. He quit a job at a Yiddish summer camp in Canada in the 1920s after a fight with the anarchist Emma Goldman over the Sacco and Vanzetti case. And he was no fan of the writer Isaac Bashevis Singer, who won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1978. He published an essay criticizing Singer as failing to reflect the humanist and social ideals that Mr. Goldberg felt were the central themes of Yiddish culture.\nHe never stopped championing Yiddish, in whatever form, even in the face of evidence that fewer and fewer people were interested in it.\n''We're dealing with a language that is about 1,000 years old and a literature that is 600 or 700 years old,'' he once said. ''What developed was an extraordinary and profound modern literature which would become the equivalent of French or German literature.''\nYiddish is a Germanic language that developed as the lingua franca of the Ashkenazic Jewry by incorporating Hebrew and borrowing liberally from the different European lands where Jews lived. The use of Yiddish has greatly diminished, with the notable exception of its use among Hasidic Jews who continue to speak the language of the European Jewish communities from which they sprang.\nMr. Goldberg was decidedly secular. But as he told an interviewer not long ago, ''Just because I'm secular doesn't mean I'm antireligious.'' What was important about Judaism, he said, was its progressive values and not its religious rituals. He pushed for more Jewish content in the Yiddish schools of his day, including more study of the Bible and of Jewish holidays, to the dismay of some of his anti-religious colleagues.\nIsaac Goldberg was born in Apt, Poland, on March 22, 1904. From early childhood everyone called him Itche, a diminutive form of Isaac. In 1920 he moved to Toronto, where he taught Yiddish at the Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring School, which promoted a socialist ideology. Later, when he moved to New York, he broke with Workmen's Circle and embraced communism, seeing the Soviet Union as the salvation for Jewish national and social problems. He became the cultural and national school director of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order, a branch of the pro-Communist International Workers Order.\nMr. Goldberg repudiated Communist ideology in the 1950s when the Stalinist regime's horrors became apparent, particularly the execution of Jewish writers in 1952.\nAlthough he was threatened with deportation because of his Communist activities, Mr. Goldberg was able to remain in the United States, and eventually became an American citizen. From 1970 to 1985, he was a professor of Yiddish language and literature at Queens College.\nTwo years ago, in honor of his 100th birthday, a group of Jewish musicians performed an adaptation of I. L. Peretz's ''Oyb Nit Nokh Hekher'' (''If Not Even Higher''), with a libretto by Mr. Goldberg. It was one of more than 20 works that he wrote with the composer Moyshe Rauch.\nIn addition to his son, who lives in Manhattan, Mr. Goldberg is survived by his wife of 67 years, the former Jennie Wilensky, who is 101; a daughter, Susan, of Manhattan; two granddaughters; and two great-grandchildren.\nMr. Goldberg fought to keep his magazine Yidishe Kultur alive right to the end of his life.\nIn an interview in 2004 he said: ''I only have two dreams. One dream is that someone will knock on the door and I will open it and they give me a check for $150,000 for the magazine. Second dream is that someone knocks at the door and I open it up and he gives me a corned beef sandwich. Those are my only two dreams. I'm not asking for much. Really, I'm not. And I think they're both reachable.''
1816135	Tillie Olsen, Feminist Writer, Dies at 94	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E4DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Tillie Olsen, whose short stories, books and essays lent a heartfelt voice to the struggles of women and working-class people, died on Monday in Oakland, Calif. She was 94.\nMs. Olsen died after being in declining health for years, her daughter Laurie Olsen said.\nA daughter of immigrants and a working mother starved for time to write, Ms. Olsen drew from her personal experiences to create a small but influential body of work. Her first published book, ''Tell Me a Riddle'' (1961), contained a short story, ''I Stand Here Ironing,'' in which the narrator painfully recounts her difficult relationship with her daughter and the frustrations of motherhood and poverty.\nAt the time of the book's publication Ms. Olsen was heralded by critics as a short story writer of immense talent. The title story was made into a film in 1980 starring Melvyn Douglas and Lila Kedrova.\nMs. Olsen returned to issues of feminism and social struggle throughout her work, publishing a nonfiction book, ''Silences,'' in 1978, an examination of the impediments that writers face because of sex, race or social class. Reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review, Margaret Atwood attributed Ms. Olsen's relatively small output to her full life as a wife and mother, a ''grueling obstacle course'' experienced by many writers.\n''It begins with an account, first drafted in 1962, of her own long, circumstantially enforced silence,'' Ms. Atwood wrote. ''She did not write for a very simple reason: A day has 24 hours. For 20 years she had no time, no energy and none of the money that would have bought both.''\nTillie Lerner was born on Jan. 14, 1912, on a tenant farm in Nebraska. She was the second of six children born to Samuel and Ida Lerner, Jewish immigrants from Russia, socialists whose political and social beliefs heavily influenced Ms. Olsen. Her father, a paperhanger and painter by trade, was the state secretary of the Nebraska Socialist Party.\nAfter completing 11th grade, Ms. Olsen dropped out of high school. She immediately took on working-class jobs, including stints as a waitress, a hotel maid, a packinghouse worker, a secretary and a factory worker.\nIt was during the Depression that Ms. Olsen began work as an activist for social and labor causes, joining the Young Communist League and organizing packinghouse workers in Kansas and Nebraska. She contracted pleurisy and tuberculosis working in a factory, and while recovering, began to write her first book, ''Yonnondio: From the Thirties.''\nIn 1933 she moved to San Francisco, where she would live for more than 70 years, and resumed her pro-labor activities. During the 1934 San Francisco general strike, she was arrested, and promptly chronicled the strike in The New Republic and The Partisan Review.\nDuring the strike she met a fellow protester named Jack Olsen, whom she later married. They reared four daughters, Karla, Julie, Kathie and Laurie. Mr. Olsen died in 1989.\nIn addition to her four daughters, Ms. Olsen is survived by a sister, Vicky Bergman, of Pembroke Pines, Fla.; eight grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.\nMs. Olsen received numerous awards, including a Ford Foundation grant in 1959, the first year it was awarded; a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1975; and a citation for Distinguished Contribution to American Literature from the American Academy and National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1976.\nBeginning in the early 1970s, she was an adviser to the Feminist Press. At her suggestion the press began reprinting feminist classics that had been lost, starting with ''Life in the Iron Mills'' by Rebecca Harding Davis. Over the years, Ms. Olsen recommended many of the books the Feminist Press reprinted.\nShe also occasionally worked as a teacher in the 1960s and '70s, at Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Massachusetts.

Organic farms and businesses, large and small, are delivering safer, more nutritious food to millions of people looking for alternatives. As demand grows, the environmental benefits of organic farming will reach a larger piece of the American landscape.\nThere are lingering tensions in the organic community over goals. Some people deeply vested in the organic movement see it as a way to heal the environment and offer consumers better food, while others hope that organic farming will preserve the family farm and expand local access to food. Both of these goals must be part of a revitalization of food and farming, and can be as long as consumers continue to see added value in the organic label.\nCharles Benbrook Enterprise, Ore.\nThe writer is the chief scientist for the Organic Center, which disseminates scientific information about organic farming and food.
1816137	The Power of Choice	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E4DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	To the Editor:\nFor the public, I think this was a significant year of awareness and information in regard to food. Hopefully this abundance of facts will encourage people to make more informed choices.\nA lot of people don't realize the power they have when it comes to their food choices. We are never neutral when we purchase. Our purchase supports that product and its existence. When people decide they no longer want to support factory farming, they are making an informed decision. They recognize that it's wrong for pigs to be kept in crates so small that they can't even turn around, so they don't buy pork; it's that simple. But if they recognize that it's wrong and still buy pork, that's where the huge disconnect is.\nI hope the integrity of this nation increases as people begin to connect the dots, and understand the value of their choices.\nRobyn Moore New York
1816138	For Boise State, Winning Respect Is the Real Trick	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE4DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	After scoring the winning 2-point conversion on a Statue of Liberty play and proposing to his girlfriend on national television, Boise State tailback Ian Johnson could have completed the storybook night by saying he was going to Disneyland.\nJohnson, however, offered a more fitting destination for where he will soon be celebrating the Broncos' pulsating 43-42 overtime victory over Oklahoma on Monday night in the Fiesta Bowl.\n''In a couple of days, I'll be back plumbing,'' Johnson said of his part-time job in Boise State.\nBreaking into college football's top echelon takes a lot of adjustment of age-old perceptions. And a blue-collar guy like Johnson, who makes $9.25 an hour working for DeBest Plumbing, may have provided the perfect moment to help Boise State join college football aristocracy.\nThe significance of Boise State's victory may ultimately be judged by where the Broncos are ranked at the start of next season. Boise State (13-0), the Western Athletic Conference champion, has gone 58-7 over the past five seasons. But for some reason, it is snubbed every preseason by pollsters and has to grind its way to the top of the rankings. The Broncos entered the game ranked No. 8, two spots higher than Oklahoma.\n''Whether it happens or not, we'll see,'' Johnson, a sophomore, said. ''But we definitely feel like, hey, now we can start a little bit higher. You can't argue with 13-0.''\nBy midafternoon Tuesday, Karl Benson, the WAC commissioner, said he was already fighting the perception that Boise State needed to resort to trickery to beat Oklahoma. Benson said that an ESPN pundit was perpetuating that notion, which Benson found infuriating.\nBoise State did use three trick plays, one at the end of regulation and two in overtime, to clinch its unforgettable victory. But Benson noted that the Broncos did not use chicanery to take a 28-10 lead over the Sooners, the Big 12 champion, in the third quarter. Benson added that running trick plays is one thing, and executing them is another.\n''People are already saying that it's a fluke,'' Benson said in a telephone interview. ''They executed those plays to perfection, not against Sacramento State on Sept. 1, but against Oklahoma on Jan. 1. Say what you want, but that takes talent. It doesn't take luck, it takes talent.''\nBenson conceded one reality that he and his league are constantly fighting.\n''The polls are heavily skewed against teams like Boise,'' he said.\nThere is strong evidence to support Benson's claim. Boise State has won the past five WAC titles and gone 39-1 in league play over that span. Yet only in one of those seasons has it earned enough respect from the pollsters to start the season in the top 25. That came in 2005 after the Broncos had an undefeated regular season in 2004.\nBoise State will lose six senior starters on offense and defense, including the star quarterback Jared Zabransky. But it does return four of five starters from a strong offensive line, and Johnson will enter the year as a favorite to win the Heisman Trophy after leading the nation in touchdowns (25).\n''One thing about Boise State is that year in and year out we play at a high level and our record is good,'' Broncos Coach Chris Petersen said. ''Maybe they'll see us play with an Oklahoma and give us some more respect out of the gate?''\nMany of the Broncos seemed to prefer keeping their status as perennial upstarts. When asked if they thought this game could propel them to a higher preseason ranking, many players implied that they would prefer that it did not. Being underappreciated underdogs has become part of the ethos of the program.\n''Boise State is Boise State because people doubt us,'' the junior offensive lineman Jeff Cavender said. ''We're a group of guys that got overlooked by the Pac-10, Big 12 and Big Ten. We get the cold shoulder, we have the doubters, and that's why we play with that chip on our shoulders. That's what makes us special.''\nBut no one could doubt that this game will long be remembered as one that closed the gap between college football's bluebloods and upstarts. Boise State played in this game only after football expanded its postseason to grant more access to teams from outside the Bowl Championship Series conferences. ''I think it will even the playing field a little bit more and shut up the people who've been doubting us,'' Boise State safety Marty Tadman said. ''I hope this game will prove that we're not just from the WAC. We proved it that we can beat big-time teams.''\nFlorida Coach Urban Meyer said his wife, Shelley, kept elbowing him to stay awake, and said she called it the ''greatest football game she ever saw.'' It was Meyer's Utah team that first crashed the B.C.S. two years ago and closed the gap between larger and smaller colleges by blowing out Pittsburgh.\n''I think that the separation of B.C.S. and non-B.C.S., I think that era is over,'' Meyer said. ''I think it is harder for some of the smaller conference schools to make it, but the B.C.S. committee and the whole process has made it easier access, which is the right thing to do.''\nFOOTBALL
1816139	Weis Has His Focus On Game, Not Giants	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E3DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Notre Dame Coach Charlie Weis tried his best Tuesday to remove his name from consideration for the not-yet-vacant Giants coaching job, saying emphatically that he was not a liar.\nWeis, who is preparing the Fighting Irish for the Sugar Bowl against Louisiana State on Wednesday night, has been the focus of speculation that he could replace Tom Coughlin as coach of the Giants. Asked if he had addressed his team about the subject, Weis insisted that he did not need to.\n''I can only say it so many times,'' said Weis, a former Giants, Jets and New England assistant now in his second year at Notre Dame. ''Every coach is perceived to be a liar.\n'' 'Well, Weis said it, but he's just a liar,' '' he said, characterizing what he believed is the conventional wisdom about coaches held by the public and members of the news media.\n''Believe it or not, there are coaches out there who aren't liars.''\nWeis said he intended to remain the coach of the Fighting Irish at least until his son, Charlie, an eighth-grader, graduates from Notre Dame, which is also Weis's alma mater.\n''Hopefully, after that, we'll have enough money to be sitting on a beach somewhere, sipping piña coladas,'' he said.\nBecause it is the bowl season, Weis and his L.S.U. counterpart, Les Miles, felt compelled to assure the Irish and Tigers faithful Tuesday that they had already attained their dream jobs. They are close to the same age -- Weis is 50, Miles 53 -- and each is in his second season as the coach at a storied football program.\nWhen the No. 11-ranked Irish (10-2) and the No. 4 Tigers (10-2) meet Wednesday, each team will be looking for validation for what it has already accomplished, as well as taking a positive step toward next season.\nAlthough Miles is settling in nicely in Baton Rouge -- he is 21-4 as the Tigers' coach -- he was drawn into the coaching merry-go-round discussion because his predecessor, Nick Saban, is weighing an offer to leave the Miami Dolphins for the University of Alabama. The Crimson Tide is reportedly offering to make Saban, who led L.S.U. to a share of the national title in the 2003 season, the highest-paid coach in college football.\nThe Tigers' offensive coordinator, Jimbo Fisher, is also a candidate for several vacancies, including the one as offensive coordinator for Bobby Bowden at Florida State.\n''L.S.U. has every possible facet that would make a family man, a coach happy,'' said Miles, who was an assistant coach for 21 years before becoming the head coach at Oklahoma State in 2001.\nWeis's spirited denial does not keep him from topping lists of potential replacements for Coughlin, whose job may be in jeopardy. The Giants (8-8) salvaged a disappointing season by defeating Washington in their season finale Saturday to earn a wild-card berth in the playoffs and a game against Philadelphia on Sunday.\nStill, Coughlin's bosses have not spoken publicly about his future with the team.\nWeis maintained that his immediate concern was leading the Fighting Irish to a victory over L.S.U. He is 19-5 as Notre Dame's coach, and he has the Irish back in a Bowl Championship Series bowl for the second year in a row.\n''Our team really needs to win this game, not just want to win this game,'' Weis said. ''It would be great for the university and everything else, but we need to win this for the guys walking out the door.''\nWeis said he expected this fondness for his players and the college game to grow the longer he stays at Notre Dame. He said what was most gratifying about his short time as a college coach was getting a group of players to bond as a team.\nIn his 15 years as an assistant coach in the N.F.L., Weis said, it was only in his last years with the Patriots -- a team that won three of four Super Bowls -- that there was that kind of camaraderie. He credited Coach Bill Belichick for pulling off that rare feat in the N.F.L.\nWeis made it clear that he believed he could do so for many years with great results at Notre Dame.\n''They were able to buy into 'it's all about the team,' '' Weis said. ''I don't know if in the N.F.L. that can be done year in and year out.''\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL

1816141	Political Paper Stolen, Giuliani Camp Says	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E2DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Advisers to former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that someone infiltrated the Giuliani camp last fall and stole a document about his presidential prospects and political liabilities. It was then leaked, they said, as a ''dirty trick'' to embarrass Mr. Giuliani and highlight such headaches as his controversial former aide, Bernard B. Kerik, and one of his ex-wives, Donna Hanover.\nThe Daily News was given the 140-page document recently by someone ''sympathetic to one of Giuliani's rivals for the White House,'' The News said in an article published yesterday. According to the article, the document proposes a $100 million fund-raising effort for 2007, names an array of potential donors, and warns that Mr. Giuliani might face ''insurmountable'' problems, including questions about Mr. Kerik and Ms. Hanover.\nMr. Giuliani is expected to decide over the next few months whether to run for president, his advisers say, and he has already formed an exploratory committee to raise money.\nA Giuliani spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said yesterday that the document belonged to a staff member and did not reflect official strategy, but ''simply someone's ideas which were committed to paper over three months ago.'' Ms. Mindel said the document was apparently stolen from a piece of luggage during a Giuliani political trip last fall, then photocopied and replaced in the luggage. Ms. Mindel said she did not know if her office would seek a criminal investigation of the alleged theft.\nThe public disclosure of the document is potentially damaging for Mr. Giuliani, not least because since 9/11, he has built a business as a private consultant on security issues while creating an image as a political leader capable of combating terrorism. Indeed, an adviser to one of his possible rivals in 2008, Senator John McCain of Arizona, half-joked yesterday that it was interesting that Mr. Giuliani's businesses included security consulting.\n''I'm surprised that something like that would ever leave the custody of a campaign, and that such raw and frank information would be around the countryside,'' said the McCain adviser, John Weaver. ''That said, a lot of the information was predictable.''\nThe document outlines a fund-raising effort to bring in at least $25 million by the end of March, and to spend more than $21 million this year. The News said it included notations that named Mr. Giuliani's chief fund-raiser, Anne Dickerson, and a senior political aide, Anthony Carbonetti; Ms. Mindel would not say to whom the document belonged.\nAmong the sections that appear outdated are the prospective donor lists. The document proposed New Jersey fund-raisers Lewis M. Eisenberg and Larry Bathgate, financier Henry R. Kravis, and FedEx executive Fred Smith. The first three men were named last month as leaders of Mr. McCain's fund-raising operation, and Mr. Smith is expected to join the roster shortly.\nAssessing the document, which includes printed text, handwriting and spreadsheets, The News drew the conclusion that Mr. Giuliani appeared torn between seeking the White House and continuing his business endeavors, which include consulting on leadership and security issues, a law practice and an investment concern.\nOne page in the document, according to The News, says Mr. Giuliani might ''drop out'' of the race as a result of ''insurmountable'' personal and political concerns.\nOn that page was a list of bullet points that seem to highlight those concerns: Mr. Giuliani's consulting practice; his former police commissioner, Mr. Kerik, who has struggled with personal and professional controversies; Ms. Hanover, with whom he had a stormy breakup; his third and current wife, Judith Nathan Giuliani; and ''social issues'' -- apparently a reference to his support for abortion rights, gay civil unions, and gun control, some or all of which are opposed by many Republican voters.\n''All will come out -- in worst light,'' the document stated. ''$100 million against us on this stuff,'' it continued, apparently a reference to likely efforts by Giuliani opponents to draw public attention to his liabilities.\nIt also suggests that Mr. Giuliani would categorize and honor his donors with terms from baseball. While President Bush referred to his best financial supporters as ''Rangers'' and ''Pioneers,'' Mr. Giuliani would call them ''Team Captains,'' ''MVPs,'' ''All-Stars,'' and ''Sluggers.'' He would focus his fund-raising operations in New York, Washington, and California, the document indicates.\nMs. Mindel called the document ''very outdated,'' but at least some of the ideas reflect current strategy discussions in the Giuliani camp, according to Republican Party figures who are familiar with the discussions and who spoke to The New York Times recently on condition of anonymity. Specifically, these Republicans say, Giuliani advisers believe that he is broadly popular enough to be able to raise money quickly for a presidential bid, and that he would need more than $100 million by the end of 2007.\nAccording to Giuliani advisers, the document was a notebook compiled by one staff member whose luggage was not immediately located after a private plane flight last fall. They said it was not an official dossier that all Giuliani political aides shared.\n''Voters are sick and tired of dirty tricks,'' Ms. Mindel said. Referring to the document, she added: ''It's about as relevant today as a grocery list written in early October -- in pencil.''
1816142	IRAQ TO EXAMINE ABUSIVE CONDUCT TOWARD HUSSEIN	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E2DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Iraq's Shiite-led government said Tuesday that it had ordered an investigation into the abusive behavior at the execution of Saddam Hussein, who was subjected to a battery of taunts by official Shiite witnesses and guards as he awaited his hanging.\nOfficials said a three-man Interior Ministry committee would look into the scenes that have caused outrage and public demonstrations among Mr. Hussein's Sunni Arab loyalists in Iraq, and widespread dismay elsewhere, especially in the Middle East. In an unofficial cellphone video recording that was broadcast around the world and posted on countless Web sites, Mr. Hussein is shown standing on the gallows platform with the noose around his neck at dawn on Saturday, facing a barrage of mockery and derision from unseen tormentors below the gallows.\nAs the shock of those scenes reached a new crescendo in Iraq, American officials said that they had worked until the last hours of Mr. Hussein's life to persuade Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to delay the execution. The officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, said they appealed to Mr. Maliki not to execute Mr. Hussein at dawn on Saturday because of the onset of a major Islamic festival, and because of constitutional and legal questions that the Americans believed threw the legitimacy of the execution into doubt.\nBut when Mr. Maliki decided to go ahead with the hanging, the Americans said they made no further attempts to stop it, having concluded that they could advise the Iraqis against the execution, but not prevent it if the Iraqis persisted, out of respect for Iraqi sovereignty.\nWhen asked if that decision had been made in the White House, the Americans refused to say, noting only that it came some time before the final exchanges on Friday night. Mr. Hussein was hanged at 6:10 a.m. on Saturday, about seven hours after what the officials said was their final attempt to postpone the hanging.\n''We told the prime minister that going forward on the first day of Id would have a negative reaction in the Islamic world, and among the Iraqi people,'' a senior American official said, recounting a telephone conversation with Mr. Maliki that began at 10:30 p.m. Baghdad time on Friday. The reference was to the Id al-Adha holiday, which began for Sunnis on Saturday, marking the end of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. ''Therefore,'' the official said, ''we said we thought it would be better if they delayed until after Id, and use the delay to resolve the legal issues.''\nThe American official said that Mr. Maliki had never fully explained his urgency in carrying out the death sentence, which was upheld last Tuesday in an appeals court ruling that set off a 30-day countdown for executions to be carried out after a final appeal has been turned down. But the prime minister gave one explanation that appeared to weigh heavily on his mind, the American said, and that was his fear that Mr. Hussein might be the subject of an insurgent attempt to free him if the procedural wrangling over the execution were protracted.\n''His concern was security, and that there was a danger that if it continued, maybe there would be a mass kidnapping to bargain for Saddam Hussein's release,'' the official said. ''He was concerned that he might somehow get free.''\nThe American decision to confirm that they had opposed the quick execution came after days of silence from the American Embassy and the United States military command in Baghdad, which appeared to have been shocked, like so many others, by the unofficial video recording that showed the bedlam at the gallows.\nWith some Iraqi politicians raising fresh demands for Mr. Maliki's dismissal, the Americans, in offering to have a senior official discuss the matter in a telephone interview with The New York Times, appeared eager to protect the Bush administration from a fresh surge of criticism for its handling of events in Iraq.\nThe official said that among American officials in Iraq who had tried to stop Mr. Maliki from rushing Mr. Hussein to the gallows, the reaction to the scenes of abuse had been one of dismay.\n''Well, yes, when I think of the behavior of the people who were there, I'm disappointed and distressed, that's true,'' the official who spoke in the telephone interview said. He said he had been one of the Americans who intervened with Mr. Maliki on Friday night and earlier last week to try to delay the hanging.\nMr. Maliki seemed equally eager to ward off the opprobrium stirred by the execution. As his aides announced that the events at the hanging would be the subject of an inquiry, one of the officials who attended the hanging, a prosecutor at the trial that condemned Mr. Hussein to death, said that one of two men he had seen holding a cellphone camera aloft to make a video of Mr. Hussein's last moments -- up to and past the point where he fell through the trapdoor -- was Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. Maliki's national security adviser. Attempts to reach Mr. Rubaie were unsuccessful. The prosecutor, Munkith al-Faroun, said the other man holding a cellphone above his head was also an official, but he could not recall his name.\nThe government inquiry was ordered as a groundswell of protest grew at Sunni population centers across Iraq. The protests, sporadic in the first 72 hours after the hanging, appeared to be building in intensity as Iraqi and American troops relaxed security cordons that had been thrown around centers of diehard support for Mr. Hussein, including his hometown, Tikrit, 100 miles north of Baghdad, and Awja, the village where he was born, a few miles away. The protesters carried portraits of Mr. Hussein, chanted his name, and fired weapons in the air.\nThousands of mourners flocked to Awja, where Mr. Hussein's body has lain in a reception hall. The body, in a plain wood coffin draped in an Iraqi flag, has become a point of pilgrimage for loyalists. Many of those reaching Awja have wept as they filed past the coffin, shouting slogans of fealty of the kind that were universal in Iraq when Mr. Hussein was the country's dictator.\n''Maliki, you coward, you are an American agent,'' cried one demonstrator in Tikrit, referring to the prime minister. ''Iran, out, out!'' another man shouted, echoing anger among Sunnis at the rise to power in Baghdad of Shiite religious groups backed by Iran, including Mr. Maliki's Dawa Party.\nAfter Mr. Maliki made it clear to the Americans in Baghdad that his decision was final, the official who discussed the events on Friday night said, American commanders were told to deliver Mr. Hussein to an execution bloc in the Kadhimiya district of northern Baghdad that Mr. Hussein's military intelligence agency used to execute countless opponents of his government. At 4 a.m., Mr. Hussein was flown by an American military helicopter from an American detention center and handed over to the Iraqis. He was hanged with only Iraqis present, in a group of about 25, including executioners and guards, according to accounts by American and Iraqi officials.\nA postponement of the execution until after the holiday would have delayed it at least until Thursday of this week. But the American officials said they had made no stipulation as to how long the delay should be, since their concern, beyond respecting the sanctity of the Id al-Adha holiday, had been that Mr. Maliki should await a formal judicial ruling resolving the legal issues before going ahead with the hanging.\nThe Americans said Mr. Maliki had agreed, as the Americans had urged, to ask the chief judge of Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council, Midhat al-Mahmoud, to issue a formal written judgment saying that the uncompleted legal procedures that concerned the Americans were not necessary to the lawfulness of the hanging. But Judge Mahmoud refused, the Americans said, and around midnight on Friday the Iraqi leader decided to go ahead with the execution, signing a decree ordering that Mr. Hussein be ''hanged by the neck until dead.''\nThe legal issues the Americans said they urged Mr. Maliki to resolve before the hanging centered on a constitutional provision requiring Iraq's three-man presidency council to affirm all executions before they are carried out. That posed a potential obstacle to the hanging because Iraq's president, Jalal Talabani, is opposed to the death penalty. One of the other members of the council, Tariq al-Hashemi, is a Sunni from a moderate party that has disavowed Mr. Hussein, but has been careful not to endorse his trial and execution.\nMr. Maliki, in pushing ahead with the hanging, relied on a provision in the statute that established the Iraqi High Tribunal, which convicted Mr. Hussein, which said that the tribunal's verdicts, once upheld by its own appeal bench, were final and not subject to presidential review. It was that conflict the Americans said they wanted resolved by a written ruling from Judge Mahmoud. ''Mr. Maliki said that Judge Mahmoud had given that opinion orally, but we said it would be better for everybody if he said it in writing,'' the American official who discussed the standoff said.\nSami al-Askari, a political adviser to Mr. Maliki who attended the hanging, said in a telephone interview that the committee would question everyone present at the execution. He said those who used their cellphones to record the event would be one focus of the inquiry. He said his own observation was that the worst sectarian taunts had come from a guard he described as a poorly educated Shiite man with a thick Arabic accent. ''It was horrible, it was terrible, it was a mistake,'' he said. ''We were supposed to sit there quietly, just looking at what's going on.''\nThe first images of the execution that were released were in the form of an official video recording without sound. The unofficial cellphone images showed Mr. Hussein, with the noose around his neck, facing shouts of ''Go to hell!'' and taunts of ''Moktada! Moktada! Moktada!'' in reference to an unruly Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr, who has become a populist hero among Shiites.\nSpeaking of those protesting the abuse of Mr. Hussein, Mr. Faroun, the prosecutor, asked, ''Where were these critics when Saddam's people were executing whole prisons full of innocent people?'' He said he had been deeply offended by the taunting of Mr. Hussein, and had tried to stop it. ''You heard my voice on the cellphone recording,'' he said. ''I was the one shouting, 'Please, no. The man is about to be executed.' ''\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ\nCorrection: January 4, 2007, Thursday A front-page article yesterday about an Iraqi government investigation of the abusive behavior at the execution of Saddam Hussein, including the unauthorized cellphone camera recording of it, misstated the account of a witness who said he saw two others there holding cellphone cameras aloft to record Mr. Hussein's final moments. While the witness, Munkith al-Faroun, a prosecutor at Mr. Hussein's trial, said both of the others were officials, he did not identify one of them as Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the national security adviser. Mr. Rubaie, who could not be reached for comment in the article, said yesterday that he had handed his cellphone to security officials an hour before the hanging and had not recorded it.
1816143	A Surprising Secret to a Long Life: Stay in School	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	James Smith, a health economist at the RAND Corporation, has heard a variety of hypotheses about what it takes to live a long life -- money, lack of stress, a loving family, lots of friends. But he has been a skeptic.\nYes, he says, it is clear that on average some groups in every society live longer than others. The rich live longer than the poor, whites live longer than blacks in the United States. Longevity, in general, is not evenly distributed in the population. But what, he asks, is cause and what is effect? And how can they be disentangled?\nHe is venturing, of course, into one of the prevailing mysteries of aging, the persistent differences seen in the life spans of large groups. In every country, there is an average life span for the nation as a whole and there are average life spans for different subsets, based on race, geography, education and even churchgoing.\nBut the questions for researchers like Dr. Smith are why? And what really matters?\nThe answers, he and others say, have been a surprise. The one social factor that researchers agree is consistently linked to longer lives in every country where it has been studied is education. It is more important than race; it obliterates any effects of income.\nYear after year, in study after study, says Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging, education ''keeps coming up.''\nAnd, health economists say, those factors that are popularly believed to be crucial -- money and health insurance, for example, pale in comparison.\nDr. Smith explains: ''Giving people more Social Security income, or less for that matter, will not really affect people's health. It is a good thing to do for other reasons but not for health.''\nHealth insurance, too, he says, ''is vastly overrated in the policy debate.''\nInstead, Dr. Smith and others say, what may make the biggest difference is keeping young people in school. A few extra years of school is associated with extra years of life and vastly improved health decades later, in old age.\nIt is not the only factor, of course.\nThere is smoking, which sharply curtails life span. There is a connection between having a network of friends and family and living a long and healthy life. And there is evidence that people with more powerful jobs and, presumably, with more control over their work lives, are healthier and longer lived.\nBut there is little dispute about the primacy of education.\n''If you were to ask me what affects health and longevity,'' says Michael Grossman, a health economist at the City University of New York, ''I would put education at the top of my list.''\nGraduate Student Finds Answer\nThe first rigorous effort to decide whether education really changes people so they live longer began in a most inauspicious way.\nIt was 1999 and a Columbia University graduate student, Adriana Lleras-Muney, was casting about for a topic for her doctoral dissertation in economics. She found an idea in a paper published in 1969. Three economists noted the correlation between education and health and gave some advice: If you want to improve health, you will get more return by investing in education than by investing in medical care.\nIt had been an inflammatory statement, Dr. Lleras-Muney says. And for good reason. It could only be true if education in and of itself caused good health.\nBut there were at least two other possibilities.\nMaybe sick children did not go to school, or dropped out early because they were ill. Or maybe education was a proxy for wealth, and it was wealth that led to health. It could be that richer parents who gave their children everything, including better nutrition, better medical care and a better education, had children who, by virtue of being wealthy, lived longer.\nHow, she asked herself, could she sort out causes and effects? It was the chicken-and-egg problem that plagues such research.\nThe answer came one day when Dr. Lleras-Muney was reading another economics paper. It indicated that about 100 years ago, different states started passing laws forcing children to go to school for longer periods. She knew what to do.\n''The idea was, when a state changed compulsory schooling from, say, six years to seven years, would the people who were forced to go to school for six years live as long as the people the next year who had to go for seven years,'' Dr. Lleras-Muney asked.\nAll she would have to do was to go back and find the laws in the different states and then use data from the census to find out how long people lived before and after the law in each state was changed.\n''I was very excited for about three seconds,'' she says. Then she realized how onerous it could be to comb through the state archives.\nBut when her analysis was finished, Dr. Lleras-Muney says, ''I was surprised, I was really surprised.'' It turned out that life expectancy at age 35 was extended by as much as one and a half years simply by going to school for one extra year.\nHer prize-winning paper appeared in Review of Economic Studies. And she ended up with a job as an assistant professor at Princeton. Now, others papers have appeared, examining the effects of changed laws on compulsory education in Sweden, Denmark, England and Wales. In every country, compelling children to spend a longer time in school led to better health.\n''You might think that forcing someone to go to school who does not want to be there may not be the same thing as going to school because you want to,'' Dr. Lleras-Muney said. ''That did not seem to be the case.''\nNot everyone was convinced.\nVictor Fuchs, a health economist at Stanford, points out that it is not clear how or why education would lead to a longer life.\nAnd, he said, there are other mysteries. For example, women increased their years of schooling more than men have in recent decades. But men are catching up with women in their life spans.\nAnd it might be expected that after a certain point, more years of school would not add to a person's life span. That, however, is not what the data shows. The education effect never wanes. But most researchers say they are swayed by Dr. Lleras-Muney's work and the studies in other countries. That, though, leaves the question of why the education effect occurs.\nDr. Lleras-Muney and others point to one plausible explanation -- as a group, less educated people are less able to plan for the future and to delay gratification. If true, that may, for example, explain the differences in smoking rates between more educated people and less educated ones.\nSmokers are at least twice as likely to die at any age as people who never smoked, says Samuel Preston, a demographer at the University of Pennsylvania. And not only are poorly educated people more likely to smoke but, he says, ''everybody knows that smoking can be deadly,'' and that includes the poorly educated.\nBut education, Dr. Smith at RAND finds, may somehow teach people to delay gratification. For example, he reported that in one large federal study of middle-aged people, those with less education were less able to think ahead.\n''Most of adherence is unpleasant,'' Dr. Smith says. ''You have to be willing to do something that is not pleasant now and you have to stay with it and think about the future.''\nHe deplores the dictums to live in the moment or to live for today. That advice, Dr. Smith says, is ''the worst thing for your health.''\nAn Observation on the Street\nIn the late 1970's, Lisa Berkman, now a professor of public policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, took at part-time job at a San Francisco health care center. It drew people from Chinatown and the city's Italian neighborhood, North Beach, as well as from the Tenderloin district, a poor area where homeless people lived on the streets and mentally ill people roamed. And she noticed something striking.\n''In Chinatown and North Beach, there were these tightly bound social networks,'' Dr. Berkman recalls. ''You saw old people with young people. In the Tenderloin, people were just sort of dumped. People were really isolated and did not have ways of figuring out how to make things work.''\nA few years later, she was haunted by that observation. She had entered graduate school and was studying Seventh-day Adventists when she began to wonder whether the standard explanation for their longer lives -- a healthy, vegetarian diet -- was enough.\n''They were at decreased risk from many, many diseases, even ones where diet was not implicated,'' Dr. Berkman says. And, she adds, ''it seemed they simply had a slower rate of aging.''\nSeventh-day Adventists, like the people in Chinatown and North Beach, had ''incredibly cohesive social networks,'' Dr. Berkman notes. Could that be the clue?\nThirty years later, studies have borne out her hunch.\nThe risks of being socially isolated are ''phenomenal,'' Dr. Berkman says, associated with twofold to fivefold increases in mortality rates. And the correlations emerged in study after study and in country after country.\nYet, Dr. Berkman adds, there was that perennial question: Did social isolation shorten lives or were people isolated because they were sick and frail and at great risk of death?\nShe knows that sometimes ill health leads to social isolation. But, Dr. Berkman says, the more she investigated, the more evidence she found that social isolation might also lead to poor health and a shorter life by, for example, increasing stress and making it harder to get assistance when ill.\nBut researchers also warn that their findings that education and, to a lesser degree, social networks, may directly affect health do not necessarily mean that other hypotheses would also hold up. The cautionary tale, health economists say, is the story of the link between health and wealth.\nOver and over again, studies show that health is linked to wealth. It even matters where a person lives.\nFor example, in a new analysis of Medicare beneficiaries, Stephanie Raymond and Kristen Bronner of Dartmouth College find that the lowest death rates are in the wealthiest places. So in San Francisco, with a per capita income of $57,496, just 4.16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries die each year. But in Tuscaloosa, Ala, whose per capita income is $24,257, the annual death rate was 5.97 percent.\nRace was not a large factor.\n''If you control for where people live, the disparities between black and white mortality rates become much smaller,'' said Jonathan Skinner, a Dartmouth health economist.\nAn obvious explanation is that wealth buys health. And it seems plausible. Poorer people, at least in the United States, are less likely to have health insurance or access to medications.\nBut Dr. Fuchs says, then why don't differences between rich and poor shrink in countries where everyone has health care?\n''All you have to do is look at the experience of countries like England that have had health insurance for more than 40 years,'' he says. ''There is no diminution in the class differentials. It's been the same in Sweden. It's true everywhere.''\nIn fact, Dr. Smith says, the wealth-health connection, at least among adults, goes in the wrong direction. It is not that lower incomes lead to poor health so much as that poor health leads to lower incomes, he found.\nA Skewing of the Numbers\nSick people tend to have modest out-of-pocket medical expenses, but often are unable to work or unable to work full time.\nThe result can be a drastic and precipitous and long-lasting drop in income. As the ranks of middle- and upper-income populations become depleted of people who are ill, there is a skewing of the data so healthy people are disproportionately richer.\nThat effect emerged when Dr. Smith analyzed data from the National Institute on Aging's National Health and Retirement Survey, a national sample of 7,600 American households with at least one person aged 51 to 61.\nIf someone developed cancer, heart disease or lung disease -- which will affect about a fifth of people aged 51 to 61 over the next eight years -- the household's income declined by an average of more than $37,000. And its assets -- its wealth -- fell by $49,000 over the ensuing eight years, even though out-of-pocket medical expenses were just $4,000.\nDr. Smith also asked whether getting richer made people healthier, an effect that could translate into a longer life. It does not, he concluded after studying the large increases in income during the stock market surge of the 1990s.\n''I find almost no role of financial anything in the onset of disease,'' Dr. Smith says. ''That's an almost throw-you-out-of-the-room thing,'' he confesses, but the data, he and other economists insist, is consistent.\nIncome, says Dr. Preston, ''is so heavily influenced by health itself.''\nMuch More Than Genes and Luck\nAs director of the National Institute on Aging, Dr. Hodes often speaks to policy makers, giving briefings on the latest scientific findings. But, he and others say, all too often there is a disconnect.\nThere are some important findings: Health and nutrition early in life, even prenatally, can affect health in middle and old age and can affect how long people live.\nFor the most part, genes have little effect on life spans. Controlling heart disease risk factors, like smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes, pays off in a more vigorous old age and a longer life. And it seems increasingly likely that education plays a major role in health and life spans.\nAnd then there is the question of what to do. It might seem logical to act now, pouring money into education or child health, for example.\nBut scientists often say they would like good evidence beforehand that a program that sounds like it would make a difference, like keeping students in school longer, really works. And if the goal is longer and healthier lives, is that the most cost-effective way to spend public money?\nThere are just so many questions remaining, says Richard Suzman, a program director at the National Institute on Aging. Even studies showing that, for many people, the die may be cast early in life, do not reveal how best to make changes.\n''We have only a vague idea of when and where early experience links to old age or when and where to intervene,'' Dr. Suzman says.\n''When it comes to changing things,'' says Dr. Skinner, the Dartmouth economist, ''we are in uncharted territory.''\nThe New Age\nThis is last of four articles looking at the science of aging.\nThe New Age\nCorrection: January 10, 2007, Wednesday A chart last Wednesday with the continuation of a front-page article about links between education and longevity misstated a correlation. People with more education are more likely -- not less -- to have had at least one alcoholic drink per month.

What would I do?''\nAnd who has not thought: ''What if someone else fell? Would I jump to the rescue?''\nWesley Autrey, a 50-year-old construction worker and Navy veteran, faced both those questions in a flashing instant yesterday, and got his answers almost as quickly.\nMr. Autrey was waiting for the downtown local at 137th Street and Broadway in Manhattan around 12:45 p.m. He was taking his two daughters, Syshe, 4, and Shuqui, 6, home before work.\nNearby, a man collapsed, his body convulsing. Mr. Autrey and two women rushed to help, he said. The man, Cameron Hollopeter, 20, managed to get up, but then stumbled to the platform edge and fell to the tracks, between the two rails.\nThe headlights of the No. 1 train appeared. ''I had to make a split decision,'' Mr. Autrey said.\nSo he made one, and leapt.\nMr. Autrey lay on Mr. Hollopeter, his heart pounding, pressing him down in a space roughly a foot deep. The train's brakes screeched, but it could not stop in time.\nFive cars rolled overhead before the train stopped, the cars passing inches from his head, smudging his blue knit cap with grease. Mr. Autrey heard onlookers' screams. ''We're O.K. down here,'' he yelled, ''but I've got two daughters up there. Let them know their father's O.K.'' He heard cries of wonder, and applause.\nPower was cut, and workers got them out. Mr. Hollopeter, a student at the New York Film Academy, was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He had only bumps and bruises, said his grandfather, Jeff Friedman. The police said it appeared that Mr. Hollopeter had suffered a seizure.\nMr. Autrey refused medical help, because, he said, nothing was wrong. He did visit Mr. Hollopeter in the hospital before heading to his night shift. ''I don't feel like I did something spectacular; I just saw someone who needed help,'' Mr. Autrey said. ''I did what I felt was right.''

According to Nielsen's preliminary estimates, which do not account for discrepancies across time zones, approximately 14 million viewers tuned in during prime-time hours to watch the game, which kicked off at 8:53 p.m. and lasted until 12:51 a.m. CBS was second for the night in total viewers, getting a boost at 9 from ''Two and a Half Men'' (12.1 million) and at 10 from ''CSI: Miami'' (12.1 million). Among adults 18 to 49, ABC appeared to edge out CBS for second place, dominating the 8 p.m. hour because of an overrun of its afternoon football coverage of the Rose Bowl. Later in the night, however, repeats of ABC's ''Supernanny'' at 9 (6.7 million) and 10 (6.9 million) ranked a distant third. NBC was fourth over all with a marathon of ''Heroes'' repeats, which drew 5.5 million viewers at 8, 5.2 million at 9 and 4.6 million at 10.\nBENJAMIN TOFF

In 2002 General Motors and the Shubert Organization, which owns the Winter Garden, entered into a multimillion-dollar sponsorship deal, under which the automaker had naming rights to the theater. Though the specifics were never released, the deal was reported at the time to be worth $1 million a year to the Shuberts. General Motors chose not to renew the agreement when it expired at the end of 2006. Robert E. Wankel, the executive vice president of the Shubert Organization, said there were no imminent plans to change the Winter Garden's name to something else. While Broadway posted record-breaking grosses for the holiday week, ''Wicked'' hit a theatrical grand slam. It posted the highest weekly grosses ever recorded for a show on Broadway. It also, according to producers, broke the record for weekly grosses on the West End in London. And Chicago. And Toronto.

1816147	Cuomo's Opening Moves Echo Spitzer's Reform Ideas	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E0DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo began his first full day in office yesterday by meeting with officials who could play a pivotal role in investigating any state corruption cases in Albany. This opening step signals that he intends to join in Gov. Eliot Spitzer's calls for major reform of the capital's political culture.\nMr. Cuomo met first with P. David Soares, the Albany County district attorney, whose investigation last year of State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi's use of public employees as chauffeurs later prompted Mr. Hevesi to resign and plead guilty to a corruption charge. The two discussed collaborating on corruption cases, which could give muscle to Mr. Soares's efforts to pursue investigations despite his skeleton staff.\nLater in the day, the attorney general sat down with David Grandeau, the executive director of the state lobbying commission, which has led several investigations of lobbyists and their work with state elected officials, including Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican leader of the State Senate.\n''Governor Spitzer laid out a vision yesterday, and part of that vision is restoring public trust and focusing on public integrity issues,'' Mr. Cuomo said, speaking after his meeting with Mr. Soares. ''It's a mandate that we spoke about jointly during the campaign, and the issue of public integrity is now a front-burner issue.''\nYesterday's meetings were intended to position Mr. Cuomo, a card-carrying member of the state's political establishment and the son of a former governor, as Mr. Spitzer's fellow crusader for reform.\nBut Mr. Cuomo's decision to emphasize public corruption issues so early represented a contrast of sorts to Mr. Spitzer, who rose to national repute during his own tenure as attorney general through his aggressive prosecutions of corporate malfeasance, rather than prosecutions of official corruption.\nAfter the Hevesi case resulted in the comptroller's guilty plea, Mr. Soares said his office was flooded with tips about wrongdoing. But his office has relatively few resources to prosecute them: just two lawyers -- one of them currently on leave -- and one investigator. Last December, as Mr. Soares was investigating Mr. Hevesi, the County Legislature eliminated the job of Mr. Soares's chief investigator.\nAppearing with Mr. Cuomo after yesterday's meeting, Mr. Soares said they discussed the possibility of having Mr. Cuomo's investigators and lawyers work more closely with Mr. Soares and his staff.\n''We are in discussions regarding collaboration and how we can share resources instead of spending more taxpayer dollars to reinvent the wheel,'' Mr. Soares said. ''There are resources that they have on the state side that we do not have here on the county side.''\nHe added that ''state lawmakers who have run afoul of the law should worry about our collaboration,'' though he hastened to add that most state legislators ''do good work, and they keep the public trust.''\nAsked whether his office would act to recover some $500,000 in state grants directed by Mr. Bruno to a for-profit technology company in which a friend of Mr. Bruno's is an investor, Mr. Cuomo said he would not discuss any specific matters that might come before his office.\n''As a general matter, money that has been misspent should be recovered,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''If the taxpayers' money was misspent, then we'll recover the money.''\nDuring their meeting, Mr. Grandeau, the head of the lobbying commission, and Mr. Cuomo chiefly discussed Project Sunlight, a proposal Mr. Cuomo made during his campaign to unify five public disclosure databases into a single, improved database maintained by his office. The five databases cover pending legislation, contributions to elected officials, lobbyist registrations, state contracts, and businesses based in the state.\n''It was something that I found very intriguing, as someone who has spent the last twelve years trying to keep track of what's going on in Albany,'' Mr. Grandeau said.\nMr. Cuomo's idea has already earned some support from some of the state's watchdog groups, which staged their own news conference yesterday to propose a set of sweeping new ethics laws. Among them were the creation of an independent ethics commission covering all state officials and employees; full and prompt disclosure of spending on legislators' pet projects, known as member items; and tighter restrictions on the use of campaign money for personal use.\n''You're not going to have good-government groups applauding incremental change'' this year, said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.

But if he was lounging around listening to the radio, she'd say: ''What do you think this is, Times Square?'' She'd never been to New York, but she knew this: Times Square was where you hung out.\nToday, and every Wednesday for the next three months, Mr. Romero, now a photographer for The New York Times, will reveal a photographic love affair with Times Square that began in 1969. That's the year he captured these troubadours playing on West 42nd Street along the south wall of what was then the Allied Chemical Building -- and is still the building where the ball drops on New Year's Eve. Their jazz and blues attracted a crowd, and a friend encouraged donations.\nToday Times Square is transformed, the pace more frantic, the asphalt harder to find beneath all the feet. In Crossroads, Mr. Romero will mix vintage photographs with more current images.\nLENS
1816149	The Neediest Cases; A Long Way to Learn How to Help Those Back in Nepal	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E0DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Growing up in Nepal, Kunsang Sherpa, 23, knew what it was like to go without. His family farmed for a living, but in the mountainous landscape they grew only enough crops to eat. They mostly went without money and without medical care.\nFor one of his brothers, Dawa, who is a year younger, it was especially hard. Dawa is hearing impaired and did not learn sign language, and there were no special schools for him to attend. He primarily communicated with his brother in a language only they understood.\nHis deafness, the result of an infection that was never treated, was seen by the traditional Buddhist community around them as a sort of karmic payback for bad deeds in a past life.\nHis brother's hardships inspired Mr. Sherpa to pursue a career in medicine.\n''That's why I feel I want to be a doctor, or a nurse,'' he said. ''So when I go back to my country, I can help.''\nIn his efforts to help his brother, Mr. Sherpa met an American couple, Matthew Brodsky, a doctor, and Irene Taylor Brodsky, a journalist, who included Dawa in a book about the deaf community in Nepal, which was published in 1997. The couple helped the Sherpa brothers enroll in schools in Katmandu, the capital. It is a full day's drive from their home in Tarkeyghyang, a region in the Himalayas that Mr. Sherpa generally refers to, in his uncertain English, as ''my place.''\nMr. Sherpa also began working with the couple and a local doctor, helping to set up traveling clinics in even the most rural areas around the country, translating for the doctors and advertising for the clinics. Mr. Sherpa even helped Dr. Brodsky bring a clinic to ''his place,'' getting hundreds of patients to come.\nHis ability to help organize the clinic still impresses Ms. Brodsky, as does Mr. Sherpa's desire to become a doctor and his constant striving toward that goal. ''Kunsang realizes he is surrounded by people who have more obstacles than he does,'' she said. ''He realizes there is nothing standing in his way.''\nBut his association with Americans ultimately put him in danger. In Nepal, Western tourists and workers can be the targets of those seeking money, even dangerous groups who will do whatever they can to get it. Mr. Sherpa became a target as well, and was threatened and ultimately beaten after he refused to help a group of men that approached him several times, asking for money.\nAfter he was attacked, in 2004, Mr. Sherpa decided that it was too dangerous for him to stay and that he should come to the United States. With help from the Brodskys, he applied for a travel visa, Ms. Brodsky bought him a plane ticket and he arrived in August of that year. For six months, he lived with the Brodskys in Oregon. With legal help and support from the Brodskys, he applied for political asylum.\nThough he enjoyed living there, Mr. Sherpa decided to come to New York, which has a larger Nepalese community. But he could not work until he was granted political asylum, and that occurred in June.\nOnce it was granted, he realized he would need assistance in finding a job that could cover his expenses, including his $300 a month rent in the two-bedroom apartment in Queens he shares with three roommates. Information from the immigration office led him to Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of seven beneficiaries of the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. He enrolled in its employment and training program.\nHe found a job for $11 an hour in the mailroom of a law firm in Manhattan and started work on Dec. 4.\nHe is in charge of sorting and handing out an entire floor's mail, a job he performs alone.\nAnd alone is how Mr. Sherpa sometimes feels in New York City in general, despite the big apartment buildings and the crowded trains. His mother died a few months ago, and now he worries about his father and brother.\n''In my country, you know everyone. But here, you don't know who lives next door,'' he said. ''If you want to share your feelings, everyone is busy.''\nIn addition to his job, Mr. Sherpa will enroll in a certified nursing assistant's program, the first step for a career in medicine. Catholic Charities drew on $995 from the fund for the program, which will begin in the spring. In the meantime, Mr. Sherpa volunteers at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens.\nHe is grateful for the help he has received, and, in keeping with his Buddhist beliefs, it reaffirms his commitment to someday giving back.\n''If you want to have a good thing in the next life, you have to do good in this life,'' he said. After he works hard to improve his status, financially and otherwise, he said, ''I can help other people. That's how it works. It's a good thing.''\nPreviously recorded: $3,803,895.99 Recorded Friday: 710,042.30 Total: $4,513,938.29 Last year to date: $4,641,858.36\nHOW TO HELP\nChecks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245, or any of these organizations:\nBROOKLYN BUREAU OF COMMUNITY SERVICE 285 Schermerhorn Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES, DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS 191 Joralemon Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK 1011 First Avenue New York, N.Y. 10022\nCHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nFEDERATION OF PROTESTANT WELFARE AGENCIES 281 Park Avenue South New York, N.Y. 10010\nUJA-FEDERATION OF NEW YORK Church Street Station P.O.

1816150	Spitzer Speech Will Urge Fiscal Restraint	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E0DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Gov. Eliot Spitzer will call for the state government to ''rein in spending,'' cut property taxes and overhaul the workers' compensation system in his first address to state lawmakers on Wednesday.\nHis speech, or at least excerpts that his staff released on Tuesday, focused more on the economy than the inaugural speech he delivered on Monday, which more generally addressed the need for a ''new brand of politics'' in a state government mired in gridlock and scandal.\nAccording to the excerpts, Mr. Spitzer plans to issue a call ''to rein in spending and exhibit fiscal restraint'' to better afford ''long-term investments for our future.''\n''We must reverse the decline of our upstate economy, sustain the economic expansion downstate and develop new ways for those communities which have been left behind to share in the prosperity,'' according to the prepared remarks.\nThe speech will open a new legislative session. Among the other events of the day, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, is expected to be re-elected temporary president of the Senate, despite a federal investigation of his outside business activities. Mr. Bruno is the state's most powerful Republican and will be a counterweight to the governor.\nAfter a closed-door meeting on Tuesday with other Republican senators, Mr. Bruno said the investigation did not come up.\n''We're not talking about that,'' he said. ''The people are pretty well informed as to what is going on, and, again, there isn't anything that we have been accused of, so were staying focused on our agenda.''\nThe only public dissenter among Senate Republicans, Senator John J. Bonacic, said he intended to vote against Mr. Bruno but conceded he did not know of any other senator who would do the same.\n''As I see it, if our majority leader bleeds, the conference bleeds,'' he said.\nMr. Spitzer's staff also said on Tuesday that officials in his administration would prepare an annual report on the upstate region to be issued on the day the governor delivers his annual addresses to the Legislature. They also reiterated many of the proposals they made during the campaign aimed at reviving the upstate region including expediting infrastructure projects like a new Peace Bridge, which connects Western New York and Canada, and ensuring that upstate towns have high-speed Internet access.\nHis plan to cut property taxes will also be felt upstate. His first budget, due on Feb. 1, will include ''the first installment'' of the three-year, $6 billion property tax cut plan he laid out during his campaign. That plan includes a $1.5 billion property tax cut for the fiscal year beginning in April, a cut specifically aimed at the middle class.\n''The fundamental problem with the current system is that it doesn't care whether or not a person can afford to pay their property taxes,'' Mr. Spitzer said in the speech excerpts. ''Thus, the millionaire gets the same tax cut as the middle-class homeowner. I hope together we can fix this flaw.''\nThe prepared remarks have Mr. Spitzer saying, ''Property tax cuts and increased support for education must be considered in tandem,'' a nod to the Republican-controlled Senate on property taxes and to the Democratic-led Assembly on education.\nIn a sign of his desire to improve the business climate upstate, Mr. Spitzer will call for an overhaul of the workers' compensation system, which he also made a priority during his campaign. Unlike many states, New York does not limit how long injured workers can receive payments for certain kinds of injuries, including head and back injuries.\nExecutives like Robert S. Miller, the chairman and chief executive of the auto supply giant Delphi, have criticized the state for high costs related to workers' compensation. On the other hand, unions do not like the system either, because the maximum weekly payment of $400 has not been raised in recent years.\nIn his prepared remarks, Mr. Spitzer calls workers' compensation ''a system that does not work for anyone, not the employers who pay some of the highest premiums in the country and not the workers who receive some of the lowest benefits.''\nHe said that the government must reduce costs that are too high for businesses and citizens -- the ''perfect storm of unaffordability.''\nAnd as he did in his inaugural speech, he plans to lay blame at the feet of his predecessor, George E. Pataki, and perhaps to some extent at the other two men who have run the state for more than a decade, Mr. Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat.\n''We are operating in a deficit environment inherited from a culture that failed to make hard choices,'' the remarks quote him as saying. ''We're in this position because of a lack of leadership.''
1816151	Police Call Woman's Death Murder for Hire	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E0DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	A man accused of fatally shooting the owner of a beauty salon here had been hired by a companion she was trying to break up with, the police said on Tuesday.\nThe companion, Patrick Bowie, 45, of Middletown, tried to kill himself before he was arrested, the police said.\nMr. Bowie and the man accused of pulling the trigger, Melvin Green, 35, of the Bronx, were charged in the murder of Fermina Nunez, 36, who was shot in the back of the head late Saturday at the salon, said Lt. Paul Rickard of the Middletown Police Department.\nMr. Bowie, who had had an off-and-on relationship for seven years with Ms. Nunez, a mother of four, hired Mr. Green to go to the salon, on Wickham Avenue, and kill her, Lieutenant Rickard said. He would not say how much money was involved.\n''There was no other factor involved other than she was trying to get out of a relationship,'' Mr. Rickard said.\nAs detectives waited for a search warrant outside Mr. Bowie's house on Tuesday morning, he stabbed himself in the neck and groin and slit a wrist with a kitchen knife, the police said. He then walked outside and surrendered.\nHe was taken to Orange Regional Medical Center in Middletown, where he was arraigned on a charge of first-degree murder, Lieutenant Rickard said. He was then taken to the Westchester County Medical Center, where he was listed in serious condition.\nMr. Green, who the police said had been a friend of Mr. Bowie's for 20 years, was taken into custody in the Bronx on Monday night and brought to Middletown for questioning. While he was being driven to Orange County, Middletown detectives, along with the New York State and New York City police, searched his apartment and found a gun, Lieutenant Rickard said. Mr. Green was charged with first-degree murder and robbery and was being held at the Orange County Jail without bail, the authorities said.\nAccording to the police, Mr. Green entered the Final Touch by Fermina beauty salon just before midnight on Saturday as Ms. Nunez was doing the hair of three customers who were getting ready for New Year's. He forced the women to lie face down and demanded that Ms. Nunez tell him how to open the cash register. When he could not do it himself, Ms. Nunez opened the register for him. He then shot her in the head, taking money from the register before he fled, Lieutenant Rickard said.\nDetectives think Mr. Bowie was outside the shop at the time of the killing, Lt. Patrick Freeman of the Middletown police said.\nThe police said they began investigating Mr. Bowie because of his relationship with Ms. Nunez. There were several occasions in which the police were called to their homes, though no arrests were made, Lieutenant Rickard said. The inquiry led to Mr. Green, who matched the description of the gunman given by a witness, the police said.\nThough the gunman demanded money, Lieutenant Rickard said, detectives suspected that robbery was not the motive because there were gas stations in the area that would have had more cash and because the killer seemed to know that Ms. Nunez was working late.\n''We knew right off the bat the robbery was unusual and something else was going on,'' he added.\nBoth Mr. Bowie and Mr. Green have criminal records. Mr. Bowie was convicted of grand larceny in New York City in 1995. Mr. Green served three years in a New York State prison in the mid-1990s on a weapons conviction. He was also convicted of robbery and possession of a loaded firearm in New York in 1991, said Sgt. Jerry Mishk, a detective in the Middletown Police Department.\nOutside Ms. Nunez's salon, a woman who identified herself as a relative of Ms. Nunez's said that Ms. Nunez had spoken of being stalked by Mr. Bowie.
1816152	PANEL SEEKS END TO DEATH PENALTY FOR NEW JERSEY	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E0DB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	A legislative commission recommended on Tuesday that New Jersey become the first state to abolish the death penalty since states began reinstating their capital punishment laws 35 years ago. Its report found ''no compelling evidence'' that capital punishment serves a legitimate purpose, and increasing evidence that it ''is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency.''\nThe report, whose lone dissenter was the original author of the state's modern death penalty statute, came a year after New Jersey joined Illinois and Maryland in imposing moratoriums on executions, and amid growing unease among politicians and the public about capital punishment.\nEight other states, including New York, have also suspended executions in recent years, most because of court decisions. Maryland had lifted its moratorium in 2003, after a year, but a court essentially reinstated it last month.\nDeath penalty experts said that New Jersey was the first state to receive an official recommendation that capital punishment be abandoned, and it lands in a state where legislators have a Democratic majority along with a Democratic governor who supports repeal of the statute.\nThe governor, Jon S. Corzine, embraced the report on Tuesday. ''As someone who has long opposed the death penalty,'' he said in a statement, ''I look forward to working with the Legislature'' to carry out the recommendations.\nThere is ample opposition to capital punishment in both houses of the Legislature, and Senate President Richard J. Codey said in an interview that he expected to ask for a vote, although he would not discuss a timetable.\nAssembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts, who also said he supported an end to the death penalty, issued a written statement saying that he would not consider scheduling a vote until discussing the report with other Democrats, leaving the possibility that repeal legislation could remain locked in committee.\nNew Jersey's last execution was in 1963, and its death row population has shrunk to nine men. Many appeals have been extended for years by a process known as ''proportionality review,'' meant to assure that capital sentencing was not being arbitrarily applied, before the State Supreme Court.\nThe 13-member New Jersey Death Penalty Study Commission, including two prosecutors, a police chief, clergy members and murder victims' representatives, began meeting in June and heard from scores of witnesses at five public hearings before issuing the 127-page report.\n''Based on our findings, the commission recommends that the death penalty in New Jersey be abolished and replaced with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, to be served in a maximum security facility,'' the report said. ''The commission also recommends that any cost savings resulting from the abolition of the death penalty be used for benefits and services for survivors of victims of homicide.''\nIf the Legislature did abolish the death penalty, it would be the first to do so since the United States Supreme Court halted all executions in 1972 -- after which 38 states rewrote their laws to reinstate the practice. New Jersey restored the death penalty in 1982.\nBut a repeal would be in line with a nationwide retreat from executions, with the annual count declining by nearly half since 1999. A nationwide Gallup telephone poll in 2006 found Americans almost evenly divided when asked whether a death sentence or life without the possibility of parole was a preferable punishment for murder, after years of previous polls in which a majority supported the death penalty.\n''We're in a period of national reconsideration of the death penalty,'' said Austin D. Sarat, a professor of political science and law at Amherst College in Massachusetts. ''I believe what's happening in New Jersey will have a tremendously galvanizing effect.''\nRichard C. Dieter, the director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, attributed the sea change to the many wrongful convictions exposed by DNA evidence. ''That is the wedge that has made the death penalty difficult to fix,'' Mr. Dieter said. ''It's all related to the scientific revolution we've had in the last 10 years.''\nProfessor Sarat, the author of the 2001 book, ''When the State Kills,'' said the shift in public opinion had accelerated even in the last few months.\nTwo weeks ago, a botched execution in Florida underscored doubts about lethal injection and led Gov. Jeb Bush to suspend the death penalty. The same day, a federal court ruled that California's lethal injection procedures violated the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\n''If you'd asked me six months ago if they'd end up in this place, I'd have said no,'' Professor Sarat said of the New Jersey commission. ''I would have said they'd take a more careful route.''\nNew York, which has only one man on death row and has not carried out an execution since reinstating the death penalty, has had a moratorium since the state's Court of Appeals found its law unconstitutional in 2004. The Legislature has not moved to revise the statute.\nIn New Jersey, a bill to repeal the death penalty was introduced several years ago but never brought to a vote in the judiciary committee of either chamber. But Mr. Codey, the Senate president, said on Tuesday, ''I think that will be done.''\n''What's the use of having a death penalty if at the age of 18 you commit a murder and then have to live longer than Methuselah to be executed?'' he asked.\nMr. Codey also pointed to the change in public opinion since the enactment of the death penalty law, as did the commission. The panel cited a 1999 Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll in which 44 percent of New Jersey residents supported the death penalty and 37 percent preferred life imprisonment without parole, and a 2002 poll that asked the same question found that 36 percent supported the death penalty and 48 percent favored life without parole.\nThe commission's report, which recommended the life-without-parole alternative, drew stinging responses from several Republicans. ''How can they possibly arrive at that conclusion when New Jersey has not enforced the current law even once since its enactment?'' the Assembly's minority leader, Alex DeCroce, who represents Morris and Passaic Counties, asked in a written statement.\nThe dissenter on the commission, John F. Russo, a former State Senate president from Ocean County and a Democrat, said the problem was not in the law but in ''the liberal judges and other individuals who have consistently disregarded the legislative will and refused to enforce the law as written.''\nMr. Russo, a former prosecutor, recounted a death penalty verdict that he had fought for but left him in tears. ''I realize the gravity of the issue,'' he said, adding that he believed the death penalty should still be available in cases of serial killings and terrorism.
1816153	Bush Says Plan Would Balance Budget by '12	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EFDB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	President Bush said on Tuesday that he would propose a plan that he insists would, if followed, achieve a balanced budget by 2012, the most optimistic he has been in at least five years, and he said the goal could be achieved without rescinding any of his big tax cuts.\nIn an op-ed article for the Wednesday issue of the The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Bush said his budget proposal for the 2008 fiscal year would for the first time project a deficit that disappears.\n''The bottom line is tax relief and spending restraint are good for the American worker, good for the American taxpayer, and good for the federal budget,'' Mr. Bush said in the article, which was online Tuesday night. ''Now is not the time to raise taxes on the American people.''\nMr. Bush offered no specifics on how he intends to achieve a balanced budget, beyond declaring that his tax cuts had led to economic growth and generated large increases in tax revenue for the past two years.\nThe White House's most recent budget forecast, issued last summer, called for the deficit to decline to $127 billion in 2011 from its peak of $412 billion in 2004. Thanks to larger-than-expected revenue gains last year, the shortfall for 2006 declined to $248 billion.\nDuring his re-election campaign in 2004, Mr. Bush promised to cut the deficit in half by 2009. Though the prediction was greeted with widespread skepticism, that goal now looks increasingly plausible even if war costs in Iraq continue at current levels for another year.\nMr. Bush gave no hint in the article about whether the goal of a balanced budget by 2012 was predicated on continued rapid growth in tax revenues or deep new spending cuts in domestic programs.\nBut Mr. Bush's budget plans in the past several years have consistently failed to take into account two major costs in the years ahead: the war in Iraq and the cost of restraining or repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax.\nWar costs are now more than $100 billion a year, and Mr. Bush is expected to ask Congress for a supplemental spending package of more than $110 billion to finance military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan over the next year.\nThe alternative minimum tax is a potentially more costly item. The tax, which was created to prevent rich taxpayers from making too much use of elaborate deductions, is rapidly expanding its reach into the middle class because it is not adjusted for inflation.\nMr. Bush and Democratic leaders have called for a permanent ''fix'' to the alternative minimum tax, but an outright repeal would cost about $1 trillion over the next 10 years. For the past several years, Mr. Bush and the Congress have kept the tax from expanding by passing a series of one-year measures that could cost more than $70 billion for next year alone.
1816154	Teddy Kollek Dies at 95; Led Jerusalem	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402EFDB1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Teddy Kollek, who as mayor of Jerusalem for nearly three decades did more to build and develop the city as Israel's capital than any other figure while promoting coexistence with a sometimes hostile Arab population, died Tuesday in Jerusalem. He was 95.\nThe Jerusalem Foundation, the fund-raising organization he established, announced his death.\nMr. Kollek, a former aide to David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founding prime minister, became mayor of small, Jewish West Jerusalem in 1965 and nearly resigned after a difficult first year. But after Israel conquered the city's eastern sector in the 1967 war, he threw himself into the project of a reunited Jerusalem and was re-elected five times before losing in 1993, at age 82, to Ehud Olmert, now the prime minister.\nMr. Olmert always chafed at Mr. Kollek's reputation as an indefatigable fund-raiser, institution builder and preacher of coexistence, but he praised him on Tuesday, saying, ''His name will always be an inseparable part of Jerusalem's glory.''\nThe late Yitzhak Rabin called him the greatest builder of Jerusalem since Herod the Great. Mr. Kollek was a founder of significant markers of the modern city and state: the Israel Museum, the Jerusalem Foundation, the Jerusalem Theater, the Cinemathèque, the Kahn Theater and other cultural institutions.\nUri Lupolianski, the current mayor, said Tuesday, ''Teddy was Jerusalem and Jerusalem was Teddy.'' It was a high compliment from a leader of the city's ultra-Orthodox community, with whom Mr. Kollek sometimes fought.\nMr. Kollek was a man of will, charm and energy who loved being a friend of the rich and the famous, including Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra. He tapped many of them for money for his beloved city.\nHe was above all a Labor Zionist who set about trying to unite the two halves of Jerusalem the best he could. ''He'd say, 'I'd love the city to be empty of Arabs, but since they are here we need to serve them, because if we treat them badly they will hate us more,''' said Tom Segev, an Israeli historian who ran Mr. Kollek's office for two years in the late 1970s.\nWithin hours of the takeover of East Jerusalem, Mr. Kollek went to the military commander and demanded milk for Arab children. ''He was the symbol of the unification of Jerusalem, and he was considered pro-Arab,'' Mr. Segev said. ''But he was simply pragmatic.''\nMr. Kollek felt he should have done more for Arab residents, said Yisrael Kimche, an urban planner. ''He himself said he did not do enough for East Jerusalem,'' Mr. Kimche said. ''He did not bring equality in city services between east and west. He tried, but not hard enough.''\nIn 1967, Mr. Kimche said, ''the gap between east and west was vast.''\n''Three times a week there would be running water in the east,'' he said. ''Many neighborhoods there did not have sewage or phone lines. Eventually needs were mostly met, but there was never a budget large enough to cope.''\nMeron Benvenisti, who worked closely with him, said Mr. Kollek saw Jerusalem ''in terms of Vienna, a mosaic of different cultures where the tension is benign, invigorating, not threatening to destroy the city.'' But what Mr. Kollek called heterogeneous, others, like Mr. Benvenisti, called dangerously polarized.\nIsrael's annexation of East Jerusalem has not been recognized internationally, and the 190,000 Jews who moved into it are considered illegal settlers by much of the world. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.\nIn his 28 years as mayor Mr. Kollek worked 18-hour days, prowling the city and keeping his home phone number in the public directory. He would often return home to a pile of messages taken by his wife, Tamar. Sometimes he would return the calls, even at 3 a.m., telling people that he would get their problems fixed.\nAfter 1993 he devoted much of his time to the Israel Museum and to the Jerusalem Foundation, which he set up in 1966 to raise millions of dollars in private financing for city projects, including parks, sports facilities and the restoration of archaeological treasures.\n''He really forged the landscape of modern Jerusalem as we know it, and he saw the museum as the jewel in that landscape,'' said James Snyder, the museum's director. ''The idea of this modernist museum complex on the crest of Jerusalem was his.''\nMr. Kollek will be buried Thursday in a state funeral in a section of Mount Herzl Cemetery here reserved for Israel's leaders.\nHe was born Theodor Herzl Kollek on May 27, 1911, in a small village near Budapest and named after the Viennese founder of the Zionist movement. He grew up in Vienna, where his father was a director of the Rothschild bank.\n''I came from a multiracial society,'' Mr. Kollek once recalled in an interview.\nBy the age of 11 he was already a Zionist, and as the Nazis came to power he organized an underground to smuggle refugees into Palestine. He emigrated to Palestine in 1935 and helped found the Ein Gev kibbutz. That first year he contracted typhoid five times and suffered several bouts of malaria.\nStill, he remembered life at Ein Gev as paradise. ''We came to an empty land, we started growing trees, fishing on the Galilee,'' he said. ''You saw your dreams materialize.''\nIn 1937 he married Tamar Schwartz, whom he had met in Vienna. They had two children, Amos, a filmmaker, and Osnat, an artist. His wife and children survive him, as do five grandchildren.\nMr. Kollek was sent to England in 1938 to work with a Zionist youth movement, but he spent most of his energy getting Jews out of Nazi-occupied countries. In 1939 he went to Vienna carrying British entry permits for Austrian Jews. There he met a Nazi who seemed like a minor clerk, and after 15 minutes the official agreed to release 3,000 Jewish children from concentration camps.\nMr. Kollek said he never saw the man again until 1961, when the ''clerk'' was brought to Israel to face the charge of crimes against humanity. It was Adolf Eichmann.\nIn England, Mr. Kollek met Ben-Gurion, who became his mentor. During World War II, Mr. Kollek said, it became clear that ''a country of our own was an absolute necessity to save the Jewish people from extermination.''\nHe made frequent trips to Cairo, where he met Jewish soldiers serving in the British Army and used his connections to smuggle British arms to Palestine, then under the control of Britain. He was later criticized for giving the British the names of 1,000 members of the Jewish underground whose terrorist tactics were meant to force the British out.\n''I'm proud of it,'' he said later. ''I'd do it again. The Jewish Agency, our government at the time, was respectable and on the way to becoming a state. We had one large defense organization, the Haganah.\n''There were splinter groups -- Stern, Irgun -- who killed, blew up the King David, hanged British sergeants,'' he added, referring to the Jerusalem hotel.\nAfter World War II, Mr. Kollek was sent to New York, where he worked partly out of a telephone booth and partly out of an office over the Copacabana nightclub to arm the Jewish state-to-be for an expected invasion by Arabs.\nAs Israel neared statehood in May 1948, he helped smuggle weapons. In one day he raised a million dollars in Mexico City to buy airplanes. When Israel became independent, he headed the American desk in the Foreign Ministry, then went to Washington as minister in the Israeli Embassy.\nMr. Kollek was a founder of the modern Israeli foreign intelligence service. Throughout the 1950s he was a liaison between Israel and the fledgling Central Intelligence Agency. In 1956 he helped the C.I.A. obtain a copy of a secret speech that changed the course of the cold war. It was a denunciation of the Soviet leader Stalin, then dead three years, by his successor, Nikita S. Khrushchev.\nA copy of the speech went from Poland to Israel to the director of central intelligence, Allen W. Dulles, who gave it to his brother, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who leaked it to The New York Times. It was the first sign that Stalin's reign of terror might be over.\nIn 1952 Ben-Gurion summoned Mr. Kollek to Jerusalem to become director general of the prime minister's office. In 12 years Mr. Kollek became involved in everything from broadcasting to the Dead Sea Scrolls, from aid programs to desalination.\nWhen Ben-Gurion left office, Mr. Kollek transferred his energies to the Israel Museum. He had nursed the idea from the early 1950s, when most of Israel's leaders considered a museum of art a luxury the young state could not afford. But he argued that if Israel needed to absorb immigrants and build its military power, ''it also needs expressions of culture and civilization.''\nBen-Gurion, then in retirement, urged his protégé to seek the mayor's office in Jerusalem. His son offered no encouragement. ''What will happen if you win?'' he asked. ''You'll be in charge of the garbage?''\nWhen a coalition on the city council elected him mayor in 1965, he went to Jerusalem's best tailor and ordered smart olive-green uniforms for the sanitation inspectors.\n''I got into this by accident,'' he said. ''I was bored. When the city was united I saw this as a historic occasion. To take care of it and show better care than anyone else ever has is a full life purpose. I think Jerusalem is the one essential element in Jewish history. A body can live without an arm or a leg, not without the heart. This is the heart and soul of it.''\nMr. Kollek never spoke perfect Hebrew -- or perfect German or perfect English -- Mr. Segev remembered. ''In some ways he remained an alien,'' Mr. Segev said. ''But Israel is a colorful mosaic, and there was also a place for a stone called Teddy Kollek.''\nCorrection: January 11, 2007, Thursday An obituary on Jan. 3 about Teddy Kollek, the former mayor of Jerusalem, incorrectly rendered his birth name. He was Theodor Kollek, not Theodor Herzl Kollek. (Although he was named after Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, he was not given a middle name, according to the Jerusalem Foundation, which he founded.)

1816168	Google Answer To Filling Jobs Is an Algorithm	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E7DA1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Have you ever made a profit from a catering business or dog walking? Do you prefer to work alone or in groups? Have you ever set a world record in anything?\nThe right answers could help get you a job at Google.\nGoogle has always wanted to hire people with straight-A report cards and double 800s on their SATs. Now, like an Ivy League school, it is starting to look for more well-rounded candidates, like those who have published books or started their own clubs.\nDesperate to hire more engineers and sales representatives to staff its rapidly growing search and advertising business, Google -- in typical eccentric fashion -- has created an automated way to search for talent among the more than 100,000 job applications it receives each month. It is starting to ask job applicants to fill out an elaborate online survey that explores their attitudes, behavior, personality and biographical details going back to high school.\nThe questions range from the age when applicants first got excited about computers to whether they have ever tutored or ever established a nonprofit organization.\nThe answers are fed into a series of formulas created by Google's mathematicians that calculate a score -- from zero to 100 -- meant to predict how well a person will fit into its chaotic and competitive culture.\n''As we get bigger, we find it harder and harder to find enough people,'' said Laszlo Bock, Google's vice president for people operations. ''With traditional hiring methods, we were worried we will overlook some of the best candidates.''\nGoogle is certainly not alone in the search for quantitative ways to find good employees. Employers use a wide range of tests meant to assess skills, intelligence, personality and honesty. And the use of biographical surveys similar to Google's new system is on the rise.\nSuch tools, however, have mainly been the trademark of large corporations recruiting armies of similar workers, like telephone service representatives or insurance sales agents. They are rarely used in Silicon Valley, which is built on a belief in idiosyncratic talent.\n''Yahoo does not use tests, puzzles or tricks, etc., when interviewing candidates,'' Jessie Wixon, a spokeswoman for Yahoo, said. (Google is known for hazing prospects in interviews with intractable brain teasers. And it once tried to attract candidates by placing some particularly difficult problems on billboards.)\nGoogle's growth is staggering even by Silicon Valley standards. It is constantly leasing new buildings for its overflowing campus here and opening offices around the world.\nGoogle has doubled the number of employees in each of the last three years. Even though the company now has about 10,000 employees, Mr. Bock says he sees no reason the company will not double again in size this year. That would increase the number of hires to about 200 a week.\nAs a result, Mr. Bock, who joined Google from General Electric last spring, has been trying to make the company's rigorous screening process more efficient. Until now, head hunters said, Google largely turned up its nose at engineers who had less than a 3.7 grade-point average. (Those who wanted to sell ads could get by with a 3.0 average, head hunters said.) And it often would take two months to consider candidates, submitting them to more than half a dozen interviews.\nUnfortunately, most of the academic research suggests that the factors Google has put the most weight on -- grades and interviews -- are not an especially reliable way of hiring good people.\n''Interviews are a terrible predictor of performance,'' Mr. Bock said.\nMr. Bock said that he wanted the company's human resources department to bring the iconoclastic style as its Web site developers to the normally routine function of interviewing job candidates. ''The level of questioning assumptions is uniquely Googly,'' Mr. Bock said.\nSo Google set out to find out if there were any bits of life experience or personality it could use to spot future stars.\nLast summer, Google asked every employee who had been working at the company for at least five months to fill out a 300-question survey.\nSome questions were factual: What programming languages are you familiar with? What Internet mailing lists do you subscribe to?\nSome looked for behavior: Is your work space messy or neat?\nAnd some looked at personality: Are you an extrovert or an introvert?\nAnd some fell into no traditional category in the human resources world: What magazines do you subscribe to? What pets do you have?\n''We wanted to cast a very wide net,'' Mr. Bock said. ''It is not unusual to walk the halls here and bump into dogs. Maybe people who own dogs have some personality trait that is useful.''\nThe data from this initial survey was then compared with 25 separate measures of each employee's performance. Again there were traditional yardsticks -- the employee's reviews, both by supervisors and peers, and their compensation -- and some oddball ones.\nOne score was what the company called ''organizational citizenship,'' said Todd Carlisle, an analyst with a doctorate in organizational psychology, who designed the survey. That is, ''things you do that aren't technically part of your job but make Google a better place to work,'' Dr. Carlisle said, such as helping interview job candidates.\nWhen all this was completed, Dr. Carlisle set about analyzing the two million data points the survey collected. Among the first results was confirmation that Google's obsession with academic performance was not always correlated with success at the company.\n''Sometimes too much schooling will be a detriment to you in your job,'' Dr. Carlisle said, adding that not all of the more than 600 people with doctorates at Google are equally well suited to their current assignments.\nIndeed, there was no single factor that seemed to find the top workers for every single job title. (And pet ownership did not seem to be a useful predictor of anything.) But Dr. Carlisle was able to create several surveys that he believed would help find candidates in several areas -- engineering, sales, finance, and human resources. Currently about 15 percent of applicants take the survey; it will be used for all applicants starting this month.\nEven as Google tries to hire more people faster, it wants to make sure that its employees will fit into its freewheeling culture. The company boasts that only 4 percent of its work force leaves each year, less than other Silicon Valley companies. And it works hard to retain people, with copious free food, time to work on personal projects and other goodies. Stock options and grants certainly encourage employees to stay long enough to take advantage of the company's surging share price.\nGoogle's hiring approach is backed by academic research showing that quantitative information on a person's background -- called ''biodata'' among testing experts -- is indeed a valid way to look for good workers.\nMichael Mumford, a psychology professor at the University of Oklahoma who specializes in talent assessment, said that this sort of test was effective, but he cautioned that companies should not rely on oddball factors, even if they seemed to correlate to good performance.\n''You have to know or at least have a hypothesis why having a dog makes a good computer programmer,'' Professor Mumford said. ''If you ask whether someone started a club in high school, it is a clear indicator of leadership.''\nAt Google, it is too early to tell if the system is working. The surveys have been in use in about a dozen areas for several months.\nIndeed, there is some resistance even at Google to the idea that a machine can pick talent better than a human.\n''It's like telling someone that you have the perfect data about who they should marry,'' Dr. Carlisle said.\nBut even before the results are in on the new survey, Mr. Bock says he is already seeing success in easing the company past its obsession with grades.\n''More and more in the time I've been here, we hire people based on experience as a proxy for what they can accomplish,'' he said. ''Last week we hired six people who had below a 3.0 G.P.A.''\nCorrection: January 5, 2007, Friday A picture caption on Wednesday with the continuation of a front-page article about the hiring practices of Google reversed the names of the two employees looking over a job application. Laszlo Bock, a Google vice president, was at right; Todd Carlisle, an analyst at the company, was at left.
1816169	Trying to Find Solutions in Chaotic Middle Schools	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E7DA1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Sit in with a seventh-grade science class at Seth Low, a cavernous Brooklyn middle school, as paper balls fly and pens are flicked from desk to desk.\nA girl is caught with a note and quickly tears it up, blushing, as her classmates chant, ''Read it!'' The teacher, Laura Lowrie, tries to demonstrate simple machines by pulling from a box a hammer, a pencil sharpener and then, to her instant remorse, a nutcracker -- the sight of which sends a cluster of boys into a fit of giggles and anatomical jokes.\n''It's the roughest, toughest, hardest thing to teach,'' Ms. Lowrie said of middle school. ''I'll go home and feel disappointed with what's going on and I'll try a different tactic the next day.'' As for the nutcracker, she sighed, ''I should have used a stapler.''\nDriven by newly documented slumps in learning, by crime rates and by high dropout rates in high school, educators across New York and the nation are struggling to rethink middle school and how best to teach adolescents at a transitional juncture of self-discovery and hormonal change.\nThe difficulty of educating this age group is felt even in many wealthy suburban school districts. But it is particularly intense in cities, where the problems that are compounded in middle school are more acute to begin with and where the search for solutions is most urgent.\nIn Los Angeles, the new superintendent, David L. Brewer III, has vowed to transform middle schools as a top priority, and low-performing schools are experimenting with intensive counseling.\nIn Philadelphia and Baltimore, school systems are trying to make the middle school problem literally disappear, by folding grades six through eight into K-8 schools. In one Columbia, S.C., school district, all five middle schools have begun offering some form of single-sex classes, on the theory that they promote self-esteem and reduce distractions.\nAnd middle schools across the five boroughs of New York City are experimenting with a grab bag of strategies, from adding special periods dedicated to organizational skills, to reducing the number of teachers that each student has. At the Brooklyn Secondary School for Collaborative Studies, in Carroll Gardens, which includes grades 6 through 12, school does not start until 9 a.m., because the principal, Alyce Barr, believes adolescents are by nature not morning people.\nMiddle schools, sometimes called intermediate schools, were created starting in the 1960s, after educators determined that seventh-through-ninth-grade junior high schools were excessively rigid and unattuned to adolescents' personal development. But now, a battery of standardized tests, some required under the No Child Left Behind law, are starkly illustrating that many of these sixth-through-eighth-grade schools are failing, also.\nThe most recent results of math and reading tests given to students in all 50 states showed that between 1999 and 2004, elementary school students made solid gains in reading and math, while middle school students made smaller gains in math and stagnated in reading.\nIn New York State, grade-by-grade testing conducted for the first time last year showed that in rich and poor districts alike, reading scores plunge from the fifth to sixth grade, when most students move to middle school, and continue to decline through eighth grade. The pattern is increasingly seen as a critical impediment to tackling early high school dropout rates as well as the achievement gap separating black and white students.\n''If you don't get them hooked into school here, by the time they leave they're gone.'' said Barry M. Fein, the principal of Seth Low.\nThe troubles transcend test scores. While 74 percent of elementary schools reported at least one violent incident in the 2003-4 school year, 94 percent of middle schools did, federal statistics show.\nMr. Fein spent a recent evening counseling a student who had used a blunt kitchen knife to slash her face and arms: Her wavering self-esteem, it seemed, had ebbed to a low after two friends went out to lunch at McDonald's without her.\n''You handle stuff like that and you go, 'O.K., now you want me to raise test scores?' '' he said. ''They don't really think past tomorrow.''\nIn New York City, almost every kind of experiment is under way. At Intermediate School 211 in Canarsie, students of all grades are grouped into academies with themes like business and cultural arts based on their interests rather than their age. The principal, Buffie Simmons-Peart, confiscates explicit romance novels with airbrushed covers, saying they have a ''dumbifying'' influence.\nI.S. 339, near Claremont Park in the Bronx, is working with Turnaround for Children, a nonprofit group, to focus on the most deeply troubled students, who can have an almost magnetic power over their peers. Nearly every seventh grader has a laptop computer -- an excellent antidote, the principal, Jason Levy, has found, to adolescents' fidgeting and demand for attention.\nThe city has also been experimenting with grade reconfiguration on a grand scale. Since 2004, the Bloomberg administration has converted 42 elementary schools into K-8 schools and closed 14 traditional middle schools, with plans to close eight more by 2008.\nThe city has also recently created 38 schools for grades 6-12, another twist on the middle school model. And 44 large middle schools have been carved into ''small learning communities,'' in which groups of students take their classes together, functioning almost as a school within a school.\nAndres Alonso, the deputy chancellor for teaching and learning, said the department was also revisiting the way sixth through eighth graders are taught science and noted that it had added $40 million yearly for struggling middle school students. ''The work in the middle schools is extraordinarily important,'' Dr. Alonso said.\nAt Seth Low -- also known as I.S. 96 -- in the Bensonhurst neighborhood, Mr. Fein is skeptical of the rush for quick answers.\n''Nobody's ever come down and said, 'This works,' '' he said, speaking amid an office cluttered with John Lennon memorabilia, congratulatory plaques and student work like a glittery card reading ''Mr. Fine, He So Fine.''\nMr. Fein worries about test scores because he has to; although some of his students take a special test to get in, his school is listed as failing under No Child Left Behind because it has narrowly missed performance targets for special education students, Hispanics and non-native English speakers. But scores are not exactly his priority.\nOne recent day, Mr. Fein rode in the back of a police car to a building where a runaway student was hiding out. He climbed to the sixth floor, where he found her, dried her tears and, when she was ready, escorted her down.\nAnother day, he spent hours arguing with superiors who insisted that a suspended student serve her time at a school in Park Slope, which the principal feared was so far away that the girl would never show up.\nStill, Mr. Fein, 58, a former teacher who could have retired three years ago, sticks with it. To cope, he has taken to spending a few predawn minutes meditating in his office, to the glow of candles and a lava lamp.\nStudents also have to find ways to cope. For sixth graders like Atticus Rollins, 12, a video game and science fiction aficionado, the adjustment to middle school has been a strange mix of empowering and emasculating.\nHe likes being able to ''walk wherever you want in the hallways'' without having to follow a teacher ina straight line. Still, he said: ''It feels like you're in kindergarten again, because you're the youngest group of all. There are the tall eighth graders, they're like skyscrapers, you have to look up to them.''\nFor Raechelle Ellison, 11, transition was marked by tears, nightly pleadings to her mother that she did not want to return and the composition of poetry with verses like, ''Life in despair/I don't really care.''\n''Being in middle school is just like a bird being kicked out of its nest by its mother,'' Raechelle mused in the cafeteria one recent morning.\nAt Raechelle's old school, nearly everyone was black, like her; at Seth Low, which has a mix of black, white, Asian and Hispanic students, she was initially the only black person in her class.\nLast year, the private preK-8 school she attended was ''way smaller,'' and she spent most of the day in one classroom, with a single teacher. This year she shuffles from room to room, and it has taken her 10 teachers longer to figure out that her name is neither Rachel nor Rochelle but a unique blend of the two.\nRaechelle, with her earnest reflections and pigtails, seems a world away from the eighth graders who rush into the cafeteria two periods later.\nRobert Combs, 14, whose mind has already turned to high school and the eighth grade prom, listened to 50 Cent on his iPod. Nazli Sevuk, 14, sported a glittering ring from her boyfriend. Kimberly Basic, 13, with long, dark hair and snug jeans, plotted with friends about what to wear and how to meet up for a night out at a nearby nightclub's under-18 party; she can no longer be bothered with eighth grade boys.\nMiddle school teachers point to the gulf between the smooth-skinned sixth grade ''babies'' and these eighth-graders on the verge of adulthood, and note how they must guide these students through the profound transformations of adolescence.\n''These kids go through more change in their lives than at any other time except the first three years,'' said Sue Swaim, executive director of the National Middle School Association.\nThe Seth Low seventh graders have their own theories about why middle school scores plummet.\nNadine George, 12, said she is struggling in science class now because she never understood it in elementary school, despite getting good grades on tests. ''Not that I knew how to do it, but whatever was in my notes I just copied it down,'' she cheerily elaborated.\nJeorge Coronado, 13, said he was distracted now by fights and girls, who were starting to ''look mad good.'' Fabiola Noel, 12, disclosed that during a recent math class, her mind wandered to the look of her hair. In the note that was torn up in science class, Lillian Safa, 13, had asked a friend why a third girl was ignoring her. Two weeks later, Lillian reported, they are once again friends.\nThe Critical Years\nThis is the first article in a series that looks at changing theories of how middle school should be taught.\nThe Critical Years
1816170	The Fiesta Bowl: And Now, A Few More Words	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DA1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	This is the first college football postseason I can recall without Keith Jackson, whose voice defined bowl games. Although Jackson was frustrated with his performance in his finale, last year's Rose Bowl, his presence was welcome. His retirement coincided with the conclusion of ABC's era of dominance over televising the Bowl Championship Series.\nABC still has the Rose, but Fox has the Fiesta, Orange, Sugar and the new national championship game, to be played Monday between Ohio State and Florida in Glendale, Ariz. Bowl games played in the Cactus State are invariably more meaningful than what is perpetrated in the name of the National Football League, and played in the same stadium, by the Cardinals.\nFox began its reign Monday night with Boise State's wild, 43-42 overtime victory over Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl.\nFor the Fiesta -- and the national championship -- Fox assembled an announcing team of Thom Brennaman, better known for calling Fox baseball; Barry Alvarez, the former Wisconsin coach and still its athletic director; and Charles Davis, who is on loan from TBS's college football crew.\nMy interest was mostly in Brennaman. He has called N.F.L. games for Fox, on and off, since 1994, giving him far more experience than Bryant Gumbel had before he mis-stepped into the NFL Network booth.\nBrennaman has never been my favorite baseball announcer, but recently I speculated that his big voice might be better suited for college football, with its rah-rah atmosphere, and need to speak over a loud stadium roar.\nIt turns out that he was pretty good Monday night. He was restrained for much of the game, modulating his voice in a way that will serve him well when he returns to calling baseball for Fox and for the Cincinnati Reds. He grasps the mechanics of the job and the rhythms of the broadcast. He quickly identified players and whether they held onto a pass or not. He knows to say a runner heading downfield is ''inside the 30,'' not crossing it.\nOn many of the night's big plays, he used his profundo voice to convey excitement, not to puncture viewers' ear drums. On Allen Patrick's second quarter 30-yard run for Oklahoma, Brennaman said: ''Give to Patrick. He's inside the sideline, back to the inside, all the way to the 22.'' On a dropped pass by Boise State's Nick Harris, he said: ''Oh, goodness, Nick Harris, an eye on the end zone, but apparently not an eye on the ball.''\nBut he could lose a little control. On Drisan James's 32-yard touchdown reception from Jared Zabransky, which extended the Broncos' lead to 20-10 over the Sooners, Brennaman topped his call with a resounding, ''HOLY MACKEREL!'' As the coda to a score, it was too retro and too loud. In the third, he channeled Dick Enberg with an ''Oh my,'' without a video footnote.\nLate in the fourth, after Marcus Walker's interception for a touchdown put Oklahoma ahead, 34-28, Davis said, ''It may seem trite, but for Oklahoma, it's 'Been there, done that.' '' Advice: if you must utter a banality that need not be said, don't compound it by introducing it as trite.\nAvoiding clichés at crucial moments (unless you invented them) can only improve Brennaman's play-by-play. He needs to eliminate platitudes about how Boise State ''can run with the big dogs.'' In a worse case of overused truisms from the kennel, he said, ''It is not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog,'' on Boise State's hook-and-lateral play that wound up sending the game into overtime.\nBrennaman could also try to use his favorite end-of-touchdown topper -- ''Can you believe it?'' or ''Can you believe that?'' -- only once, instead of twice.\nHow much, after all, can you ask an audience to believe?\nAlvarez and Davis showed promise, meshing well with Brennaman after a few rehearsals in Madison, Wis., and calling one N.F.L. game as a team. They didn't goof around like Brennaman's recently fired baseball partner, Steve Lyons.\nBut Alvarez's official connection to a major Big Ten program is troubling. His ties to the Badgers make him contemporary, but why should the issue of his objectivity, especially with Big Ten rival Ohio State in the national championship game, linger in anyone's mind? What if he upsets Buckeyes Coach Jim Tressel with remarks that would sound like standard criticism from any other analyst, but biased from a former star Big Ten coach?\nAfter Boise State pulled to within one point in the overtime, Davis quickly said the Broncos would go for the win on a 2-point conversion, which they did, deploying the Statue of Liberty play: Zabransky faked a screen pass and hid the ball adroitly with his left hand before handing it off to Ian Johnson. The replays showed Zabransky's legerdemain, and Alvarez said that Oklahoma could only defend what it had seen in game film.\nThe game did not produce spectacular viewership -- an average of 13.7 million people watched -- but the 8.5 rating at the end, at 12:51 a.m. Eastern, exceeded the 8.3 for the entire broadcast. The 2005 Fiesta Bowl, with Utah as the featured midmajor team, playing Pitt, attracted 12.2 million viewers. Last year's Ohio State-Notre Dame Fiesta Bowl generated 20.6 million.\nTV SPORTS E-mail: sportsbiz@nytimes.com
1816171	Numbers Put Up By the Defense Don't Add Up To a Giants Title	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E5DA1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Lost behind the stir of a fired offensive coordinator and the unbending focus on offensive stars -- Tiki this, Eli that, Shockey here, Plaxico there -- toils the part of the Giants that most threatens their chance to win a championship:\nThe defense.\nShould the Giants reach the Super Bowl, they will do so with the lowest-ranked defense in the game's history. The Giants allowed 362 points during the regular season, 24th among 32 teams and the worst among the 12 playoff teams.\nOnly 2 of the 40 Super Bowl champions were ranked outside the top 10 in points allowed, and none were worse than the 13th-ranked Los Angeles Raiders of the 1983 season. In the 22 Super Bowls since, only six teams have made the Super Bowl without a top-10 defense. All of them lost.\nBeginning with Sunday's wild-card game against the Eagles (10-6) in Philadelphia, success for the Giants (8-8) will depend on either a monumental turnaround or on their ability to disprove the axiom that defense wins championships.\n''If we can eliminate the big plays, eliminate the mistakes, and just concentrate on what we have to do, we'll be successful regardless of what the numbers show,'' cornerback R. W. McQuarters said.\nThe defense was a big reason the Giants raced to a 6-2 record by early November. Ranked 11th in total yards, it was stout against the run (eighth, despite allowing 223 yards in an October victory over the Atlanta Falcons) and 16th against the pass.\nIn the second half of the season, when the Giants went 2-6 and felt the effects of injuries, the defense crumbled into one of the worst in the N.F.L.\nThe Giants ended the season 25th in total yards -- 14th against the run and 28th against the pass. Most troubling has been the defense's meek consistency, allowing seven of its final eight opponents to rush for more than 100 yards, and seven of them to pass for more than 200.\nAll the symptoms of a struggling defense are apparent. The Giants finished the regular season ranked 24th in third-down efficiency, 25th in first downs allowed and 26th in sacks per pass play. It does not do anything particularly well.\n''I mean, anyone can see that the pressure is not on the passer the way you'd like it to be,'' Coach Tom Coughlin said Sunday during a conference call, a day after the Giants held off the Washington Redskins, 34-28. ''There's just too much time back there. Even with regard to the run game, we did some good things against the run game, but we also got gapped on occasion, which we have to be able to shut down. We gave up big plays with the pass game.''\nThe Giants allowed 144 points in the first eight games (an 18.0 average), and 218 in the last eight (27.3). Still, the attention falls on the offense, largely because of its star quality -- Tiki Barber, Eli Manning, Jeremy Shockey and Plaxico Burress -- and its inability to outscore its opponents consistently.\nBarber said the defense's ineffectiveness has changed the mind-set of the offense, slicing its margin for error. More than ever, each scoring opportunity must be seized.\nThe Giants expected better. In 2005, they were 11-5 and lost in the first round of the playoffs. They left the offense intact; all 11 starters returned.\nBut the defense, coordinated by Tim Lewis, was overhauled. In the season opener, 8 of the 11 starters were either new or did not get most of the starts at their position the season before. The defense found its groove after a few games. But in the sixth game, linebacker LaVar Arrington was lost for the season.\nTwo weeks later, defensive end Michael Strahan hurt his right foot. He played only part of one of the season's final eight games and will not play in the playoffs. Others have missed games, too.\nPlayers do not make excuses about injuries -- the Eagles, after all, lost their premier pass rusher, Jevon Kearse, for the season in their second game -- but it is difficult to otherwise diagnose the Giants' late-season collapse.\nIt left the Giants in no better shape than in 2005, and a likely target for another overhaul this off-season.\nLast season's team was 24th in the league in yards allowed and gave up 314 points. This season's team was 25th in yards and allowed 362 points. The difference is that the current Giants have not made up for their elasticity with big plays.\nThe 2005 team forced 37 turnovers (20 fumbles, 17 interceptions) and had 41 sacks. The 2006 team forced only 28 turnovers (11 fumbles, 17 interceptions) and had 32 sacks.\nThat has left the Giants defensive players grasping for answers, not just quarterbacks. Asked to name the unit's strengths, players often hesitate. They usually say that just a few plays each game make the difference.\n''We're not that far off,'' said the rookie defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka, who has started 10 games because of injuries to others.\n''If you watch every game, if you watch every play, there is not these huge debacles going on out there,'' he said. ''It may be one thing here, one thing there. So when we get those thing corrected, you'll see what kind of defense we really are.''\nTime is running out. History awaits.\nEXTRA POINTS\nThe Giants placed cornerback Corey Webster on injured reserve because of toe and hip injuries. He was replaced on the roster by the rookie cornerback R. J. Cobbs, who was signed to the practice squad on Dec. 19. Linebacker Brandon Short on the difference between Tiki Barber and Brian Westbrook: ''Tiki is probably smarter, probably craftier. Westbrook is probably more explosive.''\nPRO FOOTBALL

Parity Ensures Anxiety Is Shared Equally	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E5DA1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	It was not Michael Vick and the ingenuity required to coach him that unraveled Jim Mora in Atlanta or Arizona's genetic losing disorder that vanquished Dennis Green in the desert.\nTerrell Owens's daily Dallas dramas aren't the reason Bill Parcells resembles a pale, haunted figure out of Tim Burton's imagination, and locker-room dissent at Giants Stadium isn't to blame for Tom Coughlin's destiny as an anger-management patient.\nCoach killers are not rebel players or doomed franchises or the injury fates. What kills a coach most often -- whether he is fired, quits or retires -- is N.F.L. parity. Or socialized football brought to you by the hard salary cap.\nThe league put in the hard cap in 1993 to provide every team, no matter how large the owner's wallet, an even chance to compete for the Super Bowl. Basically, these league landlords devised a system to promote mediocrity while insisting their teams rise above it. In essence, owners are desperate to hire safe crackers for their own homes.\nSome coaches catch on quickly to the league's win resistance. There is only one rationale for the Dolphins' Nick Saban to spend another day contemplating an offer from the University of Alabama after only two years in the pros: He is not sure if he can win at Miami -- and win consistently -- when talent, facilities and payroll are virtually equal in the N.F.L.\nCall it reverse separation anxiety. Coaches fear a league archetype that makes it nearly impossible for them to distinguish themselves year after year.\nWho among coaches is brilliant enough to consistently break the code of parity? You can list New England's Bill Belichick for one and Pittsburgh's Bill Cowher as another if he remains with the Steelers. Cowher is truly the one without equal because of his parallel life with the league's widget culture.\nDozens of coaches have been hired and fired since Cowher became the familiar face -- and jaw -- of the Steelers in 1992, but as The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette pointed out last week, 30 of those whistle-wearing miracle workers ended their N.F.L. stays below .500.\nThree coaches -- Mike Ditka, George Seifert and Tom Flores -- were celebrated Super Bowl winners in the halcyon days before cap constraints, but all exited without confetti-filled sendoffs, as if the league's new math was beyond their magic.\nThis makes Cowher's career record (149-90-1) remarkable because it has included just three losing seasons. Is Cowher emotional? Yes. Is he polarizing? Definitely. But through the years, he remained a consistent contender when other teams rebuilt and won and rebuilt again. Many coaches have started out well, with splashy first impressions, but they also arrive with gifts from their predecessor's lowly season: easy schedule, top draft pick.\nWinning is grueling from there. The mental exhaustion is in the dark circles and bloodshot eyes of every coach. Who among them can withstand the pressure of parity's mind games?\nMeltdowns among coaches are a weekly occurrence. Under stress to reveal their Rubik's Cube genius on game day, coaches are regularly fraying at the edges. Nothing sends an owner to a job fair faster than a coach who has lost control.\nMora could not have been thinking clearly when, on a radio show last month, he confessed his love for the University of Washington's coaching job when a) it was occupied by Tyrone Willingham, and b) his Falcons were in the playoff picture before spiraling to a 7-9 finish.\nMora claimed he was joking, but he was only kidding himself. Delusion is one symptom of parity's burden. Postgame distemper is another.\nAfter the Cardinals blew a 20-point lead Oct. 16 against Chicago on ''Monday Night Football,'' Green's bizarre tirade became all the rage on YouTube.\nThis wasn't about Arizona's defeatist culture. It was the curse of a tease. If, for three quarters, the Cardinals proved they were equal to a Bears team that was undefeated at the time, why couldn't they be anything more than coffee grounds at the bottom of the pot?\nParity anxiety is a trigger to coach self-destruction. Coughlin can probably save his job if the Giants win their first-round playoff game, but if he should exit early, he'll be remembered for an absurd sideline outburst against Mathias Kiwanuka.\nA missed sack of the Titans' Vince Young wasn't the issue -- just a sign of Coughlin's panic with his underachieving team.\nOwners created these insecure leaders. Some understand that the best chance to escape their own mousetrap is by smart investment, not just in the savvy coach, but in a prodigious executive cast.\nWhat has Jon Gruden mustered at Tampa Bay since General Manager Rich McKay left? And would Belichick be the same savant without Scott Pioli as his personnel guru?\n''I'd say what sets you apart is how you handle parity and salary cap -- and are they intertwined? I think so,'' the longtime N.F.L. agent Steve Rosner said. ''If a team invests in hiring three guys at the top of the organization -- a general manager, a personnel director and a head coach -- that gives you a chance to separate yourself. I'd rather see a senior executive paid another $500,000 than a third-string quarterback.''\nOwners devised a hard-cap model that has saved them tons in player money, but what has parity cost them? An expensive search to find a system hacker for a coach.\nSPORTS OF THE TIMES E-mail: selenasports@nytimes.com
1816173	Yankees Crave Young Pitchers, but Have One Eye on Clemens	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E5DA1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Yankees hope to have at least one 44-year-old starting pitcher later this year. If they can trade Randy Johnson to the Arizona Diamondbacks, they will have more money available to sign Roger Clemens.\nThe Yankees and the Diamondbacks continued their trade talks yesterday, with Arizona hoping for a resolution so it can begin a 72-hour window for negotiating with Johnson, who must approve any deal. The Diamondbacks had not been granted that window as of last night.\nJohnson, who turns 44 in September, probably needs two seasons to reach 300 victories. He has 280 and is coming off back surgery, and he most likely wants a contract that takes him through 2008.\nClemens, who has 348 victories in his career, is in no such hurry to get back on a mound. He waited until June 22 to return to the Houston Astros last year, and his agent, Randy Hendricks, favors a similar approach this season.\n''I have suggested a partial season again,'' Hendricks said in an e-mail message. ''Roger has yet to decide whether he will play, so there is no point trying to pinpoint the timing. It is fair to say that if he does, it will be for Houston, Boston or New York.''\nThe Yankees signed Andy Pettitte last month, giving them another left-hander making $16 million, which is what they owe Johnson this season. Pettitte has been Clemens's teammate for eight seasons, and he said last month that he expected Clemens to keep pitching.\nClemens went 7-6 with a 2.30 earned run average for Houston last season and has been better recently than Johnson, whose E.R.A. last season rose to a career-high 5.00 despite his 17 victories.\nClemens is tied with Cy Young as Boston's career leader with 192 victories, and the idea of returning there could intrigue him. But Clemens has strong ties to Pettitte and other Yankees, and if the Yankees shed most of Johnson's salary in a trade, there is no reason to think they will let another team outbid them for Clemens.\nAs they monitor Clemens, the Yankees want to stockpile young pitching, as they did when they traded outfielder Gary Sheffield to Detroit in November for three minor leaguers. Arizona has one of the deepest farm systems in baseball, with pitching prospects like Brandon Medders, Micah Owings, Dustin Nippert and Ross Ohlendorf.\nOhlendorf graduated from Princeton and has a hard sinker, the pitch that Chien-Ming Wang has used to great effect for the Yankees. Ohlendorf had 129 strikeouts and only 29 walks in 183 2/3 innings at two minor league levels last season.\n''He's a workhorse,'' said Scott Bradley, Princeton's baseball coach. ''He was going to go to spring training with a real legitimate chance to make their staff. He's been a starter his whole minor league career, but a lot of people think because he's so durable that he could be a seventh- or eighth-inning guy. He gives up very few home runs because everything's got that downward sink to it.''\nBradley was also Johnson's catcher with the Seattle Mariners in the early 1990s, and they have remained friends. He has not spoken to Johnson since the Yankees began trade talks, but said it stood to reason that Johnson would favor a return to the Phoenix area, where Johnson lives.\n''For him, I know it would make things a lot easier in terms of being closer to home,'' Bradley said.\nThe trickier issue for Johnson and the Diamondbacks will be working out the financial details. Arizona has only $10 million remaining in its 2007 payroll budget, so the Yankees may have to pay part of his salary. The more the Yankees pay, the better the prospects they are likely to receive.\nThe Diamondbacks also owe Johnson $40 million in deferred payments from his previous tenure in Arizona, and the team may want to revise the payment schedule as a condition of the trade.\nJohnson's agents, Barry Meister and Alan Nero, did not return calls seeking comment.\nBASEBALL
1816175	THE TWO SIDES OF JIM TRESSEL	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E5DA1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Jim Tressel's six years of coaching Ohio State have presented a jarring contrast of Ozzie and Harriet virtue and Ozzy Osbourne excess.\nIf the top-ranked Buckeyes defeat Florida in the Bowl Championship Series title game Jan. 8, Tressel will win his second national championship in five seasons. In the view of many, he will join Pete Carroll of Southern California as the greatest college football coaches of their generation.\nWoody Hayes was brilliant in winning three national titles at Ohio State, but he was also volatile and, ultimately, self-destructive. Tressel, by contrast, projects a groomed blandness -- the gray man with the gray hair in the gray sweater vest who represents integrity, loyalty, humility, self-control, academic probity.\nAmong the Buckeye faithful, Tressel's rectitude is punctuated as emphatically as the ''i'' in the marching band's famous script Ohio routine.\nAdulation on campus has approached deification with signs like ''God Wears Sweater Vests'' and ''In Tressel We Trust.'' He talks of sharing a parent's responsibility for his players and seems to symbolize, in his shirt-and-tie righteousness, a bygone era when football spoke to expectations of manhood. Fans and professors say that if Tressel, 54, chose to run for governor of Ohio, he would most likely win.\n''They'd better hold the election before I lose a game,'' he said, joking.\nYet Tressel also has detractors who dispute the authenticity of his image, mock him on Internet message boards as CheatyPants SweaterVest and note that he has been touched by scandal both at Ohio State and Youngstown State, where he previously won four Division I-AA national championships.\nAt both colleges, his top quarterback took money from boosters in violation of N.C.A.A. rules. Maurice Clarett, the running back who played a vital role in Ohio State's national championship in 2002, sits in prison after a sad descent. A number of other Ohio State players has encountered legal or disciplinary problems since Tressel became head coach in 2001, and his academic record, while improving, remains mixed.\n''However you want to look at Jim Tressel, as all that is right with college football, or what is wrong, you can probably find evidence to support your case,'' said Bruce Hooley, a radio talk-show host who formerly covered Ohio State football for The Cleveland Plain Dealer.\nEven a staunch ally, the former Ohio State athletic director Andy Geiger, concedes that Tressel can be so guarded in public as to appear calculating and less than candid.\nIn September, as Ohio State prepared to face Texas, Tressel said that he had voted the Longhorns atop the coaches' poll, when he actually had voted his Buckeyes No. 1. Then Ohio State gave what many considered to be a tortured explanation about how a staff member assigned to turn in Tressel's ballot had made a mistake.\nIn early December, Tressel declined to vote in the final B.C.S. poll, saying it would be a conflict of interest to play a role in selecting Ohio State's title-game opponent, whether it be Florida or archrival Michigan. Among Buckeye supporters, this was seen as the right, even noble, thing to do.\n''Even a judge has the ability to recuse himself from a case,'' Gene Smith, Ohio State's athletic director, said.\nElsewhere, Tressel was widely criticized. Lloyd Carr, the Michigan coach, called Tressel's nonvote ''real slick.'' Mike Leach, the Texas Tech coach, called his abstention ''sanctimonious bunk.''\nAnd Michigan fans, stung by five defeats in six games against the Tressel-coached Buckeyes, got to imagine that the real reason for his refraining was fear of a rematch with the Wolverines, who narrowly lost to Ohio State, 42-39, here in November.\nIn Ann Arbor, He's 'a Weasel'\nIn Ann Arbor, Tressel has become a convenient foil, said Andrei Markovits, a professor of politics and German studies at Michigan. Ohio State is viewed as everything that Michigan purports not to be, Markovits said, noting that Wolverine supporters rejoice in Ohio State's highly publicized troubles and convince themselves that Carr operates a cleaner, more honorable program.\nThe thinking at Michigan, Markovits said, is, ''They may be better than us, but Tressel is basically a weasel and an opportunist and probably runs dirty things, and we are saints.'' At some point, though, Markovits said, this holier-than-thou attitude becomes sour grapes, because ''they have won and we haven't; that ultimately hurts.''\nIn Columbus, it seems impossible to overstate the good will that Tressel has accrued from his 5-1 record against Michigan. The rivalry is so fierce and consuming that, nearly four decades after guiding Ohio State to the 1968 national championship and losing to the Wolverines in 1969, the former quarterback Rex Kern will refer to the Buckeyes' principal opponent only as ''that school up north.''\nIf John Cooper, Tressel's predecessor, had gone 10-2-1 against the Wolverines instead of 2-10-1, he might still be coaching Ohio State, many here believe. At a recent Ohio State basketball game, a number of fans complained that Cooper, a Tennessean, ''just didn't get it'' when it came to the urgency of the Michigan rivalry.\n''If I had to choose between winning a national championship and beating Michigan, I'd choose beating Michigan,'' said James Hunt, 49, a Buckeye fan from Vermilion, Ohio.\nIn a much-told story, Tressel greeted an Ohio State basketball crowd shortly after being hired in January 2001 with these words: ''I can assure you that you'll be proud of our young people, in the classroom, in the community and especially in 310 days in Ann Arbor, Michigan.''\nHe was the son of a renowned coach, and an Ohio native, and with one sentence Tressel demonstrated that he understood what Ohioans held dear. Personally, the Ohio State-Michigan rivalry also held a sentimental attachment. His father, Lee Tressel, coached Baldwin-Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, and though he won a Division III national title in 1978, Lee's season often ended before the Buckeyes met the Wolverines, Jim said.\n''It was the one time of the season we knew we'd get to see him,'' Tressel said of his father. They are the only father and son to win national collegiate football championships.\nBefore Lee Tressel died of lung cancer in 1981, Hayes drove from Columbus to sit with him, a fellow coach, Jim said. His own connection to Ohio State began as an assistant coach here in the mid-1980s. Since becoming head coach, Tressel has embraced many Buckeye rituals -- mingling his team with fans and band members before games, requiring his players to sing the alma mater after games.\nHe even persuaded Dick Schafrath, a former Buckeye star, to return to college to get his degree, nearly a half-century after leaving Ohio State for the Cleveland Browns. Apparently, though, Tressel did not expect Schafrath, 71, to run onto the field with the current squad before a game against Minnesota in October.\n''He said, 'What are you doing? You've got a pacemaker/defibrillator!' '' Schafrath recalled. ''I figured, what better way to go than to have 105,000 people screaming at you.''\nThe Sweater Vest\nAccording to Ohio State officials, Tressel also has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to such causes as cancer research and refurbishing the campus library. At a recent gathering of library donors, Timothy Curry, a sports sociologist at Ohio State, said that Tressel left the audience smitten by pretending to speak to a recruit on his cellphone, telling the imagined player that he would soon have a chance to play in the greatest college stadium and study in the greatest college library.\nHis sweater-vest style on the sideline -- variously described as senatorial, professorial and Kroger stock-boy -- provides further symbolic evidence that, despite his yearly salary of $2.4 million, Tressel does not consider himself apart or above others at Ohio State, Curry said.\n''He didn't become part of the athletic department; he became part of O.S.U.,'' Cathy Baack, who received her Ph.D. in nursing from Ohio State and was formerly a member of the university athletic council, said of Tressel.\nHe coaches with the orderliness and precision of a student who preferred math to English and who awakened at 5:30 every morning from fourth grade to 12th grade to run his paper route.\nHis father wore a bowtie on the sideline, hence Tressel's avoidance of the Bill Belichick hoodie look. And, friends say, his affection for singing the alma mater might stem from his late mother, Eloise, who led songs and cheers at Baldwin-Wallace, where Jim played quarterback for his father and the family lived next to the stadium.\nYet adherence to ritual does not mean rigidity. Tressel has belied his conservative image with increased reliance on the spread offense this season. On Ohio State's first touchdown against Michigan in November, the Buckeyes threw a 1-yard scoring pass from a formation that included no running backs -- a stark departure from the 3-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust ethos of Hayes.\n''Jimmy has taken all of Woody's great qualities and not taken any of Woody's bad ones,'' Kern, the former quarterback, said in reference to Hayes's explosive temper, which got him fired after he struck an opposing player.\nThe current Buckeyes say they appreciate Tressel for his calm demeanor, his genuineness, his spoken desire to make them better men as well as better players and his social grace in remembering the names of his 100-plus players and their parents.\n''He cares about what kind of men we become,'' defensive tackle David Patterson said.\nDoug Datish, the starting center, said, ''He's not hypocritical.''\nBeyond football, Tressel represents what many Ohioans want in themselves -- respectability, lack of ostentation, letting actions speak louder than words, said Mel Adelman, an Ohio State professor who teaches a course in college sports. Those who find fault with Tressel have unreasonable expectations of a college football coach, he said.\n''The academy is not a place of total integrity and not a place of pure academics,'' Adelman said. ''It has multiple agendas. One of those is the building of community. Unless you compare him against an ideal that never existed, he is fine.''\nView From Afar\nThe farther the distance from Columbus, the less that view is monolithic. Some find discrepancies between Tressel's perceived virtuousness and a more complicated reality.\nAccording to a list compiled by The Associated Press, 20 Ohio State players were arrested or faced disciplinary action for rules violations between Tressel's hiring in 2001 and 2005, though the athletic director Gene Smith said there had been no instances of misconduct the past two seasons.\nA number of the arrests were alcohol-related, but one player pleaded guilty to robbery, and another pleaded guilty to felony charges related to drug and gun possession. Two others were suspended after being charged with marijuana trafficking and passing fake in-house currency at a strip club.\nQuarterback Troy Smith, who this season brought Ohio State its seventh Heisman Trophy, was convicted of misdemeanor disorderly conduct after a 2003 fight in a campus parking lot, where, a woman reported, her jaw had been broken. He was later suspended for two games bridging the 2004 and 2005 seasons after accepting about $500 from a booster.\nEarly in 2005, an editorial in The Dayton Daily News said the booster incident, following other player misconduct, made Ohio State ''look like a second-rate, generic state school, that has no reputation beyond sports and parties -- and seeks none.''\nBill Livingston of The Cleveland Plain Dealer, one of Ohio's most influential sports columnists, said of Tressel in an interview, ''I'm a great admirer of him as a game-day coach, but the public image of the man doesn't measure up in all aspects.''\nThe most notorious scandal of the Tressel era at Ohio State involved Clarett, the freshman star during the 2002 championship season whose career soon imploded. He was suspended in 2003 for N.C.A.A. rules violations, and would not play again, his early success corroded by questions of preferential treatment in the classroom; falsification of a police report involving stolen items from a car borrowed from a local auto dealer; and Clarett's accusations that he was provided with cash and a no-show job.\nOhio State denied any wrongdoing and Clarett's most explosive charges were never verified. Clarett is now in prison in Toledo, serving at least three and a half years on charges of aggravated robbery and carrying a concealed weapon.\nThe Clarett and Troy Smith episodes bore some resemblance to an incident that occurred during Tressel's tenure as coach at Youngstown State. The university was cited by the N.C.A.A. for lack of institutional control after Ray Isaac, who quarterbacked the 1991 team to a Division I-AA championship, was later found to have accepted $10,000 and access to cars provided by the former chairman of Youngstown State's board of trustees.\nTressel faced no official reprimand in the Clarett, Smith and Isaac cases and has said he was not aware of any wrongdoing. Among Buckeye fans, the blame clearly rests with the players, not the coach. Tressel's critics, though, have asked whether he did not know about improprieties because he did not want to know.\n''He's more complicated than 'Senator Tressel in the sweater vest,' always meaning and doing and saying the right things,'' said Dominic Mango, Clarett's lawyer and an Ohio State graduate. ''He's got to understand big-time college athletics and what goes on. Does he have his hands dirty? Probably not. But to say he did not know these things happen or never heard of it, it's not possible.''\nAsked after Clarett was arrested last summer whether university officials bore any responsibility for his downfall, Geiger, the former athletic director, said: ''Maybe because we took him in the first place. If we're guilty of something that is borderline corrupt, it's sometimes bringing people into the community that don't really fit. I would plead guilty to that.''\nIn a recent interview, Tressel said he asked himself how things might have turned out better for Clarett, but added, ''I don't have regret about feeling I didn't try to help.''\nTheir relationship appears more layered than is generally perceived. Tressel genuinely seemed to be attempting to find Clarett a spot in N.F.L. Europe before his latest legal troubles, Mango said. Jon Saia, a law partner of Mango's, said that Tressel also appeared willing to testify on Clarett's behalf if his case had gone to trial instead of ending with a plea arrangement.\nBefore Clarett's arrest last summer, Tressel and others said, Clarett spoke to the coach by phone and urged him: ''Keep doing what you're doing. People need to hear your message.''\nBuckeye supporters prefer to speak not about the fall of Clarett but about the maturation of Troy Smith, who has moved beyond his early troubles and has obtained his degree in addition to winning the Heisman Trophy.\n''For every Maurice Clarett, you could point to six or seven or eight kids who have no business making it but who are thriving,'' said John Bruno, a psychology professor and Ohio State's faculty athletics representative. ''You can't imagine how far Troy has come in five years. Troy deserves no small credit. Jim deserves significant credit, too.''\nStudents and Athletes\nBruno and Gene Smith, the athletic director, have deflected a recent study indicating that, among the 64 bowl teams, only Georgia (24 percent) had a lower graduation rate of black players than Ohio State (32 percent). The study also showed that Ohio State scored 925 -- a minimal level of acceptance -- on the so-called Academic Progress Rating, which tracks athletes' advancement toward graduation and can result in a reduction of scholarships for noncompliance.\nFigures used by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport for the graduation rate of black players, however, came from the late 1990s, before Tressel became head coach. Regarding the progress rating, the most recently available data revealed a steady improvement, leaving Ohio State in no jeopardy of losing scholarships, Bruno said.\nFor the most recent quarter, 60 of Ohio State's 103 players scored 3.0 or higher on their grade-point averages, the best result in 11 years, Smith said. The overall team grade-point average for the quarter was 2.89; for the 47 black players it was 2.66, ''not far off,'' Smith said. Of the eight players who graduated most recently, five were black, Smith said.\n''Jim has changed the culture,'' Smith said of Tressel.\nPerhaps, but the most important change for many Buckeye fans seems to have little to do with grade-point averages.\n''When we discuss Jim Tressel and whether he does things the right way, obviously the majority says he does,'' Hooley, the talk-show host, said. ''A few people see things they don't like, but there's always another Michigan game around the corner, and he always seems to win that game.''\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL
1816176	Louisville Hoping Big Finish Carries Over to Next Season	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E5DA1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	The long path to respect and recognition was about to be completed by Louisville. The Cardinals had only recently raised their national profile with the move to the Big East from Conference USA two seasons ago, and the Orange Bowl on Tuesday night at Dolphin Stadium was to be the final step in Louisville's ascension to the short list of national contenders for next season.\nIf only the No. 5 Cardinals could beat a Wake Forest team dismissed by some as an opportunistic champion in a down year for the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nThe No. 15 Demon Deacons, accustomed to being underrated and underestimated, made it much harder than Louisville fans might have preferred. But in the end, the Cardinals earned their place with a 24-13 victory against Wake Forest in front of 74,470 in the first Bowl Championship Series game for these programs on the rise.\nIn a game defined by defense through most of three quarters, it was the offenses that finally took over in the fourth. And that was why high-powered Louisville won. Cardinals quarterback Brian Brohm, the game's most valuable player, directed an eight-play, 81-yard drive that was capped by a 1-yard touchdown run by Anthony Allen with 12 minutes 31 seconds remaining to give the Cardinals a 17-13 lead.\nBrohm completed 24 of 34 for 312 yards, third most in Orange Bowl history behind Tom Brady of Michigan and Matt Leinart of Southern California.\n''Just to be mentioned with those guys' names is a special thing,'' Brohm said.\nBrock Bolen added an 18-yard touchdown run with 4:55 remaining to seal the victory for Louisville (12-1). The Cardinals could begin next season among the leading contenders for the national championship if Brohm and the injured running back Michael Bush return instead of entering the N.F.L. draft.\nAfter the game, fans chanted ''One more year!'' and Brohm said, ''Right now, coming back and trying to win the national title is very appealing.''\nWake Forest (11-3) completed its best season in team history with the A.C.C. championship and its first 11-win season.\n''I told the kids in the locker room after the game to be really proud of what we've accomplished,'' Wake Forest Coach Jim Grobe said. ''It's funny. You get in the Orange Bowl and being in the Orange Bowl feels really, really good. But when you lose, it doesn't feel any different than when you lose any other time.''\nThe game was not the offensive barrage that Louisville fans had come to expect from a Cardinals team that came in scoring 38.9 points a game. Wake Forest, with a defense that posted a 30-0 shutout at Florida State earlier in the season and advanced to the Orange Bowl with a 9-6 victory over Georgia Tech in the A.C.C. title game, would not have it.\nIndeed, it took a trick play for the Cardinals to take a 10-3 lead at halftime. And Wake Forest erased that deficit on its first drive of the second half, when Riley Skinner completed a 30-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Nate Morton three and a half minutes into the third quarter to tie the score at 10-10. It was the first touchdown in six quarters for the Demon Deacons, dating to a victory at Maryland on Nov. 25.\nWake Forest appeared on its way to taking the lead later in the quarter, but running back Rich Belton fumbled at the Louisville 14-yard line.\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Wake Forest took the first lead when Sam Swank kicked a 44-yard field goal 43 seconds into the second quarter. How dominant were the defenses? The score came after a Demon Deacons drive that went exactly one yard. Wake Forest had gained the field position on what appeared to be a partly blocked punt that went just 14 yards and gave the Demon Deacons the ball on Louisville's 28. This came after a first quarter in which Wake Forest was held to 24 total yards of offense, including minus-27 yards rushing.\nStill, the Demon Deacons were in the game because Louisville's offense was not much more productive. The Cardinals totaled 34 yards in the opening quarter, with the highly touted Brohm managing just 8 yards on 2-of-4 passing.\nA poor punt by Swank set up the lone touchdown of the first half. It came on an option pass from wide receiver Patrick Carter, a former quarterback, who took a lateral from Brohm near the right sideline and threw across the field to an open Allen on the far side of the field. He easily ran in for the 21-yard touchdown reception and a 10-3 Louisville lead with 5:53 to go in the half.\nAlthough there has been much speculation about Brohm's future and the possibility he could pass up his senior season and enter the N.F.L. draft, it was a redshirt freshman, Skinner, who put up more impressive numbers in the first half. Skinner was 10 of 13 for 124 yards; Brohm was 7 of 13 for 79 yards.\nSkinner finished 21 of 33 for 272 yards with a touchdown and an interception.\nFOOTBALL
1816177	Hossa Delivers for Rangers in Shootout With Devils	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E5DA1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	In the excitement of a shootout against the Devils on Tuesday night, a game the Rangers felt they desperately needed to win, Marcel Hossa took the ice as the Rangers' eighth shooter.\nHe followed a trail of sharpshooting teammates, including Jaromir Jagr, Brendan Shanahan and Martin Straka. But if he was nervous in such a crucial spot, he betrayed none of it.\n''He just looked like the smoothest, coolest guy out there,'' Shanahan said.\nAs Hossa skated in on Devils goalie Martin Brodeur, he pulled Brodeur wide and calmly fired a shot into the upper left corner, then turned to smile at his teammates, who were celebrating wildly.\nOne more save by Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist, on Travis Zajac, and the Rangers were celebrating a 3-2 victory over a team that seems to bring out the best in them.\nThe victory pulled the Rangers (20-17-4) a point closer to the Devils (22-13-4), who lead the Atlantic Division. The Rangers, 4 points behind the Devils in second place, have won three of the teams' four meetings this season.\nBut the most important part of this one was mental.\nJust four days earlier, the Rangers were mired in a seven-game losing streak. They ended it with a home victory Saturday against Washington, but beating a struggling team at home does not offer the same boost in confidence that beating a first-place team on the road does.\nAnd they vanquished the Devils in spectacular fashion.\nLundqvist had stopped all 22 shots he had faced in the Rangers' four shootouts this season, a record that came to a screeching halt when Zach Parise scored on the Devils' first shot. In all, Lundqvist gave up three goals in the shootout. But Brodeur allowed goals to Michael Nylander Shanahan, Matt Cullen and Hossa.\nIt was the second time this season that Hossa won a shootout for the Rangers; he put a shot through the pads of Flyers goalie Antero Niittymaki in the 13th round on Oct. 7 in Philadelphia.\nHossa has scored only once in regulation this season. His shot against the Flyers, however, helped him climb a few notches up the shootout chart. Hossa said it had also increased his confidence in trying a far more difficult shot against Brodeur.\n''I was thinking I would go five-hole again, but maybe my brother scored too many goals on him five-hole so he would think I was going to do the same,'' Hossa said, laughing, referring to his brother Marian, a star forward for Atlanta who has scored 23 more goals than he has this season. ''This time I did a different thing and it went through.''\nThe Devils said they were happy to collect a point for taking the game to overtime. Jamie Langenbrunner's power-play goal with 4 minutes 12 seconds left in regulation allowed them to tie the score at 2-2.\n''It was a hard-earned point,'' Devils Coach Claude Julien said. ''We'll take it and move on.''\nLangenbrunner had a chance to win the game in the shootout as well, as the Devils' seventh shooter, pulling Lundqvist wide and nearly stuffing in a backhand. But Lundqvist stretched his glove to the right post and nudged the puck aside.\nThat turn of events allowed Hossa to score the winner.\nThe Rangers played a solid game to reach the shootout. After falling behind, 1-0, in the first on a goal by John Madden, they came back on goals by Nylander and Petr Prucha before Langenbrunner tied it late.\nThe remarkable part of Prucha's goal was how the puck got to him. Jagr deflected a pass from defenseman Karel Rachunek with his right skate and sent it to a waiting Prucha, unguarded at the left post.\n''I tried to kick it in the net,'' Jagr said. ''I missed that. I wanted to go top shelf. I'll be working on it tomorrow.''\nShootouts, it seems, have become a specialty for the Rangers, who are now 5-1 in them. And they can turn to their secret weapon when they need to win one.\n''It was a terrific move,'' Renney said of Hossa's shot. ''This is one of the best goalies to ever play the game. Hoss should feel good about himself right about now.''\nSLAP SHOTS\nRangers forward Jed Ortmeyer played his first game since doctors found he had a pulmonary embolism in August. He played only nine shifts, for 5 minutes 35 seconds of ice time. Forward Jarkko Immonen was a healthy scratch. ... Devils defenseman Colin White missed his fourth straight game with a groin injury.\nHOCKEY
1816178	Artest Reminds the Knicks What They're Missing	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DA1730F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	There is no shortage of ghosts in the Knicks' file cabinet of misguided transactions, and perhaps none more haunting than the image of Ron Artest, all muscle and swagger, hitting shots from every panel of the hardwood.\nArtest could have been a Knick in 1999 when he came out of St. John's. The Knicks famously passed on him, taking Frédéric Weis of France with the 15th pick, leaving Artest for the Chicago Bulls.\n''Oh yeah, how's he doing?'' Artest asked wryly.\nThe Knicks could no sooner answer that question than they could find an answer for Artest later in the evening. Artest scored on layups and fadeaways, from near and from far, and collected a career-high 39 points to lead the Sacramento Kings to a 112-100 rout at Arco Arena on Tuesday night.\n''That's the type of player he is,'' sad Knicks Coach Isiah Thomas, who coached Artest while with the Pacers. ''He has the ability to win a game by himself.''\nThomas added: ''He's one of the best players in our game. He's got great poise, he's got great patience. He knows when to score and how to score.''\nIt was Artest's first game against the Knicks (13-21), his hometown team, since Nov. 13, 2004, when he was with the Indiana Pacers. Shortly after that night, Artest was suspended for his role in the Detroit-Indiana brawl. He was traded to the Kings (14-15) last season, after the Knicks had already played them twice.\nThe Knicks avoided some of the baggage that comes with the erratic Artest, but clearly lost out on a lot of talent as well. Artest made 15 of 22 field-goals attempts and had 8 rebounds. He overwhelmed Jared Jeffries with his strength, and was also too much for David Lee or Malik Rose. ''He looked like he was just out there having fun,'' the Knicks' Stephon Marbury said of Artest.\nArtest's performance rendered moot the Knicks' resurgent offense. After two games of shooting below 40 percent, they hit 49.4 percent of their shots . Jamal Crawford broke out of his slump by making 11 of 23 field goals and scoring 28 points. Eddy Curry had 19 points and 6 rebounds but failed to take advantage of a small Kings frontcourt. Sacramento lost Brad Miller to early foul trouble and then to a third-quarter ejection for arguing with a referee.\nCoach Isiah Thomas spent the past several days pining for a reliable shooter -- specifically for the return of Quentin Richardson some time this week. Reassurance came sooner than expected, and from a different guard. Crawford made four 3-pointers and for a time looked like he would lead a comeback. The Knicks trailed from wire to wire, by as many as 14 points, but came within 7 points in the middle of the fourth quarter.\nThe Knicks misfired the rest of the evening, while Artest, Mike Bibby (19 points) and Corliss Williamson put the game away. It left the Knicks 0-3 on this five-game trip.\nHelp is on the way. Nate Robinson's suspension ends after Friday's game in Seattle. And there is a chance that Quentin Richardson will play that night.\nDr. Lisa Callahan, the team's director of player care, examined Richardson Tuesday night, and the report on his back was mostly positive: He was slightly stiff from Monday's workout, and listed as doubtful for Wednesday's game in Portland. He is considered questionable for the Seattle game.\nWith only three guards available for the past two games, the Knicks' offense has suffered. And without much outside shooting, defenses have been free to harass Curry.\n''The lack of shooting right now at that position is a concern,'' Thomas said before the game. ''With Richardson and Robinson soon to be back, that's something that can definitely be cured. But right now on this trip it has been a concern.''\nThe Knicks' last missing piece is Steve Francis, who is in Houston treating the tendinitis in his right knee. Despite speculation to the contrary, every indication is that he intends to return once he is healthy.\nFrancis is working out twice a day, for two hours at a time, with his personal trainer to strengthen the knee, according to his agent, Jeff Fried.\n''Steve is doing this so he can give it the necessary time and attention and get back with his teammates and produce in a meaningful manner,'' Fried said. ''He wants to get back with his teammates.''\nIt would seem that Francis came back too soon from his last sabbatical. Francis shut himself down in mid-December and planned to rest for two to three weeks. Had he stayed on that schedule, he would have been re-evaluated this week. But when the Knicks lost Richardson to injury and Robinson, Mardy Collins and Jeffries to suspension, Francis played sparingly in three games before deciding to shut himself down again.\nThe hope is that Francis will be reevaluated in two weeks and could perhaps be cleared to play. In the meantime, Thomas has an easier job of managing his guard rotation.\nThe Knicks had a glut of guards to start the season and will again once Richardson and Robinson return. Without the pressure to start Francis (in deference to his $15 million salary), Thomas can use Richardson and Crawford, both natural shooting guards, next to Marbury, with Robinson and Collins providing backup.\nThat is a more manageable and flexible group. Long term, the Knicks would prefer to develop their recent draft picks, Robinson and Collins.\nREBOUNDS\nRon Artest remains a Sacramento King, despite considerable trade speculation. He grew up in Queens. ''It's a little different,'' Artest said of living in Sacramento. ''It's a little slow. It's like living in Long Island, a big Long Island. It's very relaxing and the family loves it.'' ... Artest credited Isiah Thomas, who coached him in Indiana, for developing his offensive game. ''Isiah gave me a lot of confidence,'' Artest said.\nPRO BASKETBALL

The mother, Valerie Bell, said she would continue the vigil for 50 days, the number of bullets fired in the Nov. 25 shooting, or until indictments were filed in the case. Mr. Bell and a group of friends were in a car after his bachelor party when the shooting occurred. Two of Mr. Bell's friends were wounded in the shooting. The officers have said that they thought one of the men in the car had a gun. The five police officers involved have been on desk duty since the shooting. The Queens district attorney, Richard A.

Contractors must still disclose the names of their spouses. Contractors and their family members are still barred from contributing to officials who control state contracts. The law, enacted in response to a state payoff scandal, was set to take effect at the start of the year. The request for an injunction was filed by a securities industry trade group.

1816187	At Service for Ford, a Gathering of Ex-Presidents and Family	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E6DD1130F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	In a moment of presidential empathy, former President George Bush recalled a skill he had learned from Gerald R. Ford: how to handle being ridiculed on ''Saturday Night Live.''\n''I remember that lesson well, since being able to laugh at yourself is essential in public life,'' Mr. Bush said in his eulogy for Mr. Ford today. ''I'd tell you more about that, but as Dana Carvey would say: 'Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent.' ''\nAs the 82-year-old former president imitated his own impersonator, there were only three people in the audience who knew exactly how it felt to be ridiculed, as a sitting president, on late-night television. Former President Bill Clinton responded with a hearty laugh from his seat in the Washington National Cathedral, while former President Jimmy Carter, in a neighboring pew, looked on with a smile. Seated nearby was President Bush, who has been relentlessly skewered by TV comics as well.\nWith Mr. Ford's death last week, the group of living ex-presidents has shrunk to three, down from five in the early 1990s. Since 1994, Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and, now, Mr. Ford have left the stage, while Mr. Clinton has joined the ranks of former chief executives.\nThe dynamic among the ex-presidents is perpetually evolving, as people age, rivalries fade and former political opponents discover they share more similarities than differences.\nThe current club has at its core two presidents in different parties -- Mr. Clinton and the elder Mr. Bush -- who have become companions in traveling and fund-raising for causes around the world. The two at times appear more friendly than the elder Mr. Bush is with his son, or than Mr. Clinton is with Mr. Carter, a fellow Democrat. And today it was Mr. Carter, not either of the Bushes, who accompanied Mr. Ford's coffin back to Grand Rapids, Mich., for burial.\nThough Mr. Ford and Mr. Carter squared off in the 1976 election, they became friends after both were out of office. On a flight home from Cairo in 1981, after the funeral of the Egyptian leader Anwar el-Sadat, they found common ground discussing their presidential libraries.\nSimilar kinship has grown between Mr. Clinton and the elder Mr. Bush, in contrast to the rocky relationship between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Carter. Though the two Southern Democrats are from similarly humble backgrounds, they have been at odds repeatedly over the years.\nIn 1993, Mr. Carter said he was ''very disappointed'' in the Clintons for sending their daughter, Chelsea, to private school rather than public school, as the Carters had with their daughter, Amy. After the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Mr. Carter said he had been ''deeply embarrassed by what occurred.'' In more recent years, the Clinton-Carter relationship has had a tinge of a rivalry, as both men have sought to become global statesmen.\nThe funeral also provided a stage for those thinking about the politics of tomorrow, as well as those of yesterday. Along with the three ex-presidents sat several of those who may aspire to the job, including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio.\nAnd it was a reminder that while the nation elects only the president, the White House becomes home to a whole family whose members have to cope with the spotlight. At the cathedral today, Rosalynn Carter was seen talking intently with Nancy Reagan. One row behind them, Chelsea Clinton spoke animatedly with a fellow Stanford University alumna, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\nTom Brokaw, the former NBC anchor, said in his eulogy that when Mr. Ford brought his family to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, ''he brought the humanity that comes with a family that seemed to be living right next door.''\nFor neighbors of the Fords in Alexandria, Va., from the 1950s until they moved into the White House in 1974, they were in fact the family next door, with four independent-minded children whose public indiscretions Mr. Ford sometimes had to confront.\nHis son Jack admitted in a newspaper interview in 1975 that he smoked marijuana and lived a rowdy bachelor's life. His daughter, Susan Ford Bales, was a headstrong teenager when her father became president and was married for a time to a Secret Service agent who had been assigned to guard the family.\nMr. Ford and Ms. Bales, now middle-aged, walked hand in hand down the center aisle of the cathedral before the service, and each read a passage from the Bible.\nMs. Bales's reading came from James 1:19-25, chosen by the family to help illuminate the former president's humble approach to the bitter times in which he served.\n''Therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness, and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls,'' Ms. Bales read. ''But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves.''

1816190	Bracing for Higher Premiums	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E4DD1130F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	To the mantra of life's certainties, add higher home-insurance rates to death and taxes.\nIncreasingly, buying a vacation home means allotting more dollars to cover insurance premiums, as rates in coastal towns soar and insurance companies move to stop writing policies altogether. Unfortunately, homeowners are left with few options.\nThe real estate market in Florida may have cooled this year but the price for home insurance continues to rise. ''Homeowners are in for sticker shock,'' said Chris Kowalczyk, a founder of HAC Florida, a group that he described as a ''grassroots organization of angry homeowners'' fighting for lower property insurance rates. ''Insurance companies are canceling policies right and left even if you are not in the flood zone or near the water.''\nBut Florida homeowners are not the only ones facing higher rates. Coastal homeowners up and down the Atlantic seaboard and also on the Gulf are finding that coverage is simply getting harder to secure.\nAfter about $38 billion in damages from eight hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, insurance companies are on the defensive. Insurers are removing wind coverage from some plans, not renewing policies and even pulling out of coastal markets altogether.\nCondominiums are not immune to this trend either. Condominium associations, which are responsible for buying insurance, are being hit with rate increases. In turn, the new rates trickle down to condo owners in the form of a special assessment or greater association fees.\nWith the exodus of insurance companies from coastal markets, state run entities have been formed to offer insurance to homeowners if no other option exists.\nCape Cod home buyers may ultimately have to buy their policies from the Massachusetts FAIR Plan, the state's home insurer of last resort. ''It's double the cost of a normal insurance policy,'' said Jack Cotton, a broker at Sotheby's International Realty on Cape Cod. However, Mr. Cotton said that the cost of home insurance has not deterred vacation home buyers, though he now advises his clients to start the insurance search early. ''You can no longer wait until the last minute to get insurance,'' he said. ''You used to call from the closing table but now you have to start the process at least 30 days in advance.''\nCitizens, a state run insurance organization in Florida, will carry out a new set of rules in March that were passed by the Florida Legislature last year. Homeowners who do not make their primary residence in Florida will have to provide four letters of rejection from alternate insurance providers in order to secure a policy or policy renewal from Citizens. ''It's not that hard. There is no one else insuring,'' said Rocky Scott, the public information manager for Citizens.\nAdditionally, if a storm hits the state and Citizens runs a deficit (The corporation estimated that a major storm could result in $16 billion in losses), vacation homeowners could potentially be assessed a fee of up to 90 percent of their annual premium to help cover losses.\nEven without the extra fee, homeowners with coverage from Citizens are facing rising rates. ''We are seeing insurance rates 200 to 300 percent more than a year ago,'' said Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla.\nHigher insurance costs, coupled with increasing property taxes, have only further slowed a sluggish real estate market, said Mr. McCabe. ''It makes Florida look not as affordable for vacation home buyers.''\nThe insurance industry places the blame squarely on mother nature.\nJoseph Annotti, a spokesman for the Property Casualty Insurance Association of America, an insurance trade group, said, ''2004 and 2005 changed everyone's perception of what a normal hurricane season is.''\n''Companies are looking at the amount of capital that they have at risk in coastal areas,'' he said. ''No company is going to put their life on the line.''\nHOME AWAY
1816191	Luring Americans to Spain	2007-01-03	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E6D71130F930A35752C0A9619C8B63	Long neglected as one of Spain's secondary cities, Valencia's role as host of the America's Cup this year and its ambitious efforts to showcase new architecture are enticing an increasing number of expatriates to visit the City of Oranges.\nBritons and Germans have long been enchanted by the region, drawn by the Mediterranean coast, warm weather and the legendary expat enclaves of Benidorm and Alicante.\nIncreasingly Americans, too, are getting a taste for the region's attractions -- the number of visitors from the United States was up 12 percent in 2006 -- although most are content to rent rather than buy, according to Linda Rosell Casanova of Valencia Relocation, who has lived in the region for 36 years.\n''The majority of Americans connected some way with the Cup are coming to stay for a year or two,'' she said. ''Others come for a cultural immersion, some to retire.'' U.S. citizens also are arriving to help run a new NATO base.\nMrs. Casanova actually advises interested Americans to rent for a time, so they can be sure they want to buy here before facing such hurdles as acquiring long-term visas.\nOne American who decided to just go ahead and buy is Joe Neira. Four years ago he sold the family home in Westchester County, north of New York City, to buy a villa in Valencia, ''mostly for the culture change.'' His wife, Lucrecia, was born in Valencia, and he speaks fluent Spanish, so the move was relatively painless, he said.\nThe couple and their two children have settled in a 40-year-old house with a swimming pool in the suburb of L'Eliana, about 15 minutes from the city center. They paid 800,000 euros, or $1.05 million, for the 450-square-meter, or 4,844-square-foot, five-bedroom home.\n''We seem to have bought at the right time, before the rest of the world discovered that this was the last place in Europe where prices where going up,'' Mr. Neira said. ''People have just recently discovered that it's a kind of European Florida here, but with a classic European city on your doorstep, so it's now in demand.''\nMr. Neira points to what he calls the best climate in Europe -- locals say there are at least 300 days of sunshine a year -- and a city that is fast becoming an international center.\nSome of the attention is due to the striking buildings designed by Santiago Calatrava, a native son. His City of Arts and Science project, an award-winning triumph of soaring beams and white steel domes hugged by blue lagoons, was built on one of the city's wastelands six years ago, and has helped put Valencia on the map in much the same way as Frank Gehry's Guggenheim draws crowds to Bilbao, Spain.\nAlso, ''investors saw it was cheap,'' Mrs. Casanova said. ''And money poured into the city in the last couple of years so there has been an artificial rise in prices.''\nBut in tandem with that growth, speculation -- and corruption -- has produced some urban and oceanfront blight.\nPotential buyers also should be aware of Valencia's ''land grab'' rules. Basically, the local law, originally intended to prevent overdevelopment, has a loophole that allows developers to buy land or homes, whether the owners agree or not, and redevelop the property. In some cases, there has been no compensation at all.\nThe European Union has told Valencia to change the law. If there is no action soon, the case will be referred to the European Court of Justice.\nYet, overall, real estate prices are up 300 percent in the last five years, Mrs. Casanova said.\nThe average sale price of residential property is now 270,000 euros, or $355,000, said Graham Hunt, who runs the Valencia Property real estate agency and keeps a blog on Valencia property at valenciacomment.blogspot.com.\nBut the prices, at about 1,900 euros per square meter, or $228 per square foot, are a bargain compared with those in other Spanish cities, like Madrid's 3,717 euros per square meter ($446 per square foot) and Barcelona's 3,482 euros per square meter, ($418 per square foot).\nMr. Hunt said that, ''like the rest of Spain, price rises have slowed a lot in recent months.''\nMany real estate experts have warned that Spain's market is seriously overvalued and, in an end-of-the-year assessment, Deutsch Bank's top market analyst noted that, in Europe, Spain is second only to Ireland in the likelihood of a property crash.\nThe Neiras, however, said they feel confident about their future in Spain -- evidenced by the effort they put into the renovation of their property.\nOnce they completed the purchase, they found themselves with a curious hacienda-in-Amsterdam hybrid of a villa (the previous owners had loved all thing Dutch), so they set about the hard task of renovating.\nMrs. Neira, a fashion designer and interior designer, took charge of the decor while Mr. Neira concerned himself with the building work. They spent tens of thousands of euros on stuccoing the interior walls alone, hiring a local artist to do it all by hand. ''He brought in his students -- mostly Spanish gypsies who worked between bouts of flamenco. It was quite a six months!'' he said.\nRenovations totaled 200,000 euros, or about $263,000 -- a bargain compared to costs in the States, Mr. Neira said.\nBut Mrs. Casanova warned that not all builders can be as charming as their plasterers: ''Builders here need no license'' she said. ''So they could have been selling oranges last week, and most of them were.''\n''You have to be on your guard,'' she said. ''A good lawyer, contact with an architect and good advice are essential.''

A cherished husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather, & founder of the Jack Parker Corporation, Jack was a dominant, highly respected figure in the building industry for many decades. Internationally known for his building and ownership of Le Parker Meridien hotel, he was responsible for a remarkable amount of real estate development throughout the east coast of the United States & beyond. Together with his loving wife, Norma, the Parkers have been active leaders at the Institute since 1967, when Mr. Parker became a member of the Board of Trustees. He served as Chairman of the Building Committee, and was responsible for the construction of the facility that opened its doors in New Hyde Park in 1972. He was appointed Chairman of the Board (1972 -1975) and, in recognition of the great generosity of the Parker family, the Institute was named ''Parker Jewish Geriatric Institute'' in 1988. The Institute's name was later revised to more accurately reflect its renowned specialization in both health care and rehabilitation, and its expanding role in providing care for adults of all ages, a vision exemplary of Jack Parker's steadfast commitment to improve the quality of life. Jack Parker will be missed as a friend and as a leader, but the memory of Jack Parker will forever burn bright as a shining example of how much good can be done by an individual who possesses a keen awareness of humanitarian issues and a profound commitment to philanthropic causes.

The only child of her Shakespearean actor father, C. McLean Savage and mother, Grace Hanna, she'd helped to support the family during the Great Depression by dancing, and during the long subway rides home each night after the clubs had closed, she studied the classics and reveled in the journeys of the mind. Liz went on to dance with Michael Mikhail Mordkin, the Metropolitan Opera Ballet and with Harriet Horne, frequently backing such headliners as Frank Sinatra at the Paramount Theater. Later, encouraged by her husband, Nathan Gross, a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, she became a script supervisor and an officer of Local 161, IATSE, where, together with Barbara Robinson, she became first trustee of its Pension & Welfare Fund. Survived only by her late husband's nephews, Stephen and Harold Gross, and a few close friends, the gifts that she leaves are, appropriately, gifts of the spirit. Liz was a rare human being whose lifelong commitment to humanity, through political and social activism, means that she will be missed by those who knew her and those who did not.

1816224	Accessorizing at the Buena Vista Scrabble Club	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E1DA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	LAST week a winter storm blew into town like a stranger with a bad attitude.\nThe lights flickered. The windows rattled. And as effortlessly as a drunken gunslinger sweeps a bartop full of shot glasses onto the saloon floor, the wind upended all the potted plants on the porch.\nI stepped over the wreckage delicately.\nIt meant nothing to me.\nI was on my way to a Scrabble game.\nMost nights there is a pickup game somewhere on the block. Here on Buena Vista Avenue, we are battling winter by huddling in front of fireplaces, trying to remember whether it's acceptable to add an ''s'' to QINTAR, which as everybody on our street knows is a former coin of Albania.\nWe have kept things neighborly, even on the rare occasion when a player is suspected of furtively consulting the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary between turns before playing, say, PEKAN. (Of course, it's entirely possible that the player in question knew off the top of her head that a pekan is a carnivorous animal, and if so, congratulations on the 21 points, Ella.)\nWe can't help being a competitive bunch. The other night, after the team of Zoe and Jake opened the game aggressively with FLAMBES (101 points), the rest of us congratulated them in tones perhaps best described as falsely hearty.\nAnd it has come to my attention recently that certain players are upgrading more than their skills. At Tina's and Hal's house, I couldn't help admiring a handsome mahogany Scrabble Premier Edition, which came with a cute hourglass timer ($149 at Restorationhardware.com).\n''Birthday gift,'' Tina said, as she played FUG (40 points).\nThe next night I saw the same set at Bruce and Stephanie's house.\n''Hanukkah gift,'' Bruce said, as he scored 39 points with QUOTE.\nSo I was thrilled to find under the tree on Christmas morning my own mahogany Scrabble Premier Edition. After I ripped off the wrapping paper, I gave the lazy susan a spin and started fantasizing about a winter filled with QWERTY (the typist's keyboard), ZEK (a gulag inmate) and triple-triple words stretching across eight tiles.\nBut as I greedily went through the set's compartments -- finally, my own leatherette tile bag! -- something was wrong.\nWhere was the cute hourglass timer?\nMissing.\nAnd the special score pad with matching pencil?\nMissing.\nThe next day I returned the set to a bricks-and-mortar Restoration Hardware store only to face further defeat. The premier edition sets were sold out, and as I didn't have the receipt, my only recourse was store credit.\nSold out?\nThe news was no surprise to John D. Williams Jr., the executive director of the National Scrabble Association.\n''This is our busiest week,'' he said by phone. ''We get more calls than almost any other week of the year for two reasons. One is people who just got a new game for Christmas, and they want to know the rules. The other is settling disputes: 'Honey, I have the man from Scrabble on. He's going to tell you I'm right.' ''\nWith 100 million sets sold worldwide and 40 million so-called leisure players (like the Buena Vista neighbors' group), Mr. Williams said, more people are Scrabble addicts than ever. Players gather regularly for games at more than 200 clubs nationwide affiliated with the association, and the contact information for each is listed at Scrabbleassociation.com.\nFor a game invented by an unemployed architect in the early 1930s (There's an entertaining account of Scrabble history in ''Word Freak'' by Stefan Fatsis, which I also received for Christmas and which costs $10.65 at Amazon.com), Scrabble has come a long way.\n''What urge drives players to buy fancy sets and accessories?'' I asked Mr. Williams.\n''It's like anything, whether you're a Nascar aficionado or an Elvis fanatic,'' he said. ''There's the idea of identity, of being part of a subculture. People love customization, whether it's a vanity license plate or a customized Scrabble board.''\nWhich, by the way, you can buy, at Customscrabbleboards.com, where for $175 to $280 you can have your name painted on a personalized board featuring pinstripes or gold leaf lettering.\nBeyond the mahogany premier edition, there's a whole universe of Scrabble accessories and add-ons. Serious players often buy a set of so-called tournament tiles from sites like Protiles.net, where for $15 to $25 for a set of 100 tiles, you can buy printed tiles on which the letters are silk-screened on plastic (rather than indented in wood) to prevent players from ''reading'' the letters with their fingers when they pick them from the tile bag.\nThis brings me to the custom leather tile bags at Domesticleather.com for $10.95 to $12.95 (''barrel closure available -- call for custom orders'') and custom tile racks, including extralong tournament racks ($11.95 to $14.95 each), at Tileracks.net.\nAnd then there's the electronic Franklin Scrabble Dictionary. It's a little hand-held device (marked down to $27.99 at Restorationhardware.com), which the maker describes at Franklin.com as ''invaluable to players at all levels.''\nOr as Mike Crincoli, a vice president at Franklin Electronic Publishers, explained: ''It has all kinds of crossword puzzle solver features that will improve your game. Type in the letters you have, and it will search for relevant matches. Or enter the letters you see on the board, and a question mark in the spaces where you don't have a letter, and it will tell you the possible words you could make.''\nThe Franklin sounded like an awesome tool. I was thinking of buying one.\n''I just hope my neighbors never learn about its existence,'' I told Mr. Crincoli.\nI hung up. I had a voice-mail message from Stephanie. ''I just found out they still have the premier edition in stock at the Restoration Hardware in Berkeley,'' the message said. ''I thought you'd want to know.''\nIt was a neighborly thing to do. So the next time I see her, I'll definitely mention a tip from Mr. Williams: QI (the Chinese philosophical concept) has been added to the latest edition of the official scrabble players' dictionary. But, QIS? She probably doesn't need to know about that one right away.\nOnline Shopper E-mail: slatalla@nytimes.com

The process can be inconvenient and costly, so in recent years, do-it-yourselfers have started using easy-to-apply waxes and glide-enhancing solutions.\nThese products usually contain a fluorinated additive that helps repel water and decrease friction, making it easier to control speed and maneuver. For the finicky enthusiast, most of them are marketed for specific conditions: a thinner, slicker formula for wet, flat runs, or thicker wax to protect gear from dry snow.\nSome waxes come off almost as easily as they go on, so it's best to apply them throughout the day on the mountain. ''In about two minutes you can make controlling your speed and motion easier,'' said Brad Nelson, the chairman of the National Ski and Snowboard Retailers Association. ''Why not do something so simple that can make an O.K. day of skiing a great one?''\nJESSICA CASSITY
1816226	Free the Mind and Fewer Injuries May Follow	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E1DA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	IN a high school locker room in Worthington, Ohio, Sam Maniar handed a piece of string tied to a washer to each of the field hockey players sitting around him. He told the athletes to use their minds to move the washer from side to side, and he watched as each girl's washer started to swing.\n''By thinking about moving the washer, we send a message from the brain to the nerve receptors in our fingers to move the string attached to the washer,'' said Dr. Maniar, a sports psychologist. ''Most people are in total amazement. I use it show the connection between our thoughts and our bodies.''\nEvery athlete and coach knows that harnessing one's mind can lead to feats of coordination and finesse on the field. But what many are just learning is that taking care of an athlete's emotional health -- and managing stress in particular -- can help prevent injury.\n''The research is there showing that high stress levels do increase the risk of getting injured, but few lay people realize the connection,'' Dr. Maniar said.\nIona MacKenzie, 35, a triathlete and adventure racer in Boulder, Colo., believes that a period of undue tension in 2001 led to her back-to-back injuries. Ms. MacKenzie had just started a highly stressful job in Vancouver, was rowing competitively and was also dealing with a long-distance relationship that was financially and emotionally draining.\n''I'd been rowing for about seven or eight years completely injury free,'' she said. ''But during that year I fractured a rib and soon after that healed, I injured my lower back. Both are fairly common injuries for female rowers, but I don't feel like either would have happened if my body hadn't been so weakened by how much stress I was under.''\nThe American College of Sports Medicine recently issued a consensus statement -- a joint effort by about a dozen sports medicine practitioners, team doctors and sports psychologists -- to inform team physicians, coaches and athletic trainers about the important link between stress and injury.\n''This concept is not always welcomed with open arms in the sports community where athletes are taught to be tough,'' said Dr. Stanley A. Herring, chairman of the consensus statement committee, a team physician for the Seattle Seahawks and a consultant to the University of Washington's sports medicine department. ''But you can't tough your way through mental issues.''\nStress is an omnipresent problem, and the word is used to describe situations ranging from a long wait at Starbucks to fear of a terrorist attack. So why, one may argue, isn't every athlete collapsing to the ground?\nWhile the research has shown a consistent connection between significant negative life events -- the end of a relationship, a death in family, the loss of job, failing in school -- and the increased risk of injury, the key isn't so much the stressful event itself, but how a person handles it.\n''One man's stress is another man's vacation,'' Dr. Herring said. ''Those at risk are the ones whose stress exceeds the resources they have to cope with it.''\nThere are several explanations for how stress leads to injuries. According to Frank M. Perna, a psychologist and associate professor at Boston University, there may be multiple causes. ''Studies have shown that when you're stressed you don't pay enough attention to visual cues,'' he said.\nThat, for example, could cause a football player to miss something in his peripheral vision and be blindsided and injured. Physiologically, more stress means more stress hormones flowing through your body.\nCortisol, a stress-related hormone, decreases the immune response, Dr. Perna said. ''Athletes who are training hard are breaking down muscle,'' he said, ''and cortisol will impede the body's ability to repair muscles, making them more likely to get injured or exacerbate a chronic injury.''\nSTRESS also increases muscle tension, and tense muscles are more susceptible to tearing or can throw a person off balance and affect coordination. Studies have shown that during a single school year, one in six athletes is likely to suffer an injury serious enough to miss games. Other studies have reported that high stress levels make athletes at least twice as susceptible to injury.\nThe key to recognizing athletes at risk, the researchers agreed, is simply bothering to probe deeper.\n''When the athlete gets a preseason physical, it shouldn't be just about the 'physical,' '' Dr. Herring said. ''Ask about what's going on at home, how are things with their girlfriend, do they feel overwhelmed? And if the answers are concerning, it's an opportunity to help them out.''\nDr. Margot Putukian, director of athletic medicine at Princeton University, said, ''Most coaches don't perceive mental health as something they have to worry about.''\nFor coaches who don't have a sports psychologist on call, it is still easy enough to implement some stress-management techniques. Dr. Maniar said there was no reason a coach could not learn a few relaxation tips.\nThe American College of Sports Medicine recommends methods such as progressive muscle relaxation, a sequence of movements to tense and release muscle groups to bring tension levels down. Visual imagery, which involves picturing certain images to create a different physical state, can also be employed.\n''For example, imagining being on a beach in the warm sand is likely to produce a physical shift that makes you feel more relaxed,'' said David B. Coppel, a sports psychologist in Kirkland, Wash.\nAnd doing deep, abdominal breathing helps change shallow breathing (a symptom of stress and tension) into deeper, rhythmic breathing.\nMOST high school and college teams may not be sitting down for group yoga and meditation sessions in place of practice, but a few forward-thinking coaches are already heeding the College of Sports Medicine's recommendations.\nTerri Simonetti Frost, who coaches the field hockey team at Thomas Worthington High School in Worthington, Ohio, brought Dr. Maniar in teach her players imagery techniques. He also encouraged the girls to better communicate about what was causing tension in their lives.\n''Communication is our biggest technique for coping with stress,'' Ms. Frost said. ''If a kid seems off during practice, I'll call her aside and we'll talk about what's going on in her life.''\nMs. Frost gives her players an extra day off each week -- they practice only four days -- to help reduce stress. She also talks to them about their study habits and what is going on in their academic schedules so that they won't feel overwhelmed by school and sports simultaneously.\n''I think on a sort of subconscious level it may play a role in keeping the players healthy,'' she said.\nAlthough it is impossible to prove cause and effect, she noted that none of her players were injured this last season, and the team was undefeated in the regular season.\nThe doctors who put together the College of Sports Medicine consensus statement also said that common emotional reactions to injury -- like loss of identity, fear, anxiety and depression -- could affect a player's recovery.\n''But people who have learned coping strategies for dealing with setbacks in life can better handle the stress of being on the sideline,'' Dr. Perna said.\nStephanie Heinsons, 21, a senior at Ohio State University who competes in equestrian events, regularly practices controlled breathing and imagery to help cope not only with the stress of competition but also with everyday life. ''These techniques help to calm me down and force my focus back into the present,'' she said.\nIf she skips her relaxation techniques, she is more likely to feel anxious and tense up. ''When I take a deep breath and tell myself to focus on the present, I become calm,'' Ms. Heinsons said. ''That helps me like magic.''
1816227	A Store to Make Your Feet Say Olé	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E1DA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	MANY years ago, I lived in Spain for a summer, teaching English at 5:45 a.m. to a group of pharmaceutical executives, most of whom knew only three words in English at the onset of the season: ''yes'' (enthusiastic bobbing of heads), ''no'' (sad frowns) and ''marketing'' (big smiles and thumbs-up gestures).\nEvery day I took the subway to work with the city's construction workers, stopping for a sherry and a coffee (this is what the construction workers did, at least, and I always say, when in Madrid ) and a churro, which considering the Dunkin' Donuts society we live in, might be described as a smaller, lighter bear claw.\nUnfortunately I was the most impatient teacher on the planet -- or maybe it was the 5 a.m. sherry -- and at the end of the summer that remained pretty much the extent of what my students knew.\nEveryone in Spain, I noticed, wore beautiful leather shoes. Like the Italians, the Spanish have a thing for footwear. In SoHo, we now have our own Spanish outpost in the newly opened Té Casan, a 7,500-square-foot emporium for shoes alone.\nThe name of the store comes from the Gaelic phrase for ''a woman's path,'' but that sounds like a self-help book for women going through menopause, so I prefer the Spanish translation. If you don't count the accent on the first word, it translates as ''they marry you,'' and frankly I felt married to at least two pairs of the shoes by the time I left.\nTé Casan, the brainchild of a Spanish entrepreneur, has brought together young designers with experience at Vivienne Westwood, Alexander McQueen, Versace and Dries van Noten, among others.\nThe aesthetic is deeply evocative of Barcelona, a city known for its dripping Gaudí cathedral and avant-garde artistic environment. It's a place where somewhere, any time of year, you can catch a staged version of Ionesco's ''Cantatrice Chauve.''\nThe store's gimmick is that it offers high-quality shoes at relatively inexpensive prices, and it plans to change the merchandise and designs every few weeks. I think $400 to $850 is a lot to spend on a pair of shoes, but in recent years well-to-do American women have been suckered into a bewildering fashion conspiracy.\nTo anyone who looks at Vogue or W, it would appear that in order to be fashionable, to be stylish -- to be, in fact, footwear -- shoes must cost $700. There is something dark about this, as if we have become Stepford Wives, marching off to the high-end shoe brands as if our brains had been sucked out of our skulls and replaced with slots for charge cards. Ka-ching.\nAt Té Casan, the message is change and exclusivity: each style is manufactured in limited numbers, as the salesclerks will eagerly tell you. These editions, according to the company literature, are limited by state. So if a designer makes 80 pairs of the same shoe in size 40, there may be 80 women in New York wearing the same shoe in the same size. Not all that different from other small-scale designers.\nThe heels generally have a more modest cant than your average Jimmy Choo but less of the grandmotherly quality and faux duck-toed modesty of shoes at, say, Anthropologie.\nHAVE you noticed that while models in fashion magazines two decades ago stood with their feet in a proud position, straight forward and elegant, all the models and celebrities now seem to stand with their feet turned inward, knock-kneed as if they were ashamed, or 10 years old? When was the last time you saw a model in the J. Crew catalog standing with her feet straight out?\nThis seems to be part of an ongoing infantilization of the American woman, along with an obsession for weighing 90 pounds. A shoe is a shoe, after all, not a statement of virginity or, perhaps, faux-virginity.\nThis is why I like the shoes at Té Casan so much. They do not force the wearer into a kind of submissive frailty. A designer named Manuela Filipovic did a pair (much photographed in the news media) with a solid heel and Art Deco-esque winged scrolls on either side, in black or green suede -- very 1980s Maud Frizon.\nNiki Robinson, one of the more avant-garde designers at the store, offers flat boots made of leather, fronted with madras patchwork made from men's work shirts, snapped shut with wooden buttons.\nGaetano Perrone's shoes are shaped like pagodas, some with six-inch-wide taffeta bows at the back. There are cherry-red platform pumps with a square toe; evening sandals are made from woven strands of metal. Fay.B's leather boots, plain on the outside with a hint of apricot metallic lining at the top, are $385.\nThe space itself could pass for a chic restaurant. Although it was designed by Ron Pompei, the man behind Anthropologie, it is a cleaner, more space-age gallery. A large central glass staircase is edged with mirrored circles; an open dressing room offers semiprivacy for the serious fetishists -- sorry, I mean fashionistas.\nAfter trying on a dozen pairs, I was surprised to see that the clerk was still remarkably cheerful. To be waited on by a shoe clerk with such patience was as miraculous as if my Spanish pharmaceutical students had learned to recite ''Paradise Lost'' in two short months.\nTé Casan 382 West Broadway (near Spring Street); (212) 584-8000\nATMOSPHERE -- Jetsons meets Arte Povera in an all-white boutique. SERVICE -- As is common with much-publicized new stores, excellent. Time will tell if it remains so. PRICES -- Metallic sneaker bootie, $210; black, gold and cream leather pumps, $245; red patent-leather platforms, $315; flat patchwork madras and leather boots, $425; satin evening sandals with rhinestones, $395. EXTRAS -- Booths for privacy; tea bar downstairs. On two visits the bar was unattended. (Memo to stores: Give it a break; we get our caffeine elsewhere.)\nCritical Shopper
1816228	Dress Their Way	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E1DA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	WHEN self-improvement begins at home, alone, in the closet, it most often ends on the couch, alone, watching television. Fortunately, as marathon viewings of ''What Not to Wear'' on TLC remind us, reforming our errant ways in fashion is best done with professional help, of which there is a sudden outpouring.\nRandolph Duke and Bradley Bayou, onetime designers of the Halston evening-wear label, who now sell collections on HSN and QVC, respectively, have extended their longstanding red-carpet rivalry with new guides to dressing better. Mr. Duke is the author of ''The Look'' (Clarkson N. Potter), with testimonials from Barbra Streisand and Sharon Stone. Mr. Bayou's book is ''The Science of Sexy'' (Gotham), endorsed by Queen Latifah and Paula Abdul. (''Bradley Bayou is the bomb!'')\nMr. Bayou said this week: ''Beyond the stick thin, or the size 6s and 8s, real women don't know what looks good on them. They don't really have an eye. Their friends don't have an eye. That comes with training.''\nMr. Bayou approaches the body as Dan Brown approached Leonardo da Vinci. He developed a formula based on anthropometrical studies of body shapes, with 48 varieties based on a ratio of height and weight and subdivided by silhouette. This approach involves a tape measure and a lot of math, but the rewards include a pitiless dissection of one's peculiar body failings paired with clear-cut advice on dressing around them.\nFor example, if your hips are more than 5 percent wider than your shoulders, you're a triangle. And if you are 5-foot-5 and weigh 175 pounds, you're a Category 7 triangle. Mr. Bayou draws a more graphic picture: You have what's called ''a low balance.'' Your celebrity body double is Kathy Bates. Off-the-shoulder dresses, corseted blazers and chandelier earrings are in order.\nMr. Duke puts the burden on the reader to develop something called ''authentic personal style,'' using a method some may find unsettling. To figure out your body type -- Mr. Duke sees only five -- he recommends beginning with a self-assessment that requires you to stand naked before a mirror with a paper bag over your head.\nHe suggests this will make you more objective, even if it sounds an awful lot like the punch line of a bad joke.\nFront Row
1816229	Skin Deep; The Cosmetics Restriction Diet	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1DA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	DR. FRAN E. COOK-BOLDEN, a dermatologist in Manhattan, is an advocate of skin-care minimalism. When a patient recently arrived for an appointment toting 20 different products she was using regularly -- including an eye cream, a vitamin C cream, a wrinkle serum, a pigmentation cream, a mask, a peel, a scrub and ''some sort of special oxygen detoxifying cream'' -- Dr. Cook-Bolden said she confiscated all but three.\n''It gave me a headache just to look at all of those products,'' Dr. Cook-Bolden said. ''Just two products, a gentle cleanser and a good sunscreen, are enough daily skin care for most people, and you can buy those at a drugstore or a grocery store.''\nDr. Cook-Bolden is part of a back-to-basics movement among dermatologists. At a time when beauty companies are introducing an increasing number of products marketed for specific body parts --including necks, creases around the mouth and eyelids -- or for apocryphal maladies like visible pores or cellulite, these doctors are putting their patients on cosmetics restriction diets.\nThey are prescribing simplified skin-care routines requiring at most three steps: soap; sunscreen every day, no matter the weather or the season; and, if necessary, a product tailored to specific skin needs, whether a cream for pimples or pigmented spots, or a vitamin-enriched moisturizer for aging skin. Each product, they say, can be bought at drugstores for $30 or less.\nAmong those doctors who have become experts at uncluttering their patients' vanity tables and medicine cabinets is Dr. Sarah Boyce Sawyer, an assistant professor of dermatology at the School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n''My New Year's beauty resolution for patients is: cut down on skin-care products and cut your skin-care budget,'' Dr. Sawyer said. ''Cut down on those $100 potions.''\nFor some doctors, simplifying skin-care routines is a way to make patients follow a regimen or a means to soothe irritated skin. But some dermatologists are also suggesting patients use fewer, less expensive products because they believe there is little scientific research to justify buying an armload of pricey cosmetics, Dr. Sawyer said.\n''We have good medical evidence on prescription products,'' she said. ''But the science is fuzzy with a lot of cosmetics.''\nUnlike drugs, cosmetics are not required to prove their efficacy.\nPrescription medications like Accutane for acne and over-the-counter drugs such as sunscreen ingredients must undergo rigorous clinical testing before they gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration. But cosmetics are not subject to the agency's scrutiny before they go on sale. The F.D.A. defines cosmetics as topical products that do not alter the structure or function of the skin.\nDr. William P. Coleman III, the vice president of the American Academy of Dermatology, said consumers should view moisturizers and wrinkle creams as no more than superficial treatments.\n''You have to think of cosmetics as decorative and hygienic, not as things that are going to change your skin,'' said Dr. Coleman, who is a clinical professor of dermatology at Tulane University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans. ''A $200 cream may have better perfume or packaging, but as far as it moisturizing your skin better than a $10 cream, it probably won't.''\nAccording to F.D.A. regulations, beauty manufacturers are responsible for the safety of their cosmetics and for their own marketing claims. Although many beauty companies perform studies on their products, they are not required to conduct clinical trials on the level of medical research or to make their proprietary research available to the public.\nDr. Mary Ellen Brademas, a clinical assistant professor of dermatology at New York University Medical Center, said the paucity of rigorous published science on cosmetics makes it difficult to determine how well creams work, whether they cost $10, $100 or $1,000.\n''People are spending $450 on a jar of cream just because it is made out of something exotic like salmon eggs or cocoons,'' Dr. Brademas said. ''But the cheapest products work just as well as the more expensive ones.''\nA study of wrinkle creams published last month by Consumer Reports concluded that there was no correlation between price and effectiveness. The study, which tested nine brands of wrinkle creams over 12 weeks, also concluded that none of the products reduced the depth of wrinkles by more than 10 percent, an amount ''barely visible to the naked eye.''\nThe Consumer Reports study found, for example, that a three-step regimen of Olay Regenerist products costing $57 was slightly more effective at reducing the appearance of wrinkles than a $135 tube of StriVectin-SD or a $335 combination of two La Prairie Cellular lotions.\n''I am seduced by fancy packaging as much as the next person,'' Dr. Brademas said. ''But I have a theory that all these skin-care things come out of the same vat in New Jersey.''\nJohn Bailey, the executive vice president for science of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, an industry trade group in Washington, said that skin care varies widely in price because of amounts spent on research and development of ingredients and product formulas, and the cost of manufacturing and packaging.\nBut, he said, it is difficult to measure performance differences among products.\n''Cosmetics don't have the same quantitative analysis as drugs, so you don't have a set gauge you can use to determine perceived and actual benefits,'' said Dr. Bailey, who has a Ph.D. in chemistry. ''Ultimately, consumers will have to try products out and find what works best for them.''\nTHE back-to-basics skin-care regimen is based on practicality rather than marketing claims. It does not rely on exotic ingredients grown on far-flung islands hand-picked by natives only under a full moon.\nDr. Diane C. Madfes, a clinical instructor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, said that basic skin care requires washing one's face to remove dirt, sweat and bacteria, and using sunscreen to impede sun damage. People who worry about wrinkles, pimples, dry spots or pores may want to add one or two treatment products, she said.\nDr. Cook-Bolden, who has been a paid consultant for several mass-market cosmetics brands, suggested a mild liquid cleanser for the face. Instead of using toners, which may strip skin, or gritty exfoliation beads and microdermabrasion systems, which may irritate skin, she recommended using a washcloth to slough off dead skin cells.\n''If you have dry, sensitive skin, you just pat the washcloth on your face gently in a circular motion,'' she said. ''If you don't have irritated skin, you can put more speed and pressure on the washcloth.''\nDermatologists disagree whether a moisturizer is then needed. Dr. Brademas said it is superfluous.\n''Moisturizer is optional unless you are in the Arctic,'' said Dr. Brademas, who favors Vaseline petroleum jelly for dry hands, feet, knees and elbows. ''I'm not sure moisturizers do very much except for creating a smooth surface so that makeup can go on without drag.''\nDr. Cook-Bolden took a more agnostic position.\n''If you need a moisturizer, moisturize,'' she said. ''If you want less moisture, use a lotion. If you want more, use a cream. And if you have acne-prone skin, use a gel or a spray.''\nAlthough the dermatologists interviewed for this article disagreed about moisturizer, they agreed on one point: the importance of sun protection, including hats, avoidance of midday sun and the use of an effective sunscreen. They recommended that consumers look for formulas that include ingredients -- like zinc oxide, titanium dioxide or Mexoryl SX -- that impede damage from the sun's longer wavelength UVA rays, a protective effect that is not indicated by a product's SPF rating.\nBeyond soap and sunscreen, Dr. Madfes said that one or two additional products might be added to personalize a skin-care routine.\n''People who see wrinkles around their eyes are going to reach for an eye cream,'' Dr. Madfes said. ''Someone who looks in the mirror and sees large pores may want to use a cleanser with salicylic acid, which can reduce clogged pores.''\nShe is also a proponent of night creams that combine retinol, a form of vitamin A that may help speed up the turnover of skin cells, and antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E or lycopene that may help thwart environmental damage to the skin. People with skin conditions like severe acne or people interested in topical anti-wrinkle drugs should consult their doctors about prescription medications, she said.\nOn an expedition last week to a CVS Pharmacy at Columbus Circle with a reporter, Dr. Madfes examined the product labels on skin-care items from a variety of mass-market brands and recommended a few basic products, including Cetaphil cleanser and La Roche-Posay Anthelios SX sunscreen.\n''Higher end, more expensive products may look better in the box and feel better on your face, but they don't necessarily work better than less expensive products as long as you look for ingredients that are known for efficacy,'' Dr. Madfes said.\nBut she did see one benefit to splurging.\n''The thing is, when someone buys a $200 cream, they are going to use that cream,'' Dr. Madfes said. ''So, in the end, their skin may benefit.''\nDrugstores Bank on Snob Appeal (But Can You Pronounce It?) By NATASHA SINGER\nLUMENE. Lierac. Olí. Arnaud. Proraso.\nNo, these are not race-car drivers competing in the Dakar Rally. They are imported skin-care brands now competing for consumers' attention on the shelves at Target, Walgreens and CVS Pharmacy.\nTo try to attract brand-conscious beauty consumers who are wont to buy their cosmetics at department and specialty stores, drugstore and big-box chains are starting to introduce niche European skin-care lines. These imported products, some of which include retinol, peptides or antioxidants derived from exotic plants, aim to rival prestige brands in formula, texture, packaging and fragrance.\n''You are no longer necessarily getting a better product assortment, better products or better service at a department store,'' said Karen R. Young, the chief executive of the Young Group, a consulting firm for the beauty industry. ''It is a massive leveling of the playing field.''\nIn the last few years, for example, CVS, with 6,200 stores nationwide, has upgraded its cosmetics aisles in 300 stores by introducing beauty departments called Healthy Skincare Centers. The displays are stocked with French skin-care brands like Avène and La Roche-Posay, a line that was previously sold in the United States through dermatologists' offices. The centers are staffed by beauty advisers.\nThese products cost more than mass-market skin care. Janice Jacobs, director of proprietary and limited-distribution brands for CVS, said the chain's most expensive skin-care product now costs about $60, up from about $20 in 1999. ''Consumers are looking for convenience and accessibility,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''If we can give her the tools and the testers of a department store, and the skin-care advice on her terms when she needs it, then she is willing to buy in our stores.''\nLast year, Target created a department called Bath & Body, a range of 20 skin-care brands including Ma Provence, a fragrance line, and Proraso, an Italian shaving line, that are now sold in almost 1,500 stores. Walgreens recently introduced its European Beauty Collection, a group of seven skin-care brands including Institut Arnaud Paris and Skincode, a line from Switzerland. And drugstore.com just added Cléo, a brand made in Italy whose key ingredient is yogurt.\n''The drugstores are saying, 'We are not Saks, but if we have our own Spanish or Finnish brand, we'll attract consumers with our own exclusive products,' '' Ms. Young said.
1816230	To Sleep, Perchance To Succeed	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE1DA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	FOR those who have failed in a decade or three's worth of New Year's resolutions to become better workers, spouses, parents, athletes or lovers, there is a new frontier in personal growth -- or at least a proliferation of products, mostly hawked over the Internet, that promise to help turn the last bit of untrammeled downtime (sleep) into an opportunity for improvement.\nNew health products have emerged, often from the margins of commerce. Old self-help approaches like subliminal ''sleep learning'' have evolved and found new life on the Web.\n''While you sleep!'' has become an Internet marketing catchphrase. The idea plays on two classic, if contradictory, American impulses: the desire to get ahead, and the compulsion to avoid the slightest expenditure of effort.\nThere are diet pills sold under names like Lose and Snooze and Sleep 'n Slim, which contain collagen and which the makers say can help maximize the body's metabolism. There are foot pads from Japan that look like tea bags and promise to drain toxins and restore energy while you sleep.\nOn one Web site, hypnotictapes.com, besides recordings designed to improve public speaking or break addiction to alcohol or heroin, there are programs promising to help you, at least partly while sleeping, ''Overcome Fear of Clowns'' and ''Master the Bagpipes.''\n''The grow-yourself revolution started in the '50s,'' said David Allen, a productivity consultant who wrote ''Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity'' (Viking, 2001), and it ''is the one industry that has never faltered in the last 40 years. All they have done is give you more clever ways of getting it without having to give anything.''\nProducts marketed for nocturnal self-transformation often target outward appearance. Ortho-K contact lenses, which reshape the cornea to correct vision and are typically worn only at night, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. But the claims of many other products are more nebulous.\nNancy Clark, a registered dietician and the author of the best-selling ''Nancy Clark's Sports Nutrition Guidebook'' (Human Kinetics, 2003), said that she had never heard of collagen -- the supposed magic bullet in some nocturnal diet pills -- used as a weight-loss aid. ''If it were true,'' she said, ''it would be front-page news.''\nThe products with perhaps the broadest potential market, and often the most extravagant promises, are designed for so-called sleep learning. Professionals who think the boss has been a little slow with that promotion -- and who have left their skepticism in their other briefcase -- can try to kick-start their careers with the Wealth & Success Power Affirmations subliminal program (''start advertising to your own mind''). Sold through sleeplearning.com, it can be played through stereo pillow speakers available on the same Web site for $29.95.\nNot everyone selling self-improvement while sleeping promises overnight miracles. James Schmelter, a certified hypnotherapist who runs hypnotictapes.com out of San Francisco, said sleep learning on its own is often of only marginal benefit, which is why it is only one of four elements in his hypnosis-at-home programs, many of which he records individually for customers and sells for $98. The other three parts of the program are to be listened to awake.\nHypnosis is generally accepted as a legitimate technique to facilitate other forms of treatment, like cognitive behavior therapy, said Guy H. Montgomery, a clinical psychologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan.\nBut unlike the hypnotized brain, which is receptive to spoken suggestions, the sleeping brain is not so suggestible, said Dr. Michael J. Sateia, the head of the sleep disorders program at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. ''Generally,'' he explained, ''sleep is considered to be a state of being relatively 'offline,' as it were, with respect to extrasensory input.''\nSleep learning is a self-empowerment concept that dates back at least to Aldous Huxley's ''Brave New World,'' published in 1932, but for most of the intervening years it could be found mainly on cassette programs tucked away on self-help shelves in bookstores alongside volumes on astral projection. That all changed with the Internet.\nMarc VanDeKeere, for example, is one seller of sleep-learning self-improvement products who said he has noted a spike in business in recent years. Mr. VanDeKeere, a hypnotherapist who operates the Web site brainwave-entrainment.com, said he had seen sales of subliminal problem-solving and meditation products, which he recommends that customers use while sleeping, increase by a third in the last few years. And he proudly points to 17,000 positive feedback responses for his products on eBay. ''Fifteen years ago,'' he said, ''nobody would be able to find these products.''\nEldon Taylor, the founder of Progressive Awareness Research, a company in Medical Lake, Wash., that has marketed a line of hypnosis CDs to be used awake and asleep under the InnerTalk brand since 1984, said demand has grown noticeably in the last five years. He attributes that growth in part to economic anxieties that have increased people's desire to wring productivity out of the wee hours.\n''How many times do people change jobs?'' asked Mr. Taylor, whose Web site, innertalk.com, offers CDs titled ''Excel in Exams'' and ''Natural Breast Enlargement.''\n''We live in a society full of more information than we can absorb,'' he said, ''but we're required to absorb it, because if we don't absorb it, we fall out'' of the race.\nThis apparent renewed interest in learning while snoozing comes at a time of increased academic research into the topic. Last year, for example, researchers at the University of Lübeck in Germany found that gently stimulating the brain during sleep with an electrical current at a certain frequency improved the ability of test subjects to remember a string of words they had learned before a nap.\nStill, Dr. Jerome M. Siegel, a professor of psychiatry at the Center for Sleep Research at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that most research he has seen indicates that subliminal sleep learning is of little or no value because ''the sound had to actually wake you before you would benefit.'' Dr. Siegel recalled rigging a speaker system under his own pillow in junior high school in a failed effort to learn French. ''Even when you're sleepy, but not asleep,'' he added, ''you don't learn very well.''\nA study in 1992 by the British Psychological Society dismissed the concept of sleep learning, finding that it can ''only occur if the sleeping person is partly awakened by the message.'' But such findings did not kill off interest in the concept and its seductive, something-for-nothing allure.\nFor Candace Kinsella, a retired nurse in Largo, Fla., who wanted to reduce by a few sizes, diet pills were not enough, so she turned to a weight-loss sleep program that is not subliminal, but consists of spoken messages like ''eat more vegetables,'' she said. Despite the potential distraction of someone talking while you're trying to sleep, she said the program, which is sold on the Web site robert-egby.com, is relaxing. ''It's like going to sleep with the TV on,'' she said.\nShe credits it with helping her lose 50 pounds over one year, starting from a weight of 345, simply by providing constant reminders to go to the gym, drink water instead of soda and eat better. ''All of this augments'' a commitment during waking hours to healthy living, she explained.\nThen again, the typical middle-aged American gets as little as 6.1 hours of sleep a night, according to a recent University of Chicago study, instead of the commonly accepted optimum of eight. So people who fail to transform themselves suitably during the wee hours can always fall back on using their sleep to obtain one thing that doctors believe is crucial to a life of happiness and productivity: rest.
1816231	Where You Least Expect It	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0DA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	HAS it ever seemed clearer that fashion is not about clothes? Has it ever appeared more inevitable that the cult of the designer is slated for the cultural slag heap, there to join all those other monuments to the outmoded notion of the grand career (retrospective albums, DVD collections, the Great Novel)?\nFashion, like an awful lot of other stuff in the culture, is cracking apart before one's eyes. You're doomed if you try to see the field as some powerful system run by chic sadists (''Bore someone else with your questions,'' said Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly in ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' snapping at her simpering minion in the weary tone of a burned-out dominatrix).\nFashion doesn't come just from the runway anymore, if it ever really did. And it doesn't come from ''Project Runway'' either. Rather, it seems to happen spontaneously and then spread like some mostly benign contagion, a germ carried in the air and contracted in this store, that magazine, this corner of the city and in ways that fashion bibles rarely bother to note.\nTrends emerge, apparently from nowhere: they are fashion. This process can be intoxicating to watch. Suddenly young people in rock bands like the Decemberists and My Morning Jacket begin dressing as if playing a rock club was no different from running copies behind a counter at Kinko's. In place of stage costumes, they favor cheap sweater vests and no-brand thrift shop jeans. They make such a success of looking frumpy that their frumpiness develops into a style despite itself.\nHow can one tell? Well, already last season in Paris, Sarah Lerfel, a farsighted owner of the celebrated boutique Colette, was talking about a trend that sounded a lot like the Return of Grunge.\nFashion in that sense is a Möbius strip, a flexible circuit, both variable and closed. Designers shine one season on the face side of the loop, the arc turns and suddenly you can't see them anymore. A year ago the name of Roland Mouret -- a self-taught son of a French butcher, holder at some point of most every job there is in fashion (stylist, model, gofer, art director) -- was on everyone's lips. The hobbled skirts and elevator stilettos he promoted in the fall of 2005 were greeted by some as precisely the antidote to a sartorial landscape grown neutral and drab.\nIt was meant to happen in a big way for Mr. Mouret. The fix was in at Vogue. And then well nothing. A couple of movie people were spotted wobbling down that purgatorial road to nowhere, the red carpet, in his creations. Some stores, like Bergdorf Goodman, bought the collection. Yet the predicted breakout did not take place; the gyre turned and Mr. Mouret faded away. Until late this November, when, with hardly any fanfare, there he was again, proudly adorning the racks at the Gap. The Gap?\n''I was interested in the opportunity to make my designs available to a broader audience,'' the designer said, after a small capsule collection of his was shipped to select local Gap stores, including one on 17th Street in Manhattan, where the actress Lucy Liu was caught waiting with an armload of $88 tunic dresses outside a dressing room. (They quickly disappeared.)\nWas Mr. Mouret selling out? He was not. He was just doing what every designer from Stella McCartney to Karl Lagerfeld to Vera Wang has recently done, buying his ticket to board the mass-market gravy train. As it happens, this is a fine thing that has happened to fashion, since the democratization of design is a value that has been trumpeted by every theoretician of the applied arts since the Bauhaus.\nIt is thrilling somehow to see visual ideas first created to be pitched to the rarefied tastes of a group of mandarins leak out to the broader population. It is a pleasure to realize that our tastes, after all, are not formed at the whim of some underfed dictators of editorial chic. And there is a lot of fun to be had in tracking the serendipitous way that cultures, both high and low, unexpectedly collide.\nThink of how hipsters have suddenly started looking like Paul Bunyan. Think about how the grizzled, bearded look now affected by half of Williamsburg this winter was only a short time ago derided as an affectation of gay bears, a small minority of hyper-masculine men who affect potbellies, clodhoppers and lavish chin whiskers.\nWe are talking full shrubs here, not mangy soul patches, the kind of beards that gay bears once seemed to be the only ones to flaunt (the better to attract each other at bars and roundups like the annual Bearapalooza or the Furball in Canada).\nIs it because atavism runs deep in fashion that the style abruptly leaped across the population boundaries and has now made a startling appearance among the ranks of cool young men, mostly straight?\nIn the late summer of last year, one spotted a scant few beards around town; then, come autumn, whole blocks of the Lower East Side were crawling with guys who looked like the musician Devendra Banhart, who in turn seemed to have copped his look from Peter Orlovsky, the poet lover for three decades of Allen Ginsberg, the late literary genius who, after his first visit to India, affected a beard woolier than anything you'd see on a mud daubed sadhu.\nBy this past holiday season, whether at clubs and bars like Supreme Trading or Black Betty in Brooklyn, the bearded hipster-mullah-hippie look had proliferated to the point where one could barely distinguish musicians from the local Hasidim. (In the case of the popular rapper Matisyahu, an Orthodox Jew, the distinction was moot.)\nShifts of taste and style are trivialities, of course, without any serious meaning. But they do perform one important function, as Proust pointed out: they notch our hours and moments and decades and leave us with visual mnemonics, clues by which to remember where and in which dress and what jeans (and wearing what cologne) one was at a particular time. Tracking the way styles evolve gives us insight, too, into the forms of beauty we choose to idealize.\nModels who were vacant optimistic cheerleader types prevailed in the politically clueless 1970s (Christie Brinkley, Patti Hansen, Shelley Hack); brooding brunettes took over during the Age of Reagan (Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford and Yasmeen Ghauri); and off-kilter aristocratic types (Guinevere van Seenus, Stella Tennant, Erin O'Connor), emblematic of upper class women, came to the fore during the second Bush imperium.\nWhat fashion now prefers as a beauty ideal is another type, the robot, personified by the stunning Raquel Zimmerman, a blond Brazilian of German heritage whose physical proportions are so symmetrical that many designers use her body as a template. That Ms. Zimmerman also has a kind of vacant cyborg aspect cannot be altogether incidental. Possibly this is the reason why Louis Vuitton hired her for a new ad campaign in which her face has been made up and manipulated so aggressively as to render her less humanly expressive than Lara Croft.\nWas this intentional? Who knows? But it is no stretch to extrapolate from Ms. Zimmerman's popularity to a time when live models will be dispensed with altogether, in favor of creatures written in CGI. That is not to suggest there is a master plan. There rarely is. Or is there?\nThe guessing game keeps fashion fun for observers, that and its magpie habit of plucking from the cultural grab bag anything bright or unexpected with which to keep us amused.\nI am thinking of a microfad recently noted among privileged young women in elite neighborhoods of the Upper East Side, the wearing of bedroom slippers on the streets. ''It started at boarding schools two years ago, when every single boarding-school kid was wearing them,'' Signe Conway, a senior at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, explained last week, as she stood outside Yura & Co., a coffee shop that doubles as a private neighborhood clubhouse.\nMs. Conway, 17, was wearing a pair of fuzzy suede moccasin-style slippers, the sort lined with shearling and with a roll of fur turned down on each side. The slippers are sold by L .L. Bean; they caught on when girls' school administrators banned the wearing of the now ubiquitous Ugg boots.\nLike flip-flops in January, slippers on the sidewalk flout logic. They blur lines. They catch the eye and jolt one into the subtle realization that boundaries between public space and private are permeable. The gesture is small but it reminds one that fashion is a monumental system built on coded details.\nIf one suddenly decides to colonize the sidewalks and treat them as though one were home in the bedroom, it is fashion that issues the license to proceed.\nFashion Diary
1816232	Pondering Six Diamonds and Contemplating the Other Table	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E0DA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The premier event at the Edgar Kaplan Winter Regional in Midtown Manhattan, which finished last Saturday, was the Truscott Board-a-Match Teams.\nIgor Milman, Oleg Rubinchik, Albert Shekhter and Yuri Yurachkivsky of New York; Victor Melman of Scarsdale, N.Y.; and Michael Prahin of Irvington, N.Y., won the event. They finished just over three points (three boards) ahead of Robert Heitzman Jr. of Suffern, N.Y.; Walter Lee of Framingham, Mass.; Aviv Shahaf of New York; and Jonathan Weinstein of Evanston, Ill. Third were Jeff Aker of Briarcliff, N.Y.; Barry Rigal of New York; Bruce Rogoff of Upper Grandview, N.Y.; and Michael Rosenberg of New Rochelle, N.Y.\nThe winners gained one point on the diagramed deal from the final session.\nBoth Wests made a disciplined pass on the first round, not wishing to open two spades when holding four cards in the other major. But after South opened one diamond in the fourth position, each West overcalled two spades. Both Norths responded three diamonds.\nNote that you are permitted to ''overbid'' a tad when an opponent makes a weak jump overcall. The basic rule is that you may bid one level higher than you would have in an uncontested auction. Here, North's three-diamond response promised the values only for a respectable single raise.\nIn the given auction, when East passed, Shekhter (South) cue-bid three spades. Yurachkivsky (North) assumed that this was asking for a spade stopper, so he bid three no-trump. But when South continued with four clubs, it changed the meaning of three spades from a western cue-bid (Partner, I want to be in three no-trump if you have a stopper in the opposition's spade suit) to an advance cue-bid (Partner, I am interested in a diamond slam and have first-round controls in spades and in clubs). After North showed his first-round heart control, South jumped to six diamonds.\nWest led the spade queen, promising the king as well, which declarer ruffed.\nThis is an interesting declarer-play problem. In a knockout team match scored by international match points, when overtricks are unimportant, the best line would be to cash the diamond ace, then, if the king did not drop, to play on clubs, planning to discard two hearts from the board and eventually to ruff South's second heart in the dummy. And declarer has the heart finesse available should the clubs break 5-1.\nBut in board-a-match, overtricks can be vital. You receive one point for scoring more total points on a board than your opponents (and half a point for a tie). If at the other table South was in six diamonds making seven, Shekhter's team would score nothing if he made the contract exactly. But Shekhter realized that trying to get into the dummy to take the diamond finesse was not without risk.\nIt was also possible his opponents would not reach slam. And West might have a singleton diamond king. So Shekhter adopted the best line for his contract, cashing the diamond ace at Trick 2. He played off his three top clubs, discarding one heart from the dummy, ruffed a club on the board, trumped a spade in his hand and threw dummy's heart queen on his last club. East took the diamond king, but that was all.\nWhat happened at the other table? After North raised to three diamonds, Rubinchik (East) bid three hearts. This was fit-showing, promising spade support and four or more hearts with at least one of the top three heart honors. (Normally East would have longer and stronger hearts, but he had not opened one heart in the third position.)\nNow South was worried that he had two fast heart losers and that perhaps the opponents could do very well in a major. (Note that six spades doubled costs only 1,100, a good save against six diamonds.) So South jumped to five diamonds. This was passed out, Milman (West) deciding not to bid five hearts. Declarer took all 13 tricks for plus 640, but the winning team scored the point on the board for plus 1,370.\nThe District 3 Winter Regional takes place Tuesday through Jan. 15 at the Hilton Rye Town, Rye Brook, N.Y.

1816233	Childhood Friends, Partners in Crime	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E0DA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Blade Itself By Marcus Sakey 307 pages. St. Martin's Press/Minotaur. $22.95.\nMarcus Sakey is a first-time author who successfully jump-starts his first book, ''The Blade Itself.'' He does this with a nod to Dennis Lehane's ''Mystic River,'' which is never a bad gambit for a hard-charging thriller. So Mr. Sakey presents a group of young Irish guys from the Old Neighborhood (in this case on the South Side of Chicago). He describes a crime committed in their shadowy past. And he guarantees that the crime will come back to bite them.\nEvan McGann is the story's loose cannon. He's the one who turns a pawn-shop robbery into something worse. And he implicates Danny Carter, the book's basically clean-cut hero, in the process. Thanks to Evan's sadism, which will endure for 300 pages' worth of threats and mayhem, the robbery turns deadly. Evan goes to prison, but Danny goes free, and don't think Evan isn't touchy about that.\nYears pass, but not enough of them. Evan gets out early for (here's some irony) good behavior. This gives him license to stalk Danny and to regale him with the kinds of ugly prison-life stories that do not bode well for the old friends' future dealings. Sure enough, Evan is in ''You owe me, Danny'' mode and has hatched a revenge plot. ''I just thought of a way to get rich and even at the same time,'' he explains.\n''The Blade Itself'' is tight and propulsive in these early stages. But now Mr. Sakey must come up with an interesting plot device that can sustain the rest of the novel. So he exploits the facts that Danny has prospered during Evan's absence, and that both of them remain creatures of the Old Neighborhood through and through. This fills Danny with self-doubt and troubling questions. ''Was he just a thief with a better address?'' asks the book, now that Danny embraced respectability and moved to the North Side.\nHow much complexity can ''The Blade Itself'' attach to that question? Not as much as Mr. Lehane could, but Mr. Sakey gives it some subtlety. To its credit this is not the kind of book in which straight-arrow, innocent Danny is caught up in a web of lies and accusations. Danny's not squeaky clean, and he's not stupid either.\nBut he has tried his best to change. And now he has a lot at stake: a good job with a construction company and a girlfriend who will ditch him if he relapses into crime. For these good reasons Danny is quietly horrified when Evan decides on a kidnapping scheme. The victim is to be the son of Danny's boss.\nAs these pieces fall into place, ''The Blade Itself'' falls too: it begins lapsing into the familiar and turning overly cinematic. Thus Danny talks to the ghost of his decent, blue-collar father (who never would have wanted to see Danny side with the construction company's owner against its employees). And we have a ''Scream'' mask alert, because one of the book's suspense sequences takes place on Halloween.\nMr. Sakey's background becomes more and more germane as his book unfolds. He has spent 10 years in advertising and marketing, learning how to use the kinds of bold strokes that become increasingly frequent here. And he's been reading some of the usual suspects: Mr. Lehane, George Pelecanos, Elmore Leonard, James Crumley and James Ellroy are among the group of estimable writers he admires. Like them he can construct a story that delivers a kick and leaves no loose ends. But his voice is a clever amalgam. It is rarely his own.\nSecondary characters in ''The Blade Itself'' are familiar but well used. There is Sean, the childhood friend of Danny and Evan, a guy who is now a suspicious cop and is none too impressed with Danny's newfound respectability. There's also Patrick, the loyal buddy with the tough-guy attitude. (His answering machine greeting: ''This is Patrick. Give me one good reason to care that you called.'') Patrick's function in the book, aside from being able to sense the truth about Evan, is to convince Danny that Evan is even more horrible than he seems.\nThere's also Karen, the girlfriend who will inevitably be stalked and threatened during the course of the story. Karen brings out the best in Mr. Sakey, which is a streak of tenderness that gives the book some warmth. She can also bring out the worst, a penchant for one-sentence paragraphs signaling suspense:\n''What if he went home and told her the truth?''\n''Would she understand?''\n''Would she leave?''\nFortunately, there aren't many of these.\nBut they are never any good.\nUnless someone like Mr. Leonard is writing them.\nBy the end of ''The Blade Itself,'' Mr. Sakey has also become reminiscent of Joseph Finder, another well-versed thriller writer who specializes in revealing cracks in the McMansions of seemingly successful business types. As Mr. Sakey takes Danny apart and looks to see what the man is really worth, the novel delivers some implicit social commentary about the shaky foundation on which Danny's new life has been built.\n''The Blade Itself'' does keep this subject suspenseful: not until the very end of the story is it clear who Danny is or where he stands. His ability to churn these questions so vigorously will bring Mr. Sakey attention and give him a toehold among the crime writers he admires.\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES
1816234	A Crop of Azure, Scarlet and Gold	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E0DA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	A FEW years ago, when I first glimpsed the azure wing of a bluebird in the hedgerow that borders my meadow, I could hardly believe my eyes.\nEastern bluebirds all but disappeared from my farm in central Maryland decades ago, their numbers reduced by pesticides and habitat loss. But now that farmers are cutting back their use of poisons and, thanks to government subsidies, turning some of their cropland into native grasses and trees, the bluebirds are coming back.\nSo are other birds. Just the other day, I was startled to see a pileated woodpecker drilling for insects in my old pear tree. Another day, a fat cinnamon-colored Carolina wren alighted on the railing outside my kitchen, chirping furiously.\nAnd the bluebirds are no longer the shy denizens of the trees that edge the meadow. One pair, and then another, took up residence in the cavities of two old black locust trees that line the lane that passes by our loft, which was built out of an old haymow in the barn.\nI was standing in the kitchen, looking out the window, when I noticed one of these birds flying down from the tree and across the field, with that curious dipping motion I've grown to recognize as that of a bluebird in flight. But there was something else that made me certain it must be a bluebird: It was one of those gestalt moments that birders talk about -- like that indefinable something that tells you that a figure walking on the beach in the distance is your brother, even though he is much too far away to see his face.\nI thought I saw a flash of blue, too, but then again, I told myself, maybe that was wishful thinking. So I grabbed my binoculars, which I keep handy on the counter, and waited.\nTwo birds flew back up the field soon enough with that same dipping rhythm, and one of them landed on the broken branch of a locust tree about 30 feet from my kitchen window.\n''Please, please, don't go away,'' I chanted as I clumsily tried to find the bird with the binoculars.\nAfter several tries, I spotted him: a male bluebird with a satiny round head of the most sapphire blue and a rusty red breast, so close my heart was pounding.\nI don't consider myself religious in any conventional sense. But that bluebird brought me closer to the sacred than I've ever been. Maybe it has something to do with loss and return.\nAt any rate, the male and his mate made their nest that spring in a cavity in one of the old trees. Another pair set up house in a different tree, about 50 feet away. Those black locusts, planted by my grandfather more than a hundred years ago, are full of hollows, perfect for bluebirds.\nI watched the birds coming and going all spring, pecking insects out of the vegetable garden, as I turned over the cover crop and planted greens, sweet corn and huge patches of sunflowers and zinnias. By late summer, I was watching fuzzy fledglings teetering on the tall weeds growing up beneath the trees.\nI realized that my various plantings over the years -- the roses, now laden with rose hips, the Alpine strawberries nestled in a nearby garden, the elderberry bushes next to the wild cedar and mulberry trees, the blackberry canes I let ramble, for their delicious fruit, in the old barnyard -- were beginning to accumulate into a bona fide bird habitat.\nJust as important, the things I had never gotten around to doing -- cleaning up the brush pile, pruning the overgrown forsythia, pulling the wild grape out of the Gold Flame lonicera -- were enhancing that habitat.\nAll this mess was providing the wildlife with cover, insects, fruit and seeds. I kept meaning to cut back the poison ivy that scrambled up the locust trees again this summer, but it got away from me -- and produced a bumper crop of fruit for the birds.\nWhen I decided not to mow the weeds beneath the locust trees, the birds feasted on the purple berries of the pokeweed, the seeds of the asters, foxtail, goldenrod, chickweed and Indian grass.\nAnd thank goodness I didn't cut down the old pear tree.\n''It's blocking your view of the curving fields,'' a landscape architect friend had pointed out last summer. ''And you never eat the fruit.''\nIt was true. It hadn't been pruned in years. The pears were full of worms.\n''But the cardinals love to perch in the branches,'' I said.\nAnd then, when this magnificent woodpecker showed up to feast on the insects in our neglected tree, I felt right with the world.\nI looked up pileated woodpecker on my new favorite Web site, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (www.birds.cornell.edu) by clicking on ''All About Birds'' and then ''Bird Guide,'' and selecting the name from the drop-down list.\nThere he was, my goliath: a 16- to 19-inch bird with a red crest and a white stripe extending beneath his eye and down his neck and black shoulders. He was probably eating ants, I learned from this site. And he and his mate would probably stay around all winter.\nThen, I clicked on ''listen to the song of this species'' and was treated to a series of high-pitched squeaks that built to a crescendo, followed by the thunk-thunk-thunk sound of the drumming of his beak.\nWhen I looked up Eastern bluebird, I was able to see that the juvenile's blue feathers are speckled with white. I had thought so, from my own observations last summer, but the little ones never sat still for long.\nThe Eastern bluebird's song is a series of musical whistles and ''dry chatter,'' as the guide puts it, and I played it over and over again, staring at the various pictures of male, female and juvenile. Next spring, when I hear that chatter, I may recognize it as a sign that the bluebirds have returned.\nThe Carolina wren, I was happy to find out, is here to stay.\nIt is possible to spend days on this Web site, not only learning the calls of birds and what they look like, but also watching videos -- of a robin eating berries in a cedar tree, for instance -- and surfing through cover-girl images of must-have shrubs for birds (bayberry, staghorn sumac, winterberry and viburnum).\nWhat can I say? I'm in love with birds. I want to be able to recognize them by their calls when I'm walking through the woods. I want to plant everything they like, for food and shelter.\nSo be careful if you pick up a pair of binoculars and focus them clumsily on some blurry thing you think you see on a branch. You may lose yourself in a very different kind of garden from the one you thought you were making.\nIN THE GARDEN

Something is wrong when scraping honeycomb candle wax off the bathtub is a justifiable household chore, and (what's worse) evidence that one is living well, since everyone knows that ''me time'' is nothing without bathroom atmospherics.\nWho is Dan Ho to blind us with such wisdom? He's the latest, coolest avatar of lifestyle bliss. You haven't heard of him? He's revolutionary. On ''The Dan Ho Show,'' which starts tonight on Discovery Health Channel, he's making war on our cluttered, overdecorated, unspontaneous lives. Those that are governed by bed ruffles, iPod accessories, closet systems from the Container Store and wall-mounted bronze ampersands from Pottery Barn.\nHe styles himself the antiguru, the anti-Martha Stewart, the anti-Rachael Ray. And his is the war to end all wars.\nMr. Ho's wisdom about the wax comes not from his uneven but winning show, but from the accompanying book, ''Rescue From Domestic Perfection,'' in which he chronicles his own descent into wax-scraping slavery and perfectionism -- he owned a restaurant and a showpiece house and garden in Chicago -- and his eventual liberation from it.\nOf course, like so many reformers in politics and religion, Mr. Ho looks an awful lot like the next despot. Sure, his style isn't peonies and mango coulis (or it's not anymore), but he's hardly less doctrinaire. Mr. Ho, who is originally from Guam, hates middlebrow stuff and loves antiques and anything one-of-a-kind.\nHe likes incongruities too, like big plastic roses in fancy vases and afghans on chic sofas. This shtick, the more you think about it, seems even more daunting than the by-the-numbers pedantry of Ms. Ray and Ms. Stewart, since Mr. Ho is all about je ne sais quoi, which he calls by a Chamorro verb, ''gai.''\nGai, pronounced guy, isn't easy to come by. It's not a product of money or elbow grease. It's one of those savoir-faire things. If you're uptight or uncool or conformist, you can't get there from here.\nAnd yet Hoism exerts a powerful allure. On his hourlong how-to show Mr. Ho takes his message of lifestyle freedom to the people. Be yourself, he says helpfully. No more makeovers, fussy dinners, clattery storage boxes, ad-hoc cooking devices or time-obliterating estates. You have nothing to lose but your $3,000 cedar trees and sushi plates.\nOr so he tells the styleless souls who appeal to him for counsel. He doesn't want them to be cowed by the notion that keeping house is a 24-hour-a-day siege, or that entertaining requires the doting staff, Ativan stash and capacity for risk of a Broadway producer.\nAlas, typically, his flock don't come to him with Balenciaga bags, mammoth cars and a schedule overfull with yoga and reupholstering. That would have been cool. He might have undone them, turned them into tatterdemalion antiques-and-kitsch types in studio apartments; that's his current ideal. (Mr. Ho now lives in a small space in Manhattan, colorfully, but with very few possessions.)\nDisappointingly, his clients are square. They're also short on funds and personality. He tells them to loosen up and use their tables as benches. He also tells them it's O.K. to serve big sandwiches at parties, or trim hedges for exercise. They seem plenty grateful, but what they get is hardly a revelation, and there's not enough conflict.\nIn the end it might be more exciting to see him wrest scented candles from the hands of vanilla addicts. Or deface sisal rugs and Ansel Adams prints with a Sharpie. Or perhaps his show could just be called ''Arson With Dan Ho.'' I'd watch that.\nThe Dan Ho Show\nDiscovery Health, tonight at 9, Eastern and Pacific times; 8, Central time.\nProduced by the Discovery Health Channel.\nTELEVISION REVIEW
1816236	Beware the No. 2 Fighter With a Fierce Mission	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05EFDA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	''Afro Samurai,'' a friend said recently, picking up the DVD from my desk. ''Cool.''\n''Afro Samurai,'' he said again.\n''Cool,'' he said again.\nThe new animated five-part series on Spike TV, which starts tonight, has a strong title. And Samuel L. Jackson is the voice of the main character, Afro, who's seeking revenge on Justice (Ron Perlman), who killed his father. So it locks in an audience right there.\nBut like much anime, even the new Americanized anime, ''Afro Samurai'' seems arcane from the start. It takes place in a black-orange post-apocalyptic landscape, overseen by an enormous statue of the Buddha. Sensibilities clash early on as Christian gravestones emerge from the desertlike earth. A lithe, handsome giant in hoop earrings, a karate headband and a flyaway Afro appears for a showdown with some sibilant bad guy who says, ''I've been waiting a very long time for thissss.'' The showdown starts off all Kurosawa, with swords and solemn words, but soon turns ''Superfly,'' with guns and funk.\nOh, also, the giant with the earrings, who dies, has a little son. The lisping man, whose lily-white midsection is displayed at length -- that's Justice -- tells the boy, ''You will be consumed with hatred for me.'' And he is indeed, drying his tears long enough to vow his revenge and kick off the drama.\nThere: you're in the club. Afro's prime directive is in place. And, if you want to go deeper, Spike TV has conceived some elegant multimedia options. For more of the wavy, bruise-colored anime created by Takashi Okazaki and produced by Mr. Jackson, and to get straight on the characters and plot points, I tuned to the Web site, afrosamurai.com.\nEntering the site requires typing in a birth month and year -- the site suggested ''1969''-- and the tough security made the whole enterprise seem even more thrilling. For sure ''Afro Samurai'' is not for the faint-hearted. It's about swords, guns, machines, thugs and monks, y'all.\nLittle Afro grows into a man who looks very like his late father, and he regularly encounters the ironically named Justice, who is none other than the No. 1 fighter in the world. Afro is No. 2.\nInterestingly, ''No. 2'' is a fierce theme in Japan these days, with some arguing that ceding first place in sectors of the world economy is the smart thing to do. Afro's second-place role is much-discussed in ''Afro Samurai,'' but whether he'll turn it into an asset -- or merely defeat No. 1, old school, and take the top slot himself -- remains to be seen.\nThe atmospherics in ''Afro Samurai'' -- the mist, hazy glows, reflections, disparate light sources, shadows and plays of color on water -- are mesmerizing. The palette is limited but superb: smoky like overdone eye shadow, with hot flashes of candlelight and vast cold walls of translucent ice. New forms of animation do well rendering temperature, better even than live-action television. (Partly it's that they can show frosty breath and inclement weather without using snow machines or losing days of shooting.)\nWhat's missing is flesh, faces and mouths that move convincingly. I'd love to see the peerless animation artists from Studio Gonzo work as meticulously on the palettes and lineaments for the faces as they do on swords and cliff sides. Flesh needs variety and unevenness, and mouths need to move like human mouths -- not like robots, or like stilted stop-action cartoons of old. ''Afro Samurai'' is excellent. But an atmospheric anime series like it, with a similarly front-loaded plot, and with characters that (for once) look human: that would be unprecedentedly cool.\nAfro Samurai Spike TV, tonight at 11, Eastern and Pacific times; 10, Central time.\nCreated by Takashi Okazaki; Leo Chu, Shinichiro Ishikawa, Samuel L. Jackson, Arthur Smith, executive producers; Chihiro Kameyama, executive producer for Fuji Television; Koji Kajita, Taito Okiura, producers; Eric Calderon, co-producer; Nobutaka Kasama, animation producer; Hiroya Iijima, character design/chief animation director.\nWITH: Samuel L.

Such is the concept behind the Pod Hotel, which is opening on East 51st Street in stages this month, with rooms becoming available as they are completed.\nFormerly the Pickwick Arms, a drab Midtown lodging, the Pod Hotel holds 347 rooms barely larger than walk-in closets. A 100-square-foot hotel room for two may be a tough sell, even in New York. But the owners are betting that guests (target age: 18 to 25) will overlook the cramped quarters if they offer high design at a low price. Rates start at $89 a night for a compact single room, above left, made for the traveler who just wants to dive into bed.\n''Our guest is the stylish spendthrift,'' said Richard Born, a principal of BD Hotels, which also owns Manhattan hotels like the Maritime and the Mercer.\nThe Pod Hotel is the first of its kind to open in the United States, though capsule hotels have operated in Japan for more than two decades. The stripped-down easyHotel opened in London in 2005, and the chain has since spread through Europe and Asia.\nVanessa Guilford, the Pod Hotel's designer, has echoed transportation's efficient use of space. Bunk beds suggest sleeper cars on trains, and in rooms without bathrooms, a symbol above the door turns green when a shared hallway bathroom is vacant -- a detail borrowed from airplanes. Flip-down coat hooks are the same as those found on Amtrak trains.\n''The idea was to keep it all cheap and cheerful,'' Ms. Guilford said, ''and to simplify it as much as possible.'' In the lounge, above right, a mural by James Rizzi sets the tone. The Pod Hotel is at 230 East 51st Street. For reservations, (212) 355-0300.\nMICHAEL CANNELL\nCURRENTS: HOTELS

Ms. Wilson, a producer with the Audio Renaissance publishing company, wanted Mr. Wyman, the reader, to give the word more stress in a sentence that began, ''Ethnic Samaritans, now living in northern Israel ''\nThat same afternoon, in a studio a few blocks away, another reader, Julie Fain Lawrence, was recording ''Simply Sexy,'' a steamy Harlequin title by Carly Phillips.\nMr. Kidder and Mr. Oppenheim's philosophical musings might, at first blush, appear to have little in common with Ms. Phillips's bodice-ripper. But the two audiobooks share something that was unheard of a decade ago: they are both being released exclusively in a downloadable format.\nWhen finished next month, they will not exist in CD form but will be available only to mouse-clickers on Audible.com, one of several Internet sites featuring digital audio versions of books, periodicals and spoken-word content.\nUnlike onscreen e-books, which never quite caught on, downloadable audiobooks have taken off, driven by the explosive popularity of the iPod.\nAccording to the Audio Publishers Association, downloads have grown sharply, rising to 9 percent of audio book sales in 2005; that is a 50 percent increase over the previous year. Audible .com, which pioneered downloadable audio books nine years ago, also sells them through iTunes and Amazon and has a membership model similar to that of NetFlix; its membership has grown 54 percent over the last year, to 345,200. Going exclusively to a downloadable format saves publishers the expense of duplication, packaging and distribution. And the savings are often passed along. Audible's full-price version of ''The Audacity of Hope'' by Barack Obama costs $20.97 (although various discounts are available), while the CD version retails for $29.95; undiscounted, unabridged versions of Michael Crichton's ''Next'' are $34.97 by download and $49.95 on CD.\nBecause of lower production costs, titles that a few years ago would not have had audio versions at all are now being recorded; the decision is based largely on projected hardcover sales. And if they prove popular enough as downloads, some of those productions will eventually be made into three-dimensional audiobooks.\nThe audio versions of Anthony Bourdain's ''Kitchen Confidential'' and the New Yorker writer Susan Orlean's ''Orchid Thief'' were both first available only to downloaders. Only after both hardcovers performed well -- Ms. Orlean's book was made into a movie (''Adaptation''), and Mr. Bourdain's inspired ''A Cook's Tour,'' his celebrity chef show on the Food Network -- were both books rolled onto CDs.\nIn 2002, when ''Three Junes'' by Julia Glass was published, ''we hadn't originally bought audio rights and we didn't plan to,'' said Madeline McIntosh, publisher of Random House Audio Group. ''Then in the 11th hour, word came through that the book had been selected for the ''Today'' show book club and was going to get a lot of visibility.''\nThe publisher scrambled to record the book and put it on Audible. It sold on the site exclusively until a year later, when Random House released a physical version of the audiobook concurrent with the paperback.\nWith virtually no promotional budgets, audiobook publishers rely on riding the coattails of the print version's publicity, marketing and advertising. (Book ads increasingly include ''Also available as an audiobook,'' which audio publishers, protractedly battling the belief that listeners are readers' intellectual inferiors, consider a breakthrough.) So while the success of a download-only title on Audible.com is a factor in determining whether to release a CD, publishers still link that decision more closely to hardcover sales.\nTwo Penthouse magazine books, ''Between the Sheets: A Collection of Erotic Bedtime Stories'' and ''26 Nights: A Sexual Adventure,'' were released in download-only audio versions in 2002, but like the books' temptresses, they have had long legs. Sales remained so brisk that in 2006 ''Between the Sheets'' was the bestselling download-only title on Audible. So in August, four years after they were first recorded, Random House Audio released both titles on CD. With 7 of the top 10 download-only sellers on Audible in the erotica genre, the company has been a trailblazer in the category, albeit a conflicted one.\n''We can tell our children that we helped to spawn the audio erotica industry,'' Beth Anderson, the publisher of Audible, said with a laugh. ''We started it not necessarily because we wanted to be in the erotica business, but because it seemed like a niche that wasn't being filled.''\nWhen Audible started nine years ago, ''porn'' and ''sex'' were popular Web search terms, even more so than now. So as an Internet company, Audible chose to offer racy titles. It now has hundreds of briskly selling erotica offerings, most available only as downloads, and increasingly geared toward women, including the ''Herotica'' series edited by the sex guru Susie Bright.\nSuch titles can be procured online discreetly and can be listened to discreetly as well. ''One of the things that makes erotica sell better for us than other places is that when you're on the subway listening to your iPod, no one knows whether you're listening to The Wall Street Journal or a Penthouse book,'' Ms. Anderson said. (This is perhaps alarming, given that a recent survey in AudioFile magazine found that 53 percent of listeners played audiobooks while driving their cars.)\nMs. McIntosh, the Random House Audio publisher, said that while the company was beginning to roll Penthouse titles onto CDs, based on their download success, ''we don't expect much in terms of bricks-and-mortar sales.''\nRather, she expects them to sell well on Amazon and through adult catalogs, where they can be bought by listeners who, as she put it, ''might be embarrassed to bring them up to the register.'' An added advantage: with a book on an iPod, there is nothing to hide under the mattress.
1816244	ROOM TO IMPROVE	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Q. My kitchen cabinets are scarred and scuffed. Should I repair or replace them?\nA. It's no small decision, given that kitchens are the most expensive rooms to renovate, and cabinetry is almost always the costliest item in the room.\nNot surprisingly, a cabinet's longevity depends on its composition. Those made of plywood or high-quality particleboard covered in wood veneer typically last 30 to 40 years, according to Steve Kaufer, president of Maple Craft USA, a cabinet supplier based in Albion, Pa. (800-756-8077 or maplecraftusa.com).\nSolid wood cabinets tend to last longer and age more gracefully. ''They actually look better with a few nicks,'' said Christopher March, a partner in Lalire March Architects, a Manhattan-based firm with a long history of apartment renovations.\nWhatever the material, painted cabinets generally age poorly. It doesn't take long for scratches and peeling to reveal the wood or primer beneath. And if the cabinets have recessed panels, water and dirt can collect on the ledges around the panels, causing paint to disintegrate.\nBill Vandeventer, a partner in Vandeventer + Carlander Architects, based in Seattle, said he discourages clients with children from choosing painted wood cabinets. ''They don't do well if they aren't pampered by their owner,'' he said. ''They can get beat up pretty fast.''\nOf course, you don't have to wait for your cabinets to reach that point before you replace them. ''People often simply get tired of their cabinets, though they might blame it on nicks or stains,'' Mr. March said. ''The same way you might find a way to justify buying a new coat every winter, you might justify buying new cabinets every 5 or 10 years.''\nInstead of spending, say, $30,000 to replace your cabinets, you could consider having them refaced. This process involves replacing the cabinet doors and drawer fronts, and covering cabinet frames with matching veneer. It also allows for smaller improvements, like new hardware and rollout shelves.\nRefacing costs about half as much as replacing the cabinets, according to Marshall Jacobowitz, sales manager for Nu-Facers Kitchens by Carra Designs, a Manhattan-based company that specializes in the technique (212-426-4160 or nufacers.com).\nAnother advantage: refacing takes no more than three or four days, and you don't lose the use of your kitchen during that period, as you do with a conventional renovation.\nOn the other hand, refacing makes sense only if the cabinets are structurally sound, and if the proportions and position of your cabinets suit the space. Are all the plates and pans inside within easy reach? Do the cabinets stand in efficient relationship to the refrigerator, stove and sink? If not, then you may want to start over.\n''Replacing cabinets is the most expensive way to go,'' said Mr. Vandeventer, who designed the new kitchen above, ''but it gives you the opportunity to move appliances, reconfigure cabinets and add features that weren't there before.''\nIf you're disposing of your old cabinets, you might consider giving them to Build It Green! NYC, a nonprofit group based in Astoria, Queens. The group will pick the cabinets up and resell them, along with other used building goods, to reduce waste and help fund the group's local environmental programs. Donations are tax-deductible. (Information: 718-777-0132 or bignyc.org.)\nReplace or reface -- either way the investment will at least pay for itself. According to a study released last month by the National Association of Realtors, a $20,400 kitchen renovation in the New York area increases a home's value by $20,885, or 102.4 percent of the cost.

1816246	GARDEN Q. & A.	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EEDA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Q. We have heard that Australian laurel is a great houseplant: pretty, fragrant and easy to grow. But our local nursery doesn't have it and it isn't in our houseplant book. Can you help?\nA. Try looking for Pittosporum tobira, a multistemmed evergreen shrub that is widely planted outdoors in warm climates.\nIts other name is Japanese mock orange, but it would be better to call it sweet Toby and thus describe both its perfume and its disposition. Indoors and out, this Oriental ( not Australian) import is drought tolerant, not fussy about soil and willing to bloom almost everywhere except in deep shade.\nP. tobira's whorls of leathery leaves stay attractive year-round. Bloom lasts for about a month in spring, when clusters of small cream-colored flowers send out the scent of orange blossoms.\nThe plant can have a lanky growth habit and is often improved by pruning. But flowers form mostly on the branch ends, so be sure to prune right after bloom and leave some older growth for insurance.\nAnd consider a variety that makes up for fewer flowers with splashier foliage. Choices include the green and white Variegata, from Woodlanders (803-648-7522 or woodlanders.net); gold-tinged Kansai Sunburst, from Asiatica Nursery (asiaticanursery.com); and the silvery Platinum, from Cistus Nursery (503-621-2233 or cistus.com).\nGive your indoor P. tobira bright filtered light; an east or west window is fine. Feed once a month between February and September, using flowering-plant fertilizer diluted to half strength. And let the soil dry down an inch or so between waterings. Wet roots are the only stress it cannot overcome.\nQ. Do you have any suggestions on how to get my crown of thorns to flower in an apartment with poor natural light?\nA. Although you do not say so, I have the feeling you would rather avoid using grow lights. But when indoor plants need light, the only solution to ''poor natural'' is ''good artificial.'' If a thorough window cleaning does not improve the situation, your best bet might be fancy-leaf begonias. They grow well in dim apartments and although their flowers are seldom showy, they can bloom in what a crown of thorns would call the pitch dark.
1816247	A 180degrees View of a Hotbed Of Housing Design	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506EEDA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	AS any architect knows, wedding vows are negotiable in the face of a design competition. Six months after Deborah Richmond and Olivier Touraine, architects in Los Angeles, married in 2001, they found themselves facing off on teams competing for the high-profile job of overhauling the grounds of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n''It was really difficult; it was really tense,'' said Mr. Touraine, who worked with a former boss, the flamboyant French architect Jean Nouvel, and shuttled for four months between France and California.\n''It was really fun,'' said Ms. Richmond, who moved to Rotterdam in the Netherlands to work on Rem Koolhaas's team. ''It was like Deb's Big European Adventure.''\nThey talked by phone, but never about work. ''The atmosphere was like 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' '' she said, recalling the film about assassins told to kill each other. ''That movie was so close to our experience that we preordered tickets.''\nThe couple met in 1997, when he was working for Mr. Nouvel and she for Jon Jerde, the California master of mall design. The firms were designing parts of a commercial complex in Japan, and Ms. Richmond acted as translator and guide for Mr. Touraine and Mr. Nouvel when they visited the Jerde office here.\nEight months later Mr. Touraine, who is French, moved to Los Angeles, ostensibly for a job at the Southern California Institute of Architecture. ''I really moved here because of Debbie,'' he said.\nThe couple also started a firm here, Touraine Richmond Architects, and after the museum-grounds competition they settled back into working together. (The museum chose the Koolhaas plan, but abandoned it for lack of funds). They did a series of Los Angeles projects, including a home they converted from a 12-car garage in the Hollywood Hills for Wim Wenders, the filmmaker, and his wife, Donata.\nTheir latest collaboration is the so-called One Window House, a home they share with their 2-month-old son, Thomas. Once a backwater of tattoo parlors and beachside bodybuilders, Venice has become a percolating design district with a growing inventory of adventurous homes on narrow lots. Much of Frank Gehry's early work was in Venice, and he is building a highly anticipated home for himself three blocks south of the One Window House.\n''This is a real laboratory,'' Ms. Richmond said, ''especially for young architects.''\nLike other architects living here, Mr. Touraine, 43, and Ms. Richmond, 39, gravitated to Venice for its freedom: they could design what they liked without obeisance to a prevailing style. ''Context?'' Ms. Richmond said. ''What context? There's a bungalow here and stucco condo there.''\nArchitects also move here for the bargains (or did until a few years ago, when Venice real estate started to catch up with the rest of Los Angeles). In 2002 the couple paid $337,000 for a 3,900-square-foot plot and a two-story stucco house from 1951, which now contains a rental apartment and a studio for their firm.\nThey designed a second house for themselves and built it next door in 2005 for $410,000, or about $275 a square foot -- as opposed to $300 to $350 for typical architect-designed houses in the area -- largely by drawing on unconventional materials. A translucent plastic welding screen is used in place of a closet door, for example, and their fireplace is mounted in a black box built out of an inflammable material made of pressed paper.\n''The materials create a certain lightness and thriftiness that richer materials would not impart,'' Ms. Richmond said.\nOn a recent morning they fed Thomas in the open living room as distinctive California light filtered through sage, alder and California myrtle visible through glass walls framing a 180-degree view. ''It's almost like our porch,'' Ms. Richmond said. ''We wave to our neighbors without leaving the couch.''\nIn fact, the couple consider the first-floor living area as much outdoors as indoors, a classic California sentiment. For all its light and views, the first floor does not have windows, only those walls of glass.\nThe openness gives way to utter privacy as you walk upstairs into a corrugated steel box with a compact labyrinth of rooms. In fact, the couple originally intended to build the No Window House, but in a last-minute concession to the ocean breeze they installed one horizontal strip in the master bedroom.

1816249	Plugging Into The Sun	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03EEDA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	WILLIAM LEININGER is not your typical environmental zealot. A Navy commander who works as a doctor at the Naval Medical Center San Diego, he is a Republican and lives in one of California's most conservative counties, in a development of neat lawns and Spanish-style houses. His 2,400-square-foot, single-level house -- ''the usual Southern California design,'' he said recently -- is barely distinguishable from its neighbors, apart from one detail: the red-tile roof is crammed with solar panels.\nDr. Leininger, 42, is one of thousands of Californians, many of them unlikely converts to the cause of alternative energy, who have installed solar power systems in their homes in just the last year.\nSpurred by recent legislation that provides financial incentives -- and by rising energy costs and, perhaps, by a lingering distrust of power companies in the aftermath of the California electricity crisis at the start of the decade -- homeowners across the state have come to see solar power as a way to conserve money as well as natural resources. Architects in California are routinely designing solar systems into custom homes, and developers are offering solar systems and solar-ready wiring in new spec houses and subdivisions.\nSolar power is also emerging as a kind of status symbol, a glamorous mark of personal responsibility. Celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Alicia Silverstone, Carlos Santana and Tom Seaver, have installed solar systems. (Edward Norton runs a campaign in Los Angeles, encouraging his fellow celebrities to install solar panels on their homes and to make donations for systems in low-income housing.)\nThe vogue began in earnest a year ago, when the state legislature approved the California Solar Initiative, one of the most ambitious solar programs in the world. The legislation took effect at the start of this month but was preceded by a stopgap measure with similar terms that ran throughout 2006, offering homeowners a rebate on top of the federal tax credit of up to $2,000 that has been available nationwide since 2006.\nThe theory was that supplanting the year-to-year incentive programs in place since 1998 with the long-term certainty offered by the initiative's 10-year, $3.2 billion program of rebates (one-third of which would likely go to homeowners) would stimulate the development of a robust solar sector -- which could then be weaned from subsidies as its growing scale brought down prices.\nIf it works as planned, said J. P. Ross, the policy director for Vote Solar, an organization that advocates for large state-level solar projects, the initiative will stimulate the installation of 3,000 megawatts of solar electrical generating capacity in the state over the next decade. That would be an increase by a factor of more than 20, Mr. Ross said, equivalent to 30 small natural-gas-fired power plants.\nGiven the enthusiasm homeowners have shown for the initiative, filing nearly twice as many plans for solar systems with the California State Energy Commission in 2006 than in previous years, this goal may not be far-fetched.\nOther states are considering the future of their solar programs (several states in the Northeast and the Southwest have less ambitious ones in place, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut), and they are closely watching California's.\nAs the rebate program has made it less expensive to install a home solar system -- and as banks, which consider a solar system to be an improvement that increases a house's value, have made financing readily available -- the solar industry has grown. There are now 434 companies registered to install solar systems by the state energy commission, which together installed just under 50 megawatts of solar electric generating capacity in 2006, the most in a single year. (California's total capacity by October was 180 megawatts, enough energy to power about 135,000 homes. At the end of 2005 the nationwide solar photovoltaic capacity was 425 megawatts.)\nWhile much of the total came from industrial and utility installations, more than 7,000 homeowners filed plans with the state energy commission in 2006, up from about 4,000 in each of the previous two years.\nThe companies are responding not only to an increase in demand, but also to a change in the type of consumers interested in going solar. Unlike the do-it-yourself tinkerers who once made up much of the home photovoltaic market, the people fueling the current growth spurt are interested in hands-off user friendliness.\n''I more or less set it up and then I forgot about it,'' said Nicky González Yuen, an instructor in political science at De Anza College in Cupertino, who hired a company called NextEnergy to install the modest three-kilowatt system in his 100-year-old Berkeley duplex. ''I'm a really busy person, and I didn't need to know that level of information.''\nCompanies like NextEnergy provide homeowners with a complete package that includes system design, permit applications, rebate processing, installation, maintenance and warranty. ''It was a seamless, painless process,'' said Mr. Yuen, whose system cost $16,000 after the California rebate and the federal tax credit, which together saved him $10,000. It was ''comparable to having a sprinkler system put in,'' he said.\nMr. Yuen, 47, was the first on his block to install a solar system: ''In my circle I'm the eco-nut,'' he said. But, he said, less than a year later they are quite common in his neighborhood. ''A lot of people are really paying attention and beginning to think about the whole environmental cycle,'' he added.\nBut even as these solar adopters re-evaluate their relationship to the power grid, virtually all of them remain connected to it, which is contrary to the go-it-alone image of the early solar pioneers. Though the connection means a house will lose power in a blackout, most home users find the ease of operation makes up for the loss of independence.\n''All I see is an e-mail from the system once a month,'' said Robert Felton, chief executive of TenFold, a software company, of the report of how much power his mansion in the Oakland hills is using and producing.\nAs recently as 10 years ago it was unheard of and, in fact, illegal for solar-powered houses in California to connect to the grid; now power companies are legally required to credit their customers for the excess power they produce.\nThe grid, in effect, serves to store power, replacing the bank of batteries that is a component of off-grid systems. At the end of the year, credits for solar power added to the grid are applied against charges for power taken from it, helping homeowners ''zero out'' their electricity bills. According to Borrego Solar Systems, the company that installed the long rows of solar panels on a hill next to Mr. Felton's house, two-thirds of its customers manage to do so.\nExcess credits are lost at the end of the year, so homeowners, at least for now, cannot make a profit from their solar systems. Even so, the savings can be substantial: in 2005 Mr. Felton paid Pacific Gas and Electric about $2,500 a month for electricity. (''I have a whole bunch of fountains and water features and stuff like that,'' he said.) In California residential electricity rates are tiered, and large users like Mr. Felton pay rates about three times higher than more modest consumers, making solar power even more attractive.\nWhile the average home solar system is about five kilowatts, Mr. Felton's is 45 kilowatts, and he seldom sees an electric bill. Borrego Solar estimated the system could save Mr. Felton almost $2 million over 30 years -- far more than the $255,000 the system cost him after a $134,000 rebate.\nMr. Felton, 67, said that a solar system did not make sense when he built his house in 2000, but that the rebate, as well as rising electricity prices, persuaded him to install the system last year. His pragmatic concerns were also informed by broader issues. ''I'm not a hippie greenie,'' he said, pointing out that with a background in nuclear engineering, he strongly supports nuclear power. ''But solar is certainly a way to get off foreign oil.''\nAs a member of the military who has been deployed to the Persian Gulf three times, Dr. Leininger has been affected by the nation's foreign oil habits more than most. ''The need for stable oil supplies is the big reason that we spend so much time in the Persian Gulf,'' he said. ''Decreasing our national energy consumption is in my self-interest.''\nHis neighbors in the San Diego suburb of Escondido, most of them politically conservative, have responded well to the solar panels of the eight-kilowatt system that he and his wife, Suzann, a cartographer, installed last year on their roof. The neighborhood association, which was required to approve the plan by California law, did so happily, he said. Lately, the Leiningers have noticed at least one other photovoltaic system in the immediate area and a number of solar heating systems for swimming pools. (Meanwhile, in Orange County, which is known for its political conservatism, about 250 solar installations were approved from January to November last year, more than twice the 2005 figure.)\nThe Leiningers, who paid Borrego Solar $39,000 for their system after a $24,000 rebate, figure their system will pay for itself in a dozen years -- assuming residential electricity rates do not increase, as they have by 37 percent since 1998. Dr. Leininger estimated that his system had reduced his household carbon emissions by nearly 30 tons since it was installed in June, and that it was well on its way to zeroing out.\n''It comes down to personal responsibility,'' he said. ''If I can go electricity-neutral on my house, that's that much less coal we have to burn.''\nAnd much less money. ''One of the most gratifying things is on a sunny day when the meter is spinning backward,'' Dr. Leininger said. ''We have a guaranteed return on the system because we know we're not going to have an electric bill from now on.''\nChasing Solar Power in the Northeast\nHOME solar systems in the Northeast can produce up to 90 percent of the electricity generated by those in California, said Michael Hall, chief marketing officer for Borrego Solar Systems, a company in California. It is not surprising, then, that some California installers are expanding nationally. They include PowerLight and Akeena Solar, which opened offices in New Jersey in the last two years.\nThe New York State Energy Research and Development Authority's Web site, powernaturally.org, explains the state's incentive program, which has been in place since 2002. It covers 40 percent to 70 percent of the cost of a home system, depending on its size and other factors. State-approved installers are listed at the site as well.\nNew Jersey has been offering rebates to homeowners for photovoltaic systems since 2001, and it is now the second-largest solar market in the country. The state offers rebates up to $3.80 per watt for home systems. While this is less than New York's rate, New Jersey makes it possible for system owners to sell renewable energy credits and earn continuing revenues, unlike New York and most other states. Details and contact information for dozens of installers are at the New Jersey Clean Energy Program's Web site, njcep.com.\nConnecticut's rebate program pays up to $25,000 per solar photovoltaic installation, depending on the components used and how they are configured.

1816250	Art Above and Below, With Life in the Middle	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02EEDA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	IT has been more than five years since the first of Ann Brashares's ''Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants'' novels, which would become a sensation among teenage girls, hit the best-seller list. The last book in the series, ''Forever in Blue: The Fourth Summer of the Sisterhood,'' will be published on Tuesday, but during that half decade, the characters have aged only about three years.\nTo anyone who knows Ms. Brashares and her husband, Jacob Collins, a portrait painter, that lag makes perfect sense. Mr. Collins, too, seems to slow time to suit his purposes: He paints in the classical tradition, using centuries-old techniques to create works that could have been produced hundreds of years ago.\nHis style is so out, it may be in again. As the ringleader of a group of youngish painters devoted to classical techniques, Mr. Collins was recently named one of the art world's most powerful people by Art & Auction magazine, and lately his paintings have been selling for as much as $125,000. Writing about him, the magazine noted that ''although many attempt to buck modernism's strong attraction, only the truly powerful -- and talented -- can pull it off.''\nMr. Collins, 42, runs a school of classical painting, called the Water Street Atelier, out of the house he and Ms. Brashares, 39, share with their three children, Susannah, 5, Nate, 8, and Sam, 11. Students -- about a dozen at a time -- spend four years studying with Mr. Collins, working long hours that begin when the first model begins posing at 8:30 each morning. The students sometimes share meals with the family, walk the dog and baby-sit for the children. And the children occasionally pose in the studio, usually while watching videos, a not-very-classical technique to help them sit still.\nFor years the couple tried to accommodate both their growing family and Mr. Collins's studio and art school in a Brooklyn brownstone, while Ms. Brashares worked as an editor at 17th Street Productions, a packager of teen novels. At one point, with the ménage bursting at the seams, Mr. Collins rented a studio in Dumbo. But in 2000, the couple began looking for a building big enough to accommodate both home and studio, with separate entrances. ''We were pretty flexible about geography, because the requirements for the building were so specific,'' Ms. Brashares said.\nA broker directed them to a four-story building in the East 60s that had been built as a carriage house but for years had housed the Sculpture Center, a school and gallery. Essentially an industrial space -- the sculptors had been using it for welding and stone-carving -- it had no living quarters at all, which is why it was a bargain, the couple said (although they declined to say how much they paid for it). They had profited from the sale of their Brooklyn house and had enjoyed ''a small windfall'' when 17th Street, of which Ms. Brashares was a part-owner, was sold. Still, they said, they borrowed to the hilt to buy the building.\nThey hired Fairfax & Sammons, a Manhattan firm known for classical architecture, to renovate the 25-foot-wide, 100-foot-deep building. Richard Sammons, a partner in the firm, began by leaving the ground floor studio pretty much as he found it, with 15-foot ceilings and a black terrazzo floor. (It is so big that the couple can park their car inside without disturbing the students.) On the upper levels, about 4,000 square feet in all, Mr. Sammons created new interiors that look as if they had been there forever, thanks to features like leaded-glass windows.\nThe architectural details are far less lavish than in many Fairfax & Sammons houses, like a grandiose 60,000-square-foot mansion that the firm is currently completing in Palm Beach. At around $500 a square foot for construction, Mr. Collins said, ''our budget was too low'' for ostentation. The house's beauty lies in its proportions. The kitchen is nearly a perfect square, as is the library, with the result that you feel properly situated the moment you walk into either room.\nThe layout, though, is far from traditional. First, the couple asked Mr. Sammons to dispense with a dining room. Ms. Brashares, who grew up with three brothers and no sisters in a series of houses around Washington, D.C., said, ''We always had a big dining room that nobody went into.'' Instead, Mr. Sammons turned the back of the house into a 25-by-25-foot kitchen, with multiple work areas for adults and children. In the library at the front of the house, several shelves are filled with candy-colored foreign editions of the ''Traveling Pants'' books, in more than 30 languages. A stair in the large central hall leads to an upper level with four bedrooms. From there, another stairway ascends to Ms. Brashares's office, alone on the top floor, her haven.\n''I'm careful not to bring household stuff up there,'' she said. ''I arrange the play dates in the kitchen; I pay the bills in the kitchen.'' She writes, mostly at night, on a tiny laptop, surrounded by several of Mr. Collins' paintings -- just a few of the more than 100 of his older works that cover the walls of the house.\nMs. Brashares and Mr. Collins met when she was just 18. At the time, he was a junior at Columbia, and she was a freshman at Barnard; his father, Arthur Collins, was one of her philosophy professors. During their first encounter, in the library, he sketched her portrait.\nIn the early years of their marriage, Ms. Brashares worked as an editorial assistant, and then an editor, while Mr. Collins, who had attended the New York Academy of Art, honed his technique. In 1999, after hearing a colleague describe how she had once shared a pair of pants with friends, Ms. Brashares began working on a book about four teenage girlfriends who spend their summers apart, but stay in touch in part by taking turns wearing the same magical jeans, which somehow fit each of their bodies.\nPublished in September 2001, ''Traveling Pants'' was an immediate success. There are now 7 million copies of the books in print in North America alone, according to Noreen Marchisi, a spokeswoman for Random House, Ms. Brashares's publisher. (This despite the fact that Ms. Brashares tells parents not to buy the books for children under 12, who she thinks may not be ready for the mild sexual content.)\nShe has just completed her first novel for adults, about a group of friends in their early 20s, called ''The Last Summer (of You & Me).'' It will be published in June. She decided to end the ''Traveling Pants'' series with the latest book, ensuring through a plot twist that the series cannot be revived (though ''it's not like I kill off any of the characters,'' she said).\nAlthough she could easily have extended the series, and the considerable income it generated, Ms. Brashares said that she was ''ready to move on.'' In any case, she added, all that money came too late to contribute to the high cost of the house and its renovation, beyond a few antiques and a ''somewhat old rug'' for the center hall.\n''I remember thinking: I wish I'd known the book would succeed, because I would have tiled our bathroom,'' she said.\nAT HOME WITH ANN BRASHARES AND JACOB COLLINS
1816251	Travails of Adolescence? He's Been There	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEEDA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	What makes ninth grade funny? Having your mom beat you in basketball? Figuring out why girls like bad boys? Learning to be a team player only after not making the basketball team? James Lewis, popularly known as Lil' J J, a 16-year-old stand-up comedian from Little Rock, Ark., is plying those examples of teenage angst as the character Jordan Lewis, on ''Just Jordan,'' a new Nickelodeon series about Jordan, his friends and family in Los Angeles that begins Sunday.\nThe series is big news for fans of Lil' J J, whose real-life story is a sort of a fairy tale. Mr. Lewis, a slight, unassuming guy with corn-rowed hair and earrings, won national fame after beating comedians twice his age in a 2003 BET comedy competition.\nThe oldest of four children of a single mother who works as a cosmetologist, Mr. Lewis' Cinderella victory landed him on NBC's ''Tonight Show'' and the series ''Showtime at the Apollo,'' and a place last year in BET's Teens of Comedy, a 20-city tour with other young comedians.\nMr. Lewis could also be seen in 2005 and early last year as a host of Nickelodeon's ''Friday Night Slimetime'' and on the channel's sketch comedy series ''All That.'' Mr. Lewis's charisma has translated to film as well. He made his feature film debut in 2005 in ''Beauty Shop,'' and also appeared in ''Yours, Mine and Ours'' and ''Crossover'' last year.\n''I don't know why I am funny,'' he said during a recent visit to New York to promote his new series. ''I just like making people happy, and I like making people laugh.'' Based in Los Angeles, Mr. Lewis said that visiting Little Rock twice a month ''keeps me grounded.'' He has neither a car nor a girlfriend, he said, and has kept his old friends from Little Rock.\nIn ''Just Jordan'' Mr. Lewis plays a transplant from Little Rock to Los Angeles with a divorced mother (Shania Accius as Pam Lewis), a younger sister, Monica (Kristen Combs), and his maternal grandfather, Grant Lewis (Beau Billingslea). Grandpa owns a diner where the whole family pitches in.\nJordan's two constant companions are Tony Lee (Justin Chon), a good-looking basketball player, and the tie-wearing, somewhat nerdy Joaquin Montez (Eddy Martin). Periodically the show uses a device of freezing the action and having Jordan literally step out of his body to comment on the situation.\n''It's a way for a kid to talk back, to say all the things about your mom and life that you can't say to their face,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''Or you're trying to talk to a girl, and it's not happening, and you can ask, 'Why is it that girls say they like nice guys but they always go for the thugs?' ''\nA few years ago Mr. Lewis was just another class clown at Mitchell Elementary School in Little Rock (which his hometown newspaper, The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette noted, is exactly 1,675 miles from Hollywood). But his gym teacher Ken Bright -- who now helps manage Mr. Lewis's career -- thought the young boy had a real shot at professional comedy. In exchange for Mr. Lewis's quieting down in class, Mr. Bright helped him polish his act and get his start at a place called Juanita's Bar and Grill.\n''Sometimes I would tell places about him, and then he would show up, and they would be shocked by his age,'' Mr. Bright recalled with a laugh, as he as Mr. Lewis were interviewed in the Nickelodeon office in Times Square. ''Then they'd ask, 'But is he clean?' ''\nHis comedy is. And he said he received a standing ovation after his first performance at Juanita's. ''I was shocked,'' he said. ''That feeling, I was anxious to keep doing it. And my mom was happy I was doing something. She was happy that someone was seeing the talent in me.''\n''She was like, 'I don't want my son doing dirty comedy,' '' Mr. Lewis said. ''I always look at it like family stuff, so I'm going to keep it clean. I wouldn't do anything that my little brothers and sister couldn't see because they look up to me.''\nMost of the people in his audiences on the stand-up circuit have been adults, Mr. Lewis said, but they were all teenagers once too, so they relate to a universe of jokes about curfews, parents, school. ''A lot of the things I went through, they went through,'' Mr. Lewis said of his adult audiences. ''Comedy is comedy.''\n''The main advice I get is, 'Don't get the big head,' '' he continued. ''I hear that. I feel blessed. It's not often that someone in my shoes gets to do what I have done.''\nThe series creator, Alison Taylor, (''The Cheetah Girls,'' ''Lizzie McGuire'') said ''Just Jordan'' is not preachy but finds the lessons in everyday experiences, the contradictions between what life should be but often is not. Future episodes, for example, show Jordan meeting a series of challenges: fighting to spend his allowance the way he wants, being left in charge of the diner, trying to pass his piano test to stay on the basketball team.\n''J J and the show dovetail so nicely,'' Ms. Taylor said. ''J J is the most average kid you've ever met, to the extent that he's a stand-up comedian who travels the country. We're not doing some high-concept, over-the-top idea where he runs a toy company. The premise of the show is the idea that when you're an adolescent, you think, 'I know how life works if my parents would just stay out of the way.' ''
1816252	Agitprop Tactics, Spoofs and Semantics in the Bronx	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CEEDA1730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	A favorite sport in today's bloated art world is to lament the surfeit of commercial galleries, biennials and art fairs, which have replaced the ''genuine'' art experience provided by nonprofit organizations. But as Matthew Higgs, director of White Columns, the city's oldest alternative art space, recently pointed out in Artforum, the nonprofit scene in New York is thriving.\nMr. Higgs's examples -- Artists Space, the Kitchen, Printed Matter -- fall mostly within Chelsea and Lower Manhattan. To his list you might add the Longwood Arts Project in the Bronx. Founded in 1981 by the Bronx Council on the Arts, the project has welcomed residents including Ernesto Pujol, Pepón Osorio and Tim Rollins & Kids of Survival (K.O.S.). Longwood also maintains, perhaps more than any other alternative art space in the city, a tangible relationship with its surroundings.\n''South Bronx Contemporary: Longwood Arts Project's 25th Anniversary'' at the project's gallery space consists of three installations put together by former Longwood directors: Fred Wilson, Betti-Sue Hertz and Eddie Torres.\nLongwood's position as an art world entity and part of the South Bronx cultural landscape is immediately apparent in Ms. Hertz's installation, ''Street Disturbance.'' Excerpts from William Pope.L's ''Black Factory'' project include a vitrine of objects like a James Brown doll and a melted hair pick labeled as if it were crime-scene evidence and a video in which Mr. Pope.L enlisted masked participants to approach people at a fair in Maine and ask them about race.\nIncluded in this section are the Surveillance Camera Players, who use similar agitprop tactics in their videos, posing masked in front of surveillance cameras holding signs reading ''1984'' or ''Big Brother.'' Etcétera, an Argentine collective, videotapes its performances, which look like soccer rallies but involve pointing out the homes of suspected torturers during the ''Dirty War,'' the deadly civil conflict that took place in Argentina from 1976 to 1983.\n''Iconoclasm,'' organized by Mr. Torres, takes a lighter approach, simply celebrating the Bronx's cultural diversity. Dylan Mortimer's ''Prayer Booth,'' a copy of an aluminum phone booth outfitted with a pull-down knee rest, and his ''Portable Kneeler'' with red and yellow construction-site graphics, are similarly playful -- paying homage to, and spoofing, the religious art of this heavily Hispanic and Roman Catholic borough.\nA wall hung salon-style with paintings, drawings and photographs continues Mr. Torres's Bronx-centric view of art and culture. Some of the lopsided portraits found here look frankly amateurish, like the paintings found in thrift stores. But there are also Olga Kitt's canny rendering of ''Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' as a Graffiti'' and her Picasso redux, ''Demoiselles Da Bronx.'' A video of the drag queen Princess Xtravaganza performing and Sally DeJesus' remake of the board game Monopoly with South Bronx streets add to this roundup of local-inflected art.\nThe tightest installation in the show, ''Black Now,'' is the work of Longwood's first director, Mr. Wilson. An artist known for his critiques of institutions and of accepted versions of history, he treats ''Black Now'' as a curatorial outing and an unannounced exhibition of items from his own collection. Interspersed among works by Kara Walker, Kalup Linzy and Rashawn Griffin are vitrines filled with objects -- everything from black ceramic panthers and dark-skinned Nativity figures to black light bulbs, Black perfume by Kenneth Cole and black pasta (squid-ink pasta).\nWalls are lined with T-shirts for bands like Black Flag and Black Maria, and a grid of wall-mounted DVD boxes features titles like ''Black Hawk Down,'' ''Black Orpheus,'' ''Black Beauty'' and ''Men in Black.''\nMr. Wilson's own contribution pretty much steals the show in this installation, although Carl Pope's letterpress posters, filled with proclamations like ''Black makes me feel thin'' and ''Black is Beauty, Pride, Power. Black is Me!,'' reveal a similar semantic intelligence.\nLongwood's mission, to nurture unknown talent, especially ''underrepresented groups such as people of color and women,'' can feel at times like revisiting the early '90s, when identity politics were as much a genre of contemporary art as portraiture or landscape painting were in the 19th century. Today, when the trend is toward emerging artists from around the globe, Longwood feels even more anchored in its neighborhood.\n''South Bronx Contemporary: Longwood Arts Project's 25th Anniversary'' continues through March 10 at Longwood Art Gallery, Hostos Community College, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx; (718) 518-6728 or longwoodcyber.org.\nART REVIEW\nCorrection: January 9, 2007, Tuesday An art review on Thursday about the exhibition ''South Bronx Contemporary: Longwood Arts Project's 25th Anniversary,'' at Hostos Community College in the Bronx, omitted a curator. The wall of art hung salon-style was organized by Edwin Ramoran under the title ''Everyday Is Like Sunday''; it is not part of ''Iconoclasm,'' organized by Eddie Torres and hanging in the same room.\nA picture caption with the review misstated the given name of a former director of the Longwood Arts Project who is also one of the curators of the show. As noted in the review, he is Fred Wilson, not Frank.
1816253	And Now for Something Classically Odd	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E7D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Going to a P. D. Q. Bach concert is like listening to a Beethoven symphony: You know what's coming but still like it when it gets there. The tradition (or is it habit?) survives after more than 40 years; so do its ritual formats. Both were greeted at Avery Fisher Hall on Tuesday by a large and unusually smart-mouthed audience. Members of the New York Philharmonic played along mostly with good grace, though some looked to be salvaging what they could of their dignity.\nPeter Schickele as conductor, lecturer, comedian (physical and stand-up) and behind-the-scenes composer did his customary show and tell on the fictional Bach progeny of the show's title. William Walters roamed the stage in his vile sports jacket, insulting latecomers, doing minor carpentry and creating electrical crises. Smiling but a little dazed by it all, Xian Zhang shared the conducting.\nThe usual odd instruments were wheeled in: a bicycle that whistled as Lloyd Peterson pumped its pedals, a table full of toys managed by Michèle Eaton among others, bagpipes in various states of undress played by Maurice Eisenstadt, and popped balloons as low-rent replacements for the big guns of Tchaikovsky's ''1812'' Overture.\nMr. Schickele's dreadful puns (Brittany Spears as French weaponry) would not long survive outside the pomposities and gloomy rituals of the symphonic stage. Anyone who wonders at operagoers tittering over Wagner's lamest attempts at humor, might look also at a P. D. Q. Bach event to understand that breaching classical music's earnest defense of protocol becomes both exciting and guilt-inducing. Mr. Schickele and his crew attack most formalities of stage behavior: entrances and exits, conductor greets concertmaster and the like. Lighting cues are rearranged to create maximum chaos. And along with Mr. Schickele's skill at manipulating hesitation is his considerable charm. Still vigorous, he looks more than ever like Santa Claus in need of a post-Christmas rest.\nThe foundations for Mr. Schickele's success have been pointed out many times. He is a master musician with a thorough grasp of composition. ''Fanfare for Fred'' points out vacuities of Baroque music that we too often treat with reflexive reverence. The ''Pervertimento for Bagpipes, Bicycle and Balloons'' begins with a firm understanding of Mozartean style. The Prelude to ''Einstein on the Fritz'' fails to take Philip Glass's repetitions too seriously. In the ''1712'' Overture Mr. Schickele nails Tchaikovsky and Beethoven with remarkable acuity.\nOn Tuesday there were old gags and new ones. Listeners seemed to like both. A year of white-tie-and-tails and churchlike bowings and scrapings awaits us in 2007, so maybe by 2008 the used-up air of P. D. Q. Bach will once again come at us feeling like a fresh breeze.\nMUSIC REVIEW
1816254	In China's New Revolution, Art Greets Capitalism	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E7D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	After the peppered beef carpaccio and before the pan-fried sea bass there were raucous toasts and the clinking of wine glasses in the V.I.P. room of New Heights, a jazzy restaurant in this city's most luxurious location, overlooking the Bund.\nWang Guangyi, one of China's pioneering contemporary artists, was there. So were Zhang Xiaogang, Fang Lijun, Yue Minjun, Zeng Fanzhi and 20 other well-known Chinese artists and their guests, many of whom had been flown in from Beijing to celebrate the opening of a solo exhibition of new works by Zeng Hao, another rising star in China's bubbly art scene.\n''We've had opening dinners before,'' said the Shanghai artist Zhou Tiehai, sipping Chilean red wine, ''but nothing quite like this until very recently.''\nThe dinner, held on a recent Saturday night in a restaurant located on the top floor of a historic building that also houses an Armani store and the Shanghai Gallery of Art, was symbolic of the soaring fortunes of Chinese contemporary art.\nIn 2006 Sotheby's and Christie's, the world's biggest auction houses, sold $190 million worth of Asian contemporary art, most of it Chinese, in a series of record-breaking auctions in New York, London and Hong Kong. In 2004 the two houses combined sold $22 million in Asian contemporary art.\nThe climax came at a Beijing auction in November when a painting by Liu Xiaodong, 43, sold to a Chinese entrepreneur for $2.7 million, the highest price ever paid for a piece by a Chinese artist who began working after 1979, when loosened economic restrictions spurred a resurgence in contemporary art.\nThat price put Mr. Liu in the company of the few living artists, including Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons, whose work has sold for $2 million or more at auction.\n''This has come out of nowhere,'' said Henry Howard-Sneyd, global head of Asian arts at Sotheby's, which, like Christie's, has just started a division focusing on contemporary Chinese art.\nWith auction prices soaring, hundreds of new studios, galleries and private art museums are opening in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Chinese auction houses that once specialized in traditional ink paintings are now putting contemporary experimental artworks on the block.\nWestern galleries, especially in Europe, are rushing to sign up unknown painters; artists a year out of college are selling photographic works for as much as $10,000 each; well-known painters have yearlong waiting lists; and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Pompidou Center in Paris are considering opening branches in China.\n''What is happening in China is what happened in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century,'' said Michael Goedhuis, a collector and art dealer specializing in Asian contemporary art who has galleries in London and New York. ''New ground is being broken. There's a revolution under way.''\nBut the auction frenzy has also sparked debate here about whether sales are artificially inflating prices and encouraging speculators, rather than real collectors, to enter the art market.\nAuction houses ''sell art like people sell cabbage,'' said Weng Ling, the director of the Shanghai Gallery of Art. ''They are not educating the public or helping artists develop. Many of them know nothing about art.''\nBut the boom in Chinese contemporary art -- reinforced by record sales in New York last year -- has also brought greater recognition to a group of experimental artists who grew up during China's brutal Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).\nAfter the 1989 government crackdown in Tiananmen Square, avant-garde art was often banned from being shown here because it was deemed hostile or anti-authoritarian. Through the 1990s many artists struggled to earn a living, considering themselves lucky to sell a painting for $500.\nThat has all changed. These days China's leading avant-garde artists have morphed into multi-millionaires who show up at exhibitions wearing Gucci and Ferragamo.\nWang Guangyi, best-known for his Great Criticism series of Cultural Revolution-style paintings emblazoned with the names of popular Western brands, like Coke, Swatch and Gucci, drives a Jaguar and owns a 10,000-square-foot luxury villa on the outskirts of Beijing.\nYue Minjun, who makes legions of colorful smiling figures, has a walled-off suburban Beijing compound with an 8,000-square-foot home and studio. Fang Lijun, a ''Cynical Realist'' painter whose work captures artists' post-Tiananmen disillusionment, owns six restaurants in Beijing and operates a small hotel in western Yunnan province.\nIf China's art scene can be likened to a booming stock market, Zhang Xiaogang, 48, is its Google. More than any other Chinese artist Mr. Zhang, with his huge paintings depicting family photographs taken during the Cultural Revolution, has captured the imagination of international collectors. Prices for his work have skyrocketed at auction over the last two years.\nWhen his work ''Bloodline Series: Comrade No. 120'' sold for $979,000 at Sotheby's auction in March, many art insiders predicted the market had topped out and prices would plummet within months.\nBut in October, the British collector Charles Saatchi bought another of Mr. Zhang's pieces at Christie's in London for $1.5 million. Then in November at Christie's Hong Kong auction, Mr. Zhang's 1993 ''Tiananmen Square'' sold to a private collector for $2.3 million. According to Artnet.com, which tracks auction prices, 16 of Mr. Zhang's works have sold for $500,000 or more during the past two years.\nAre such prices justified? Uli Sigg, the former Swiss ambassador to China and perhaps the largest collector of Chinese contemporary art with more than 1,500 pieces, calls the market frothy but not finished.\n''I don't see anything at the moment that will stop the rise in prices,'' he said. ''More and more people are flocking to the market.''\nMr. Goedhuis insists that this is the beginning of an even bigger boom in Chinese contemporary art.\n''I don't think there's a bubble,'' he said. ''There's a lot of speculation but no bubble. That's the paradox. In China there are only a handful of buyers -- 10, 20, 30 -- out of a billion people. You only need another 10 to come in and that will jack up prices.''\nHe added: ''Another astonishing fact is there is not a single museum in the West that has committed itself to buying Chinese art. It's just starting to happen. Guggenheim, the Tate Modern, MoMA, they're all looking.''\nRepresentatives from those museums, as well as others, have made scouting missions to China. A growing number of international collectors are looking at Chinese art too.\n''After the 2005 Sotheby's show I just jumped in,'' said Didier Hirsch, a French-born California business executive who has long collected American and European contemporary art. ''People said the next big run-up in prices would be at Sotheby's in March so I said, 'Now or never.' '' Mr. Hirsch purchased nearly his entire collection -- about 40 works -- by phone after doing research on the Internet. He said he went first for what he called the titans -- the original group of post-'79 painters -- including Wang Guangyi and Liu Xiaodong.\nSome critics here say the focus on prices has led to a decline in creativity as artists knock off variations of their best-known work rather than exploring new territory. Some are even employing teams of workers in assembly-line fashion.\nChristopher Phillips, a curator at the International Center of Photography in New York, has become a regular visitor to China, scouting young artists for the center and other places. On a recent trip ''I went to visit the studio of a well-known Beijing painter,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''The artist wasn't there, but I saw a group of canvases being painted by a team of young women who seemed to be just in from the countryside. I found it a little disconcerting.''\nThere are also complaints that some artists are ignoring international standards by selling works directly into the auction market, rather than selling first to collectors. And many experts here say that some gallery officials and artists are sending representatives to the auctions to bid on their own works to prop up prices, or ''protect'' the prices of some rising stars.\nBut Lorenz Helbling, director of the ShanghART Gallery here, said Chinese artists continue to produce an impressive array of works, and that talk about the market being overrun by commercialism is exaggerated.\n''Things are much better than they were 10 years ago,'' he said. ''Back then many artists were commissioned to simply paint dozens of paintings for a gallery owner, who went out and sold those works. Now these artists are thinking more deeply about their work because they're finally getting the recognition they deserve.''
1816255	Deconstructing Meaning By Truly Mincing Words	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E7D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	There is more than one way to take the measure of books. You can of course read them. You can count pages, lines or words. Or you can dissect their texts, parsing and weighing words until they lose meaning while gaining literal substance, and then arrange the physical remnants of this concrete poetry into an epic of their own.\nThis is the method employed by Simryn Gill, who was born in Singapore and lives in Sydney, Australia, for her New York debut at the Tracy Williams gallery in the West Village. Ms. Gill, 47, has worked as a photographer, and this exhibition includes large black-and-white photographs of Run island, part of Indonesia; its small, dilapidated port was once central in the European nutmeg trade. The British ceded the island to the Dutch in 1667, as part of a treaty that gave the British a place called New Amsterdam, now known as Manhattan.\nMs. Gill is also an installation artist adept at reconfiguring found objects, books included. This is clear in the show's centerpiece: a fascinating untitled work ensconced through Saturday in the front parlor of the Federal-era house occupied by Ms. Williams's gallery. The room is a small, spare study that quickly turns strange: a bubbling brew of broken thoughts, natural history, literature, knowledge and the courses of empires.\nThe piece, which had its debut last spring at Tate Modern in London, has aspects of standard-issue late Conceptual Art, yet it is absorbing and often moving. To make it, Ms. Gill selected 123 books and targeted about 80 words. With the help of assistants, she combed through the books page by page, methodically tearing out by hand all instances of these words.\nThe torn-out words were sorted and bagged, then divided among 30 small gray archival boxes, two to four bags to a box. The boxed, bagged words and the 123 raggedy books constitute the piece, exhibited with three tables and six stools.\nYou can sit at the two tables where the books are lined up, to study their spines and browse their ravaged pages. At the third, you can open the boxes and handle the bags. Either way, language takes on new dimensions, by turns obdurate and frail.\nThe books, published over the last 80 or so years, are arranged in a specific order, starting with ''Handy Pocket Guide to Asian Gemstones'' by Carol Clark and ending with a 1969 edition of ''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men'' by James Agee and Walker Evans. The fluctuation of titles and subjects forms a kind of literal graph or haphazard timeline.\nMiles Hadfield's ''History of British Gardening'' is followed by Karl A. Wittfogel's ''Oriental Despotism,'' Buwei Yang Chao's ''How to Cook and Eat in Chinese'' and Sara Suleri's ''Meatless Days.'' Stephen Jay Gould's ''Wonderful Life'' stands beside ''Poisonous Snakes of the World,'' a manual for American amphibious forces published by the Navy in the 1960s as the American involvement in Vietnam was ramping up. The mental flights triggered by the titles are countered by the shared uselessness left between the covers. Hovering between literature and sculpture, these volumes are bereft, censored, fatally wounded.\nAt the third table the lost words are collated in a census of the censored. They resemble little flakes of bone, artifacts or specimens. One box holds two bags stuffed fat with the word ''still'' along with a thin, nearly empty one with a few forlorn scraps bearing the word ''sill.'' What a difference a letter makes.\nSome boxes have plump bags of a single word: two each of ''found'' and ''water''; three each of ''first,'' ''now'' and ''because.'' In other bags alliteration plays tag with meaning: ''matter,'' ''heart,'' ''manner,'' ''roam.''\nAlways the different weights document a dwindling from frequently to rarely used. ''Enough,'' ''slow,'' ''veranda.'' ''Perhaps,'' ''rice,'' ''gingerly,'' ''lull.'' The words become weirdly humanized in this context, prompting thoughts about power, majorities and minorities, isolation and segregation and their crippling effects. Thus regimented, language is rendered useless. It becomes victim to tyranny.\nSimryn Gill's work is on view through Saturday at Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212) 229-2757.\nLAST CHANCE: ART REVIEW
1816256	Dismantling the Beat to Get to the Heart of It	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E7D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	All good musicians have a physical relationship to their instruments, but a few make it really apparent. They tend to be big people with big instruments. Charles Mingus was this way, as are the Brazilian percussionist Carlinhos Brown and the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon. And so is the drummer Tyshawn Sorey, who isn't yet so well known outside inner-circle jazz audiences, who may have heard him play in bands with Dave Douglas or Vijay Iyer or Steve Coleman.\nDuring his set at Bowery Poetry Club on Tuesday night with his one of his own bands, Oblique, Mr. Sorey picked up two drumsticks and threw them hard against the side wall of the club, without grimacing or changing his expression. This happened not at an ending or a climax, but somewhere in the middle of everything.\nHe did many other things too. He did something like a photographic negative of drumming, by putting his fingertips on the drum, weighing down on them and then rhythmically pulling his fingers off. He picked up his snare drum, overturned it and blew and sucked at the metal snares. Then he placed the snare drum on top of his floor tom and maneuvered the top half in circles, scraping metal on metal, maneuvering and listening. Eventually he undid the high-hat cymbal, manhandling and playing its parts and hardware.\nFrom a distance this isn't so unusual. Drummers like Andrew Cyrille and Milford Graves and Han Bennink have been doing these kinds of things for 30 years or more. Some of them have become devices, or techniques. And a technique is an outside thing; you can buy it off the rack.\nBut there was something proprietary about the way Mr. Sorey was going about his business -- enveloping his equipment, almost inhaling that snare drum when he put it to his mouth -- that made it all seem like an inner imperative. One wants to say that if Mr. Sorey weren't otherwise such a technically competent and powerfully rhythmic drummer, fluent in broken funk rhythms and swing feeling, these little episodes of wild stagecraft wouldn't have been of much interest. But that isn't true because with him it's all connected, organized into one big style.\nThe show was a double bill. Oblique, a project with revolving personnel, played free-improvisation pieces, with Terry McManus on guitar, banjo and autoharp; Chris Tordini on bass; and Pete Robbins on alto saxophone. Mr. Sorey controlled the shape of each piece by speeding up and slowing down, or developing patterns that started crisp and spare and grew to be dense and loud. In other hands this sort of thing could be dry: the other musicians busied themselves with single notes or textures rather than developing melodic shapes. But this performance was hot with its own life force.\nIn the second half Mr. Robbins, the saxophonist, played with his own band, Centric; it included Mr. Sorey on drums, as well as Eliot Cardinaux on keyboard, Jesse Neuman on trumpet and Aryeh Kobrinski on bass. They played tightly written music, and it was a group much more rooted in a stylistic jazz history. It had the agitated hustle of Tim Berne's music, with some of Wayne Shorter's harmonic feeling in the writing, and some late-60s Miles Davis in the overall group sound, rhythmically elastic and dirtied up with distortion and wah-wah pedals.\nMr. Robbins played hard and fluidly, landing heavily on unexpected notes to give his solos funk and shape. But he wasn't playing virtuoso; it was a band of equal shares, and they built the abrupt, shuddering, wriggling music together.\nTyshawn Sorey and Oblique will perform on Tuesday and Jan. 24 at the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com. Pete Robbins and Centric will play Friday at Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com.\nMUSIC REVIEW

1816258	Wheeldon Forms A Dance Company	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE6D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Christopher Wheeldon, one of the world's most sought-after choreographers, who recently announced an end to his residency at New York City Ballet, has formed his own company, a major event in the dance world.\nThe company, Morphoses the Wheeldon Company, is to make its debut in August at the Vail International Dance Festival in Colorado, followed by four to six performances at the Sadler's Wells Theater in London in September and roughly the same number at City Center in New York in October. The company is named after a 2002 dance that Mr. Wheeldon created for City Ballet.\nIn an interview yesterday Mr. Wheeldon said performances would include a mix of his own choreography and works by others, performed by stars on loan from City Ballet and the Royal Ballet in London.\n''We're still kind of at the hopes-and-dreams stage,'' he said, adding that he had approached no one to become a permanent member. ''I don't really believe in poaching,'' he said. ''I don't even know at this stage whether I can offer them the security they need.''\nAt Vail, he said, he planned to cast couples from the Hamburg Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, San Francisco Ballet and City Ballet to dance the four pas de deux from his ''Polyphonia.''\nAmong the dancers tentatively scheduled to participate in his first season are Wendy Whelan, Sébastien Marcovici, Maria Kowroski, Sofiane Sylve and Edwaard Liang from City Ballet, and Darcey Bussell, Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobborg from the Royal Ballet, where Mr. Wheeldon has danced and choreographed.\n''None of these dancers reflect the dancers that are necessarily going to be in the company when it's formed in a more concrete way,'' he said.\nMr. Wheeldon said he would concentrate on the artistic side and focus on new works, including those by contemporary choreographers.\nFor now Lourdes Lopez, a former City Ballet principal, is handling administrative matters. The company is expected to have about 20 members and an annual budget of about $5 million.\nMr. Wheeldon declined to discuss specifics on how the company would be financed, saying only that some potential donors had shown interest. The initial performances are being presented by Vail, City Center and Sadler's Wells, which will cover the dancers' fees and serve as long-term partners of the company. He said he hoped those performances would attract interest from potential company members and donors.\nThe arrival of a new dance company is always an unusual event, given the funds needed to support an essentially money-losing endeavor. It is even rarer for an individual to establish a private company, as opposed to one sponsored by a city. But Mr. Wheeldon's stature and substantial body of work, especially at his tender age of 33, appear to be enough to attract backers.\nMr. Wheeldon said in November that he would leave City Ballet as its first resident choreographer when his contract expires in 2008. He is scheduled to choreograph two more works for it. Peter Martins, the City Ballet's ballet master in chief, said at the time that he was happy to see Mr. Wheeldon spread his wings.\nMr. Martins was in rehearsals and could not be immediately reached for comment yesterday.\nInevitably Mr. Wheeldon's company will compete for attention, donations and dancers, something Mr. Wheeldon indirectly acknowledged.\nHe said Mr. Martins gave his blessing, yet ''he understands also that this may mean some dancers will decide to come to me,'' Mr. Wheeldon said. ''That's just the way life is and the way things go.''\nHe continued, ''I'm sort of stepping into an area where people might think, 'Why does New York need another ballet company when we've already got two?' '' (In addition to City Ballet, New York is home to American Ballet Theater.) Answering his own question, he said, ''Maybe it doesn't, but I'm going to do it, and we'll see if I'm foolish or not.''\nMr. Wheeldon said he wanted to give dancers a greater voice, which is sometimes difficult in large companies like City Ballet. Referring to leaders of large companies in general, he said that casting decisions were not ''always handled in a perfectly sensitive way.''\n''My mission is to create an environment that is collaborative in all respects,'' he said.\nIn an earlier recent interview he said he could make a ''change for the better in the ballet world'' by starting a company from scratch.\n''I want to be in complete control of my personal artistic vision and goals,'' he said, ''and am not really interested in inheriting a legacy, but rather taking the opportunity to forge my own.'' Starting fresh also meant bypassing the ''big politics'' and bureaucracy of a large company, he said.\nThe idea began taking shape last summer when the San Francisco Ballet presented one of his pieces at the Lincoln Center Festival. The choreographer William Forsythe had a work on the same program, and the two spoke at length.\n''He basically told me that I needed to take a step forward on my own and do something different, and coming from him -- he is a man who has continued to invent himself -- it was immediately resonant,'' Mr. Wheeldon said.\nMr. Wheeldon received a boost from an old friend at City Ballet, Damian Woetzel, who had recently become artistic director of the Vail festival and agreed to give him a springboard there.\n''We're going to work together to further the ideas that we've been kicking around all these years,'' Mr. Woetzel said. ''It's a chance to make a real solid contribution.''\nWhile mainly making dances for City Ballet -- itself long a vehicle for George Balanchine's work -- the British-born Mr. Wheeldon has been sought out by companies around the world, including the San Francisco Ballet, the Royal Ballet, the Bolshoi Ballet and the Philadelphia Ballet.\nNews of his plans have been percolating through the dance world but were not widely known.\n''What a good idea,'' said George Steel, the executive director of the Miller Theater at Columbia University, which began expanding its dance offerings after an evening of Wheeldon choreography in the fall of 2005. ''More dancing is wonderful,'' Mr. Steel said. ''It's a huge opportunity for him to have a company he can run.''\nDance\nCorrection: January 9, 2007, Tuesday An article in The Arts on Thursday about the formation of a new dance company by the choreographer Christopher Wheeldon misstated the name of one of the companies that asked him in the past to choreograph for it. It is the Pennsylvania Ballet (based in Philadelphia), not the Philadelphia Ballet.
1816259	Bud Delp, 74, Who Trained Derby Winner Spectacular Bid	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E4D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Bud Delp, the Hall of Fame thoroughbred trainer who saddled the brilliant colt Spectacular Bid, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in 1979, died last Friday in Ellicott City, Md. He was 74.\nThe cause was cancer, the Maryland Jockey Club said.\nIn his 44 years as a head trainer, based in Maryland, Delp had 3,674 winners, ninth on the career list. He won about $41 million in purses and captured stakes races with 70 horses.\nDelp won training titles in Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Illinois, Florida and Louisiana. He won an Eclipse Award as the nation's leading trainer in 1980 and was inducted into the racing Hall of Fame at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 2002.\nDuring the 1960s and '70s, Delp was among the Big Four of Maryland trainers, together with King Leatherbury, John Tammaro and Richard Dutrow. But he had never been a presence in the nation's most prestigious races.\nThat changed when Delp took charge of the charcoal gray Spectacular Bid, bought for $37,000 as a yearling by Harry Meyerhoff of Hawksworth Farm in Maryland. Delp selected Ron Franklin, a teenager, as Spectacular Bid's jockey, and rocketed with him into the spotlight.\nSpectacular Bid won seven of nine starts as a 2-year-old. He captured the 1979 Kentucky Derby and the Preakness with ease, and when Delp saddled him for the Belmont Stakes, he was primed to become the 12th Triple Crown winner in history.\nDelp was supremely confident. ''Winning a horse race is never a formality,'' Delp said when Spectacular Bid arrived at Belmont, ''but there's no way he can lose the Belmont Stakes unless he runs into some terribly bad luck.''\nSpectacular Bid did run into bad luck, the way Delp told it.\nFranklin, 19, sent the colt to the lead briefly in the backstretch, but Spectacular Bid faded and finished third in the mile-and-a-half Belmont, the Triple Crown finale, behind Coastal and Golden Act.\nTwo days later, Delp said that on the morning of the Belmont, Spectacular Bid went lame when he stepped on a large safety pin that dropped from a leg bandage to the straw of his stall and lodged in his left front hoof. Delp said he removed the pin and suggested that while Spectacular Bid appeared sound, the mishap might have hampered him.\nDelp did not criticize the ride given Spectacular Bid, but the inexperienced Franklin might have prompted the colt too early.\nTwo weeks after the Belmont, Delp replaced Franklin with Willie Shoemaker, and Spectacular Bid went on to win all nine of his starts as a 4-year-old before being retired with 26 victories in 30 races and honors as a champion at ages 2, 3 and 4.\nA native of Creswell, Md., Grover Greer Delp, known as Bud since childhood, began working at tracks as a teenager. He saddled his first winner in 1962. Crafty Bear, his last entry, finished third in a stakes race Monday at Laurel Park in Maryland.\nDelp is survived by his wife, Regina; his sons Cleve, Doug and Gerald; a daughter, Pajeen; and two grandchildren.\nIn fall 1980, as Spectacular Bid's retirement neared, Delp reflected on his champion thoroughbred and on his own career.\n''I'm no better trainer now than I was 10 years ago, and that's a damn good one,'' Delp told The New York Times. ''When Bid heads for Kentucky this winter, I won't shed a tear. I'll say, 'Good luck, Daddy,' and I'll bring him a carrot once a year. I did my job. I'll just get right back into the action.''
1816260	Seymour Martin Lipset, Sociologist, Dies at 84	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E4D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Seymour Martin Lipset, who ignored family pressure to be a dentist and instead became a pre-eminent sociologist, political scientist and incisive theorist on American uniqueness, died on Dec. 31 in Arlington, Va. He was 84.\nThe cause was a stroke, his wife, Sydnee, said.\nMr. Lipset's convictions were shaped early, in the cauldron of leftist politics in New York City in the 1930s, a time when his poor immigrant family urged him to study dentistry in order to take over his uncle's lucrative practice. Instead, as a young Trotskyist at City College, he became fascinated with the question of why the United States never had a major socialist party.\nAs he metamorphosed from political partisan to social scientist, his quest for an answer to that question -- as well as the many others that logically followed -- resulted in dozens of books and hundreds of articles. He became known for his argument that America's ideology of individualism precluded socialism in the European form.\nFrancis Fukuyama, the political philosopher, wrote in 1997 in The New York Times Book Review that Mr. Lipset's insights into ways that America was different from other nations made him ''the most thoughtful contemporary authority on American exceptionalism.''\nMartin Walker, a British journalist writing in The Washington Post's Book World in 1996, suggested that Mr. Lipset addressed ''really interesting questions'' that seldom occurred to other Americans. Among them: ''Why you exhibit almost Iranian levels of religiosity, why Canada is so different, and why you hate turning out to vote but so enjoy joining voluntary organizations.''\nUltimately, he became a leading expert in democracy, social stratification, modernization, public opinion, the sociology of intellectual life and many other subjects. He abandoned his socialist ideology in favor of rigorous intellectual methodology, much of which he developed.\nHe became active in the conservative wing of the Democratic Party and was one of the first intellectuals to be called a neoconservative. His involvement in Jewish affairs increased as he aged: he was president of the Faculty Advisory Committee of the United Jewish Appeal and other Jewish groups.\nMr. Lipset's career was geographic as well as intellectual. He occupied prestigious academic positions at Columbia, Berkeley, Harvard, Stanford, George Mason, the Hoover Institution and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\nHe was the only person to be president of both the American Sociological Association and the American Political Science Association.\nHis ''Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics'' (1960) became a basic text in political sociology, sold 400,000 copies, was translated into 20 languages and was a finalist for the National Book Award.\nIn 1987, Michael Rogin, the political scientist, called Mr. Lipset ''the most eminent living American political sociologist.''\nMr. Lipset's father, a printer, and his mother, a seamstress, came to New York from czarist Russia. They moved to the Bronx six months after Seymour was born in Harlem on March 18, 1922. After one year at the City College of New York, he dropped his interest in dentistry in favor of history -- ''fortunately for my prospective clients,'' he wrote in the Annual Review of Sociology in 1996.\nIn that article, he wrote about meeting Gen. Colin L. Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at a cocktail party and telling the general that they had both been born in Harlem, grown up in the Bronx and graduated from City College.\n''I did not add what was more relevant, that he joined the Reserve Officers Training Corps, while I joined the youth section of Young People's Socialist League, Fourth International,'' wrote Mr. Lipset, who remained a socialist through graduate school.\nMr. Lipset studied with students who would also become great figures in intellectual circles, including Irving Howe, Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer and Irving Kristol.\nMr. Lipset's first wife, the former Elsie Braun, died in 1987. His survivors include their sons, David, of St. Paul, Minn.; and Daniel, of Cambridge, Mass.; their daughter, Carola Lipset, of Palo Alto, Calif.; and six grandchildren.\nWhen his surviving wife, the former Sydnee Guyer, asked which of his intellectual heroes' portraits he wanted for his office, Mr. Lipset mentioned Carl Hubbell, the New York Giants' star pitcher, before Alexis de Tocqueville, to whom his work often referred.\nFor the last years of his life, his wife said, Mr. Lipset was thought to be unable to speak because of the effects of an earlier stroke, at least until a visitor mispronounced the name of Jacques Derrida, the influential French philosopher. Astonishingly, Mr. Lipset corrected him.
1816261	The Building That Wouldn't Go Away	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE4D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	''THE dismantling of the Deutsche Bank building will begin this fall and -- after careful, systematic deconstruction -- it will be gone next year.''\nThe speaker was Gov. George E. Pataki. The next year was 2005.\nHe's gone. The building isn't.\nAfter a long while in which the demolition deadline at the badly contaminated former Deutsche Bank building at 130 Liberty Street seemed to be elastic, officials now say its deconstruction by the end of this year is critical to progress at the rest of the World Trade Center site.\n''Any delay imperils the overall time schedule that we've established,'' Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said yesterday.\nThat means that the 41-story tower will have to start coming down at the rate of almost one floor a week, leaving little margin for further delay.\n''We have been given assurances that the building will be down by the end of this year,'' said Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, ''assurances we are trusting since that is absolutely the latest we can accept in order to meet the Port Authority's aggressive and accountable timetable.''\nGov. Eliot Spitzer is ''confident that the demolition will proceed according to schedule,'' his press secretary, Christine Anderson, said. She added that the state ''will take every precaution while the search for human remains continues.''\nTo date, 766 remains have been recovered from the building. The first through fifth floors remain to be searched.\nCharles J. Maikish, the executive director of the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center, which has taken over the deconstruction project on what he called an ''interim basis'' from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, sounded optimistic.\n''The planning, the engineering, the sequencing, the deconstruction method, the environmental controls have all been approved by the regulators and the work is going forward,'' he said last week. (In fact, one could look over Mr. Maikish's shoulder in his 29th-floor office at 1 Liberty Plaza and watch as workers removed aluminum sheathing from the columns at the top of the former bank tower.)\n''A floor a week is achievable,'' Mr. Maikish said.\nBut there is at least one big imponderable. The state is negotiating with Bovis Lend Lease, the construction manager for the demolition project, and its subcontractor, the John Galt Corporation. The companies are seeking more money to cover expenses they had not anticipated when they submitted their bid, since the decontamination has proved far more complex and demanding than had been envisioned.\nAt issue is roughly $30 million in extra expenses and how much of that should be borne by the contractors.\nFor a few days beginning on Dec. 11, only 15 or 20 of Galt's workers, about 10 percent of the usual complement, were on the job. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation called this a walkout and said negotiations would not resume until it ended. By Dec. 15, a full crew was back at work.\nAbout the negotiations, Mary Costello, a senior vice president of Bovis, said yesterday, ''Bovis believes that the parties, exercising good faith, can resolve the issue.''\nAt first glance, it may be hard to see why the fate of the main trade center is so closely linked to an old bank tower one block south. But the sites are tightly linked -- underground -- through the Vehicular Security Center that the Port Authority plans to build on the south side of Liberty Street, an area now partly occupied by 130 Liberty Street. A series of ramps in this center will lead to the network of subterranean roadways tying the new trade center together.\nBefore the authority can build the center, it must first construct a reverse bathtub, contained by large slurry walls, to keep the groundwater out. And before it can construct the bathtub, the authority must move a large sewer line that is now under Liberty Street.\nThe relocated sewer line and part of the slurry wall run about 180 feet through the 130 Liberty Street parcel. To compress work time as much as possible, the authority plans to begin building the sewer line and the slurry wall before the tower is completely demolished, then finish the work once the tower has been razed.\nIn 2010, a year before the Vehicular Security Center is scheduled to be complete, its ramps are to be used for trucks serving the final phase of construction at Silverstein Properties' Tower 3 and Tower 4 on the main trade center site. That access is guaranteed by an agreement with Silverstein, which must, in turn, finish the towers by Dec. 31, 2011.\nThe timetable is tight. So no matter how confident officials sound in public, there are more than enough tenterhooks to go around.\nBLOCKS
1816262	Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E3D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	In a rare reprise to a rare trial, the jury that convicted a Long Island man of murder by depraved indifference last October in a drunken-driving crash that killed a limousine driver and a 7-year-old girl may be brought back to court for hearings on whether some members acted improperly during deliberations.\nIn an answer submitted on Dec. 29 to a defense motion, Robert Hayden, an assistant Nassau County district attorney, agreed that a hearing should be held to determine if jurors discussed what they believed were prior drunken-driving charges against the defendant, Martin Heidgen, 25.\nSuch accusations were not included in the evidence introduced in the five-week trial, and could be considered a contamination of the jury proceedings. Beyond that, Mr. Hayden said in his answer, that the belief of a previous drunken-driving arrest was ''not true,'' as far as he knew.\nMr. Hayden said the hearing should be limited to that issue, and rebuffed as ''irrelevant'' several other claims of impropriety raised by Mr. Heidgen's lawyer, Stephen LaMagna, as causes for setting aside the guilty verdict. Mr. LaMagna also claimed that some jurors felt pressured to vote to convict Mr. Heidgen of the most serious charge, that some discussed the case outside the jury room, and that one said she planned to write a book about it.\nThe Heidgen case was unusual because the defendant was prosecuted for a fatal drunken-driving crash under laws treating his crime as the functional equivalent of intentional murder. Such prosecutions, while not unprecedented, are considered rare and are usually brought only in the most horrific cases.\nMr. Heidgen, whose blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit, was driving the wrong way on the Meadowbrook Parkway when his pickup truck crashed head-on with a limousine taking a family home from a wedding. The crash killed the limousine driver, Stanley Rabinowitz, 59, and Katie Flynn, who had been the flower girl.\nThe girl's parents and grandparents, who were also in the limousine, suffered minor injuries.\nAfter three days of deliberations, the jury told Acting Justice Alan R. Honorof of State Supreme Court that it was deadlocked, but after he sent them back for more deliberations, reached a verdict on the fifth day.\nWithin days of the verdict, though, the jury forewoman said she had felt pressured to vote for the charge of ''murder by depraved indifference'' that Mr. Heidgen was convicted of, even though she believed he was guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter. Based on the depraved indifference conviction, Mr. Heidgen faces a minimum of 25 years in prison. Manslaughter carries a minimum of 15 years.\nMr. Heidgen's lawyer, who could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, has said that based on interviews with other jury members, he believed that some jurors browbeat the last two holdouts who thought Mr. Heidgen was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder.\n''It is fairly rare for hearings like these to be held,'' said George Goltzer, vice president of the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ''The general rule is that you don't let a jury impeach its own verdict. But if the charges are serious -- say that racism or serious misconduct was involved in the decision or something like that -- the courts have allowed it.''\nMr. Goltzer said he was not too familiar with the case, but added that evidence of ''extra-record information'' -- not part of the evidence introduced at the trial -- might qualify as serious enough to review a jury's verdict.\nJustice Honorof is expected to decide in the next few days if and when hearings should be held. A spokesman for the district attorney, Kathleen Rice, said it was expected that with the district attorney's assent, the hearings would be scheduled.
1816263	Citing 'Egregious' Conduct, Panel Removes Town Justice	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E3D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct announced yesterday that it had removed an upstate town justice for a number of improper acts, including efforts to intimidate prosecutors to keep them from complaining to the commission.\nThe commission said the justice, John T. Greaney of the Berlin Town Court in Rensselaer County, had mistreated defendants, failed to appoint lawyers for them, talked about his cases out of court, conducted his own investigations and worked in local politics even though judges are not permitted to do so.\nIn 2004, the commission said, he told an assistant district attorney that he knew a lot of powerful people in state government and that if her office filed a complaint, he would not ''go down lightly.''\nThe commission's administrator, Robert H. Tembeckjian, said ''the numerous acts of egregious misconduct'' demonstrated the justice's unfitness for the bench.\nMr. Greaney declined to comment, and the commission said he did not respond to its complaint or attend a hearing scheduled in December. A lawyer who represented the justice, Brian E. Donohue, said he would not appeal. ''We came to the conclusion,'' Mr. Donohue said, ''that we really did not have a defense to at least some of the charges.''\nMr. Donohue said Mr. Greaney, 71, did not know that sitting judges are barred from political activities for other candidates when he circulated petitions to get candidates on the ballot in 2004. A part-time instructor at a community college, he was elected to the town court in 2003.\nThe commission said the petitions contained fraudulent entries, including a faked signature. Mr. Donohue declined to discuss the details.\nThe commission has moved frequently against town and village justices, who preside in small courts around the state. Last year, 6 of the more than 1,250 justices were either removed from office for serious misconduct or resigned while facing charges. The Legislature is examining possible changes in the court system after widespread criticism.\nLike three-quarters of the justices, Mr. Greaney is not a lawyer. But he has deep political ties, and has long been active in Republican politics in Berlin, a town of 1,900 people east of Troy.\nThe decision announced yesterday included a catalog of injudicious behavior. It said Mr. Greaney had questioned a defendant without his lawyer present, called a defendant a liar based on information the justice had heard outside court, and told a police officer to threaten a defendant with jail time unless he became an informer.\nWhen the justice addressed a group of students who knew a schoolmate facing charges in his court, the commission said, ''he told them they would not be seeing Corey for a long time'' because he was going to get the maximum sentence.\nAnd when Justice Greaney came to believe that the county district attorney's office was preparing to file a complaint, the commission said, his response was explicit. He closed the door of his office and told the prosecutor he knew her office was trying to get him removed, the commission said.\nHe mentioned that he had been the Republican town chairman for 20 years. He said he would never talk to the prosecutor again. And he mentioned, the commission said, that he had ties to powerful people and sat on a state panel that gives grants to local prosecutors.
1816264	Ford Is Buried After Thousands in Hometown Pay Respects	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E3D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Gerald R. Ford was buried on Wednesday on a grassy hill beside the rushing waters of the Grand River as the sun set, a final farewell in a week of remembrances for the nation's 38th president.\nThough Mr. Ford had lived elsewhere for decades, Grand Rapids made it clear that it still considered this his true home and that it still considered him one of its most beloved, famous -- and yet ordinary -- men.\nIn a city of 195,000 residents, some 57,000 waited since Tuesday evening in a line that wound through two miles of downtown to walk silently past Mr. Ford's coffin inside his presidential museum, steps from where he would be buried.\nIn temperatures that dipped into the low 30s, some people cheerfully waited six hours, deep into the night and morning, for a minute or two beside the former president, who died on Dec. 26 at age 93.\n''We needed to be here -- this is how we feel about him here,'' Mary Castro said shortly before 3 a.m. Wednesday, still waiting to reach the museum after four hours in line. A family, carrying a 2-year-old in blankets beside her, nodded.\n''He was an everyday, down-to-earth guy, so accessible, not one of these politicians nowadays who needs all sorts of bodyguards,'' said Ms. Castro, 62, of suburban Comstock Park. ''And he understood the importance of forgiveness.''\nIf the nation remembered Mr. Ford for his sudden arrival as president in 1974 in the midst of turmoil over the Watergate scandal and for his decision to pardon President Richard M. Nixon, Grand Rapids's memory was utterly different. Here, he was the boy who grew up on these streets, who played football for South High School, who became an Eagle Scout and who this region sent to the House of Representatives from 1949 until the 1970s.\nHe had taken the time to speak to elementary school government classes, to write birthday cards, to present crowns to homecoming queens. He was, some said, a perfect reflection of what people here are about.\n''He was one of us,'' said Dwayne Hiljer, 69 and a retired salesman who drove three hours from his home near Detroit. ''I've been around for presidents since Roosevelt, and this is the only one that was always totally honest with you.''\nEven after Mr. Ford's body was driven away from the museum -- the lines cut short when time ran out -- Grand Rapids followed him. Residents lined the streets, Boy Scouts in uniforms (and no coats) saluting, as his hearse and motorcade led the way to a final funeral service. The city gathered again along the bridges and the roofs of downtown buildings at dusk when the burial service began.\nMr. Ford was actually born in Omaha, but moved here as an infant with his mother. He had lived, at various times, in eight homes in the area.\nDuring the funeral at Grace Episcopal Church, gleaming with stained glass, in East Grand Rapids, mourners remembered his modest roots and modest approach.\n''There's an old saying in Washington that every member of the United States Congress looks in the mirror and sees a future president,'' Donald H. Rumsfeld, who served as defense secretary and chief of staff to Mr. Ford, said in a eulogy. ''Well, Jerry Ford was different. I suspect that when he looked in the mirror even after he became president, he saw a citizen and a public servant.''\nThe Fords had been longtime members of the church. Mr. Ford married his wife, Betty, at the parish's earlier building in 1948. Their first three children were baptized there. The funerals for Mr. Ford's mother and stepfather were held there.\nThe service on Wednesday, before 400 people, was more intimate, more personal than some earlier events.\nMr. Ford's grandchildren read prayers. Honorary pallbearers included a list of community leaders and friends from Grand Rapids, as well as Jack Nicklaus, the golfer; Mary Sue Coleman, the University of Michigan president; and Pepi Gramshammer, the skier. A University of Michigan blanket, yellow and blue, was left on a pew in honor of Bo Schembechler, the longtime Michigan football coach whom Mr. Ford had chosen to be an honorary pallbearer but who died late last year. Mr. Ford played for Michigan in the 1930s.\nRichard Norton Smith, who used to be the director of the Ford museum and presidential library, described a man who knew how to laugh at himself and to get along despite divisiveness and partisanship.\n''No one ever called Gerald Ford an imperial president,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Perhaps that was because no figure in memory was so immune to Washington's besetting disease of self-importance.''\nMr. Ford, a longtime member of Congress, succeeded Vice President Spiro T. Agnew and then Mr. Nixon after both men left office because of scandals.\nFormer President Jimmy Carter, who defeated Mr. Ford in 1976 but later became his close friend, said the precise words he used in his own inauguration -- 30 years ago -- remained the most appropriate tribute he could make to Mr. Ford, whose decision to pardon Mr. Nixon had drawn angry critics as well as supporters, who said he had helped spare the country more turmoil.\n''For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor,'' Mr. Carter said on Wednesday, pausing to gather his emotions, ''for all he did to heal our land.''\nAs dusk fell on a cold, clear afternoon, Mr. Ford's family, emotional and holding on to one another, gathered for the burial outside the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum, near the grass beside the Grand River. The Army chorus somberly sang ''Goin' Home.'' The Rev. Dr. Robert G. Certain said a prayer. Canons sent a cloud of thick smoke and loud echoes across a silent downtown. F-15s zipped loudly past in formation, traveling north along the river's edge.\nVice President Dick Cheney handed the flag -- the carefully folded flag from Mr. Ford's coffin -- to Mrs. Ford, who nodded and clutched it briefly to her face.
1816265	U.S. Requiring Port Workers To Have ID's And Reviews	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E3D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	More than 750,000 port workers will be required to have criminal background and immigration checks in an antiterrorism program that the Homeland Security Department announced on Wednesday, and industry leaders say the effort could disrupt port traffic nationally.\nSince shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, work has been under way on a tamperproof card, the Transportation Worker Identification Credential, that workers will receive after passing the reviews.\nThe Homeland Security Department this week issued 469 pages of final rules for the program, which is intended to make it harder for terrorists to sneak into secure port areas.\nStarting in March, workers like longshoremen and truck drivers will have to apply for the card, which will include a fingerprint and a digital photograph.\nThe applicants will have to prove that they are legally working in the United States. They also cannot have been convicted of any terrorism-related crimes like spying, sedition or treason, as well as other charges like murder, improper transport of hazardous materials or illegal possession or purchase of explosives.\nAnyone convicted in the past seven years of a much longer list of crimes like possession of illegal firearms, bribery, arson, robbery or extortion will have to seek a waiver before obtaining a card. People involuntarily committed to mental health centers because of drug or alcohol addiction will have to prove that they have successfully completed rehabilitation.\nIndustry officials say the restrictions may disqualify thousands of workers, particularly truck drivers, based on estimates that a signification segment of the drivers may be working here illegally.\nUnion leaders have said workers with criminal records who have served their time or paid fines might lose their jobs.\n''We don't want to keep people who are not a terrorist risk to be kept from doing their job,'' said Steve Stallone, a spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.\nKip Hawley, assistant secretary of the Transportation Security Administration, said in an interview Wednesday that he was confident that the effects would be modest. Drivers of trucks carrying hazardous materials have similar background checks, with 1 percent disqualified, Mr. Hawley said.\n''We do not anticipate this will be a huge issue,'' he added.\nThe government has expanded the appeals process so workers with criminal histories can present their cases to an administrative law judge.\nThe cards will first be issued at a few ports and then expand over 18 months until they cover the nation's estimated 770,000 maritime workers.\nApplicants will have to pay up to $159 for the card, which will be good for five years. Over all, the government estimates that the program will cost $1.8 billion over the next decade, factoring in related costs like paying escorts required for people without cards who need to enter secure port areas.
1816266	The Sky Wasn't Falling, Just a Tiny Chunk of It	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E2D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Whatever it was, the object that fell from the sky was not part of an airplane. That was all anyone knew for sure.\nIt was dense with a rough metallic surface. The oblong object was only about two inches long -- fitting into the palm of a hand -- but weighed almost a pound. And it fell through the roof of a two-story house here Tuesday afternoon, shattering the tile floor of the second-floor bathroom and embedding itself in a wall.\n''No one was injured,'' said Lt. Robert Brightman of the Freehold Township Police Department at a press conference Wednesday while discussing the possibly extraterrestrial event. His investigators had put the object, whatever it was, in a plastic cylinder, where it sat on a bed of aqua blue Styrofoam inside the cylinder.\nFlanked by a detective and a representative from the local emergency management office, Lieutenant Brightman said that after the object entered the home in a housing development here (passing through shingles and sheathing and insulation), a test with a Geiger counter indicated that at least it was not radioactive.\n''Would you call that kidney-shaped?'' a reporter asked. The officer said he did not know.\nSpecialists in the field were testing the small, dense object, the lieutenant said, although he declined to say who the specialists were. All he would say was that the specialists were expert in ''investigating unusual objects of this type.'' Then the lieutenant threw out a tantalizing word: ''Quadrantids'' -- meteor showers that peak in January when northern skies are cold and cloudy.\n''Actually, you can see them around Jan. 1 to the 6th,'' said Gareth Williams, an astronomer at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, based in Cambridge, Mass. ''In a good year, there are 100 meteors an hour.''\nIt seemed like a solid clue, at least until Mr. Williams added, ''I am unaware of any case where a meteorite is proven to have fallen as a result of a meteor shower.''\nMany meteorites fall to earth every day, Mr. Williams said, most of them into the sea or the vast unpopulated parts of the earth. Once or twice a year, they hit a house or a car, he added.\nLieutenant Brightman did not identify the family whose house was struck by the object, except to say that it was in the Colt's Pride development.\nHe said that a woman who lives there with her husband and son said that they heard a noise on Tuesday afternoon, and that her son found the object in the bathroom later that night. But they waited until Wednesday morning to notify the police.\nUntil the tests are completed, perhaps in a few days, the officer said, the object would remain in the custody of an officer.
1816267	Comptroller Voices Concern About Brooklyn Golf Deal	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E2D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	A $9.6 million city contract to renovate and operate a golf course in Marine Park in Brooklyn was headed for further review yesterday after the city comptroller raised concerns about ties between the contractor and a man accused of being a soldier in the Colombo crime family.\nIn a letter sent Tuesday, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. urged the Parks and Recreation Department to reconsider the 20-year concession contract with East Coast Golf. Mr. Thompson cited references in federal court papers to the company's president, Dominick Logozzo, and his financial relationship with Craig Marino, whom federal prosecutors describe as ''a soldier in the Colombo family.''\nMr. Marino was one of 10 reputed mob members indicted in March on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges in connection with a stock fraud scheme that allegedly bilked investors of more than $20 million. Prosecutors contend that he has a long, violent history, including beatings and stabbings, according to court documents.\nMr. Logozzo, who has not been implicated in any criminal activity cited in the indictment, was awarded a 20-year contract on Jan. 1, 2006, to operate the city-owned Marine Park Golf Course. The 18-hole course is one of a dozen city courses, all operated by private vendors, said Warner Johnston, a department spokesman.\nMr. Johnston said the contract was awarded before the indictments were filed and complied with all ''the relevant legal requirements.'' But because of the concerns expressed by the comptroller, the department has asked the city's Law Department and the Department of Investigation to review the contract.\nMr. Logozzo did not return phone calls left at his place of business yesterday.\nIn pretrial detention documents filed in March, Mr. Marino's lawyer, Joseph R. Corozzo, wrote that his client and Mr. Logozzo were childhood friends, and that Mr. Logozzo had lent Mr. Marino's father $48,000 to invest in a food service company known as the Zone Diet.\nThat investment, Mr. Corozzo wrote, has been the son's sole source of recent income. Mr. Corozzo did not return phones calls left at his office yesterday. In court documents, the lawyer said Mr. Logozzo has an ''unimpeachable background.''\nIn addition to the loan, documents filed by the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York State said that Mr. Logozzo is the registered owner of a Lincoln Navigator that Mr. Marino drives.\nMr. Thompson said those financial relationships gave ''rise to numerous integrity concerns about the concessionaire.''\nAccording to Parks Department documents, Mr. Logozzo's contract calls for it to pay the city a minimum of $9.6 million in fees over 20 years. It also offered to pay additional fees for a restaurant and banquet center.\nThe company beat out four other bidders to win the contract, including one proposal that offered a minimum $10.35 million in fees. Mr. Johnston said the fee offer was just one of several factors used to assess the proposals.\nMr. Johnston said East Coast Golf's contract called for the company to invest $4.4 million in capital improvements in the course over 20 years. The company has already invested about $1 million, he said.\nThough the contract was awarded on Jan. 1, 2006, the Parks Department did not submit the agreement to the comptroller, who must register the contract, until November.\nThe concerns about the golf course contract come as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is seeking to restrict powers of the comptroller and borough presidents to approve city deals with vendors. The change is part of a series of measures that would include eliminating background checks of vendors in some circumstances until they have been awarded their contracts.\nAdministration officials say the proposed changes are part of an overall movement to streamline the way contracts are awarded and bring more transparency to a process that has been subject to corruption and inefficiency.\nMr. Thompson, who is critical of the change, has said it would give him and the borough presidents much less opportunity to catch things like potential mob ties, bankruptcies and other financial problems with would-be vendors.
1816268	Tennessee's Tax on Illegal Drugs Nets $3.5 Million	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E2D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Tennessee has collected nearly $3.5 million since it began enforcing its tax on illegal drugs two years ago, officials from the Department of Revenue said Wednesday.\nThe state's Unauthorized Substances Tax, passed by the Legislature in 2004, requires anyone in possession of an illegal drug to buy and affix stamps to the drugs' packaging.\nUnder the law, information provided to the Department of Revenue to buy stamps cannot be used in criminal prosecutions. There is a toll-free number for stamp application requests, and stamps are doled out based on type of drug and weight.\nAs is the case in some two dozen other states with similar laws, however, the stamps have become curiosities bought by collectors and lobbyists who campaigned for the bill.\nOf the 726 stamps sold so far, none have turned up on seized drugs, said Loren Chumley, commissioner of revenue for the State of Tennessee.\nWhile many think that the idea is inspired, others object to it.\n''It's almost like the law wasn't written to be construed seriously,'' said Gregory P. Isaacs, a lawyer in Knoxville. ''It's like asking for someone to get a special permit before they drive drunk.''\nThe real money the law generates comes from penalties assessed on people caught with unstamped drugs. Fines may equal up to 10 times the amount of the tax, and are vigorously collected, Mr. Isaacs said.\nBecause the taxes can be collected based on a preponderance of evidence, rather than a determination of guilt, defense lawyers are challenging the law, saying it violates the guarantee against double jeopardy and the right to due process.\nIn one case in July, an appellate court ruled that the law was unconstitutional. That decision is being appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court.
1816269	Below Haze, Saturn's Biggest Moon Has Lakes	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E2D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	As scientists have predicted but have had a hard time proving, the surface of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, appears to be dotted with lakes of liquid methane. The lakes are more intriguing evidence of the active phenomena at play on the only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere.\nThe discovery, reported yesterday by an international team of researchers, was made by a radar survey of Titan's high northern latitudes by the Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting Saturn and its retinue of satellites since July 2004. One of the mission's major objectives is the investigation of Titan's environment, thought to be a frigid version of conditions on the primordial Earth.\nThe radar imaging system detected more than 75 dark patches in the landscape near Titan's northern polar region, the scientists said in a detailed description of the find published today in the journal Nature.\nThe patches, they said, indicated smooth surfaces in an otherwise rugged topography, suggesting lake beds either partly dry or filled with liquid. These smooth surfaces, more or less circular and with diameters ranging from 2 miles to 40 miles, are associated with channels that appear to have been formed by flowing liquids, presumably tributaries to the lakes.\nMethane exists in Titan's atmosphere and, in the extreme cold of high latitudes, is expected to rain on the surface and be present as liquids in subsurface reservoirs.\nThe radar images, made on a close pass of Saturn's largest moon by the Cassini spacecraft in July, ''provide definitive evidence for the presence of lakes on the surface of Titan,'' the discovery team concluded.\nWhen the spacecraft conducted its first radar search above 70 degrees north latitude, Ellen R. Stofan, leader of the team, said in an interview, ''We saw a huge swath of the surface just covered with lakes, like Minnesota.''\nDr. Stofan is a planetary scientist at Proxemy Research, a contractor in Virginia to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and also at University College London. Other team members include researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which directs the Cassini mission; the University of Arizona; and several European institutions.\nIn an accompanying article in the journal, Christophe Sotin, a planetary scientist at the University of Nantes in France who was not involved in the research, wrote that the lakes and other mission findings were strong evidence that ''methane on Titan plays the role of water on Earth.'' It is the second-most abundant component of Titan's atmosphere, after nitrogen.\nThe discovery, Dr. Sotin concluded, adds to the ''weight of evidence'' that processes on and beneath Titan's surface must be similar to those dominating the early evolution of any Earth-like planet.\n''As far as we know, there is only one planetary body that displays more dynamism than Titan,'' he wrote. ''Its name is Earth.''\nFinding large bodies of liquid methane and probably ethane on Titan, in lakes or perhaps vast seas, had long been hypothesized, based on telescope observations of that moon's smoggy methane-rich atmosphere and by the two Voyager spacecraft that passed close some 30 years ago. But the Cassini remote-sensing instruments had failed to detect an ocean, though they and the European Space Agency's Huygens lander did find traces of the channels where liquids had apparently flowed across the surface.\nOn Cassini's previous encounters with Titan, the smog-penetrating radar found no smaller liquid bodies, until it observed the region from 70 degrees north latitude to 83 degrees north latitude. At present, it is winter in Titan's north. Methane is one of the few molecules to exist as a liquid in such cold conditions, scientists said, and is the most plausible explanation for the smooth, dark surfaces in the radar images.\nDr. Stofan said that the lake depressions could be volcanic craters or sinkholes; very few craters gouged out by meteorite impacts have been detected on Titan. Their roughly circular shapes and steep-sided rims are typical of volcanic depressions. Surface collapses, as in sinkholes, could fill the lakes with liquids from interior chambers, like aquifers on Earth.\nIn both cases, scientists said, methane vapor condensing and raining out of the cold Titan sky was probably a significant source of the liquid in the lakes.\nJonathan I. Lunine of the University of Arizona, another member of the discovery team, described in an interview what the lakes probably look like. The methane liquid would be transparent, enough to see the dark hydrocarbon sediments on the floor of shallow lakes. The liquid would be less viscous than water, perhaps like gasoline.

1816270	Iran's President Promises More Nuclear Fuel and a Celebration	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned Wednesday that Iran would not back down from its nuclear ambitions and said his country would soon start producing nuclear fuel on an industrial scale.\n''Iran has the fuel cycle, and very soon we will push the button on nuclear fuel production for industrial uses,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said in a speech in the southern city of Ghotvand in Khuzestan Province, according to the ISNA news agency.\nThe United Nations Security Council passed a resolution late last month banning the trade of goods and technology that could benefit Iran's uranium enrichment, reprocessing and ballistic missile systems. Enriched uranium can be used for making nuclear weapons or as fuel for nuclear energy plants.\nThe resolution gave Iran a two-month deadline to suspend its enrichment program, but Iran says that it has the right to enrich uranium as a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\n''The Iranian people will not retreat one iota from their rights,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad vowed Wednesday, adding that Iran would celebrate its nuclear achievements in February, on the 28th anniversary of the victory of the Iranian revolution of 1979.\n''The Iranian people have made their decision to continue this path wisely and will not pay attention to empty cries of the materialists and the bullying of the decadent powers,'' he said.\nOther senior officials have also warned that Iran will not surrender in the face of pressure.\nAkbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, an influential cleric and the head of the Expediency Council, warned last week that pressing Iran could have consequences.\n''This is a very dangerous resolution,'' he said during Friday Prayer at Tehran University. ''They are creating problems for themselves and the region,'' he said, adding that ''many will suffer from the smoke of this fire.''\nOne former nuclear negotiator for Iran, Hossein Moussavian, warned the nation's current negotiators on Wednesday that ignoring the resolution and calling it illegal would not help. He said the resolution could have severe consequences for Iran, ISNA reported. ''We can say inside the country that this resolution is illegal, but we have to have a correct understanding of the international community's considerations,'' he was quoted as saying.
1816271	Kenya Closes Border but Denies Turning Back Refugees	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E1D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Kenyan officials announced Wednesday that they were closing their northern border because of the conflict in Somalia, but denied that they had turned back hundreds of refugees.\nFor the past few days, Ethiopian-led forces have been hunting down the remnants of Somalia's once powerful Islamist movement, pushing fighters steadily south toward the Kenyan border. Ethiopian officials have said the Islamist fighters are headed to a remote jungle outpost called Ras Kamboni, which terrorism suspects have used before as a hide-out.\nIt now seems that Somalia's problems have sucked in yet another country, and with the final throes of the conflict on their doorstep, Kenyan officials said they had no choice but to act.\n''We needed to close the border so we could closely vet all refugees,'' said Alfred N. Mutua, a spokesman for the Kenyan government.\nBut Mr. Mutua denied news reports and accusations from United Nations officials that Kenyan border guards had deported 600 Somalis seeking asylum, saying that the closing applied only to cross-border trade and nonrefugee traffic, to prevent the Islamists from slipping into the country.\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres told Agence France-Presse on Wednesday that Kenya ''has a humanitarian obligation to allow civilians at risk to seek asylum on its territory.''\nMr. Mutua said that 10 foreign Islamist fighters were caught Monday trying to cross the border in a throng of refugees. The fighters were carrying briefcases packed with cash. Kenyan officials said they probably had been financiers of Somalia's Islamist movement, which was routed last week by Ethiopian soldiers supporting Somalia's transitional government.\nAs hundreds of Somalis continue to line up at the border each day, hoping for asylum, Kenya has buttressed its patrols with extra troops and helicopters. Residents on the Kenyan side of the border have reported skirmishes in Kenya, but Mr. Mutua said that was not the case.\n''We're just trying to make sure none of the problems from Somalia spill across the border, and so far none has,'' he said.\nIn Mogadishu, Somalia's battle-scarred capital, several weapons were collected Wednesday in the transitional government's drive to disarm one of the most heavily armed citizenries in the world. On Monday, Ali Mohammed Gedi, the transitional prime minister, issued one of his first edicts, demanding that Somali warlords and gunmen turn in their military-grade weapons by Thursday. If they did not, he said, homes would be searched.\nElders from one of Mogadishu's more powerful subclans turned over a pickup truck equipped with an antiaircraft gun and 20 young fighters. Transitional government officials said the weapons and men would be folded into Somalia's new national army.\nMeanwhile, Islamist leaders continued to insist that they had not been defeated.\n''I cannot say where we are, but we are in Somalia and we are not afraid anymore,'' Abdulrahim Ali Modei, the Islamists' spokesman, said Wednesday in a telephone call to a Somali radio station.
1816272	Chávez Plans One Big Venezuela Leftist Party, Led by Him	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E1D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	President Hugo Chávez has begun forging a single Socialist party among his varied supporters, one of his recent efforts to create momentum for far-reaching changes to Venezuela's political system that analysts say will effectively concentrate greater political power in his hands.\nMr. Chávez formally announced the plan for the single party, called the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, in a speech last month to supporters here. He reminded them of his 23-percentage-point margin of victory when he was re-elected last month to a six-year term.\n''Those votes don't belong to any party.'' Mr. Chávez said. ''They belong to Chávez and the people.''\nSince then the swiftness and boldness of Mr. Chávez's attempt to create such a large party tied so closely to his personal leadership have created concern, even among sympathetic political analysts, that the step would effectively turn Venezuela into a one-party state.\nIn an essay published on Aporrea, an influential pro-Chávez blog, Edgardo Lander, a sociologist at the Central University of Venezuela, questioned the reasoning behind forming a single political party described as Socialist when the definition of the ''21st-century Socialism'' that Mr. Chávez aspires to build remained extremely vague.\n''Isn't the cart being placed in front of the ox?'' Mr. Lander wrote. ''What future, from the point of view of pluralism and democracy, lies ahead for a political organization decreed in this fashion?''\nAnalysts more critical of Mr. Chávez have drawn a parallel with Fidel Castro's successful effort to create a single ruling party in Cuba in the early 1960s.\nMr. Chávez has tried to assuage concerns that his project would lead to authoritarianism by saying party leaders would largely be chosen by his rank-and-file supporters, an idea lambasted by critics here. ''His tireless finger won't stop singling out those who are going to be the bosses,'' said Teodoro Petkoff, the editor of the opposition-aligned newspaper Tal Cual.\nSome of Mr. Chávez's supporters say the creation of a single party would strengthen the government's hand in combating excessive bureaucracy and corruption stemming from the need to distribute political spoils to an array of different parties. Others view the new party as a way to remain ahead of a fractious opposition.\nThe move has already revealed tensions within the coalition of more than 20 political parties that currently supports the president. Critics of the plan say it could marginalize relatively small pro-Chávez parties that support an open economy, existing government institutions and a pluralistic political system.\nBy contrast, much of the support comes from more hard-line members of Mr. Chávez's own party, the Fifth Republic Movement, which was dissolved last month to make way for its larger successor.\nSome of those supporters want to strengthen parallel political institutions created by Mr. Chávez, like a system of health clinics and universities closely tied to the president and his Socialist project for the nation.\nFor instance, he has announced a plan to build as many as 50 new universities, expected to be modeled on the three-year-old Bolivarian University of Venezuela, which provides Socialist-inspired, tuition-free classes to more than 170,000 students.\n''We're witnessing a struggle between two ideological currents within the Chavista movement,'' said Steve Ellner, a political scientist at University of the East in Venezuela.\nSome of the strongest resistance comes from Mr. Chávez's allies on the far left. The Communist Party, in particular, stands to lose considerable stature if it folds into the new party, though it is expected to do so.\nThe Communists have weathered decades of persecution and the collapse of the Soviet Union. ''The Communist Party was created to defend the workers and should continue this struggle,'' Jerónimo Carrera, a senior party official, told the newspaper El Nacional.\nMr. Chávez's critics on the left and right regularly say he is carrying out a ''fake revolution'' exemplified by a boom in consumer spending on imported goods and the distribution of economic favors and government contracts to those who support his oil-financed administration.\nBut Mr. Chávez has also created thousands of agricultural and industrial cooperatives. And he has expanded the influence of ''communal councils,'' groups of 20 or so people in poor areas who make routine planning decisions and are financed by small communal banks. He said recently that he would put $2 billion at the disposal of these councils in 2007.\nHe still runs the risk, however remote, of losing one or two smaller but important parties in his coalition. These parties, which include Podemos and Fatherland for All, are expected to decide this month whether to join the new party.\nAs Mr. Chávez presses forward with that party, he seems eager to imbue senior officials with a greater understanding of Socialist ideology, as well as closer allegiance to his own wishes.\nLate last year, legislators in the National Assembly, controlled by supporters of Mr. Chávez, were enrolled in classes on Marxist analysis and socialist thinking taught by professors from the National Armed Forces Experimental University.\nSignaling a desire for even his highest-ranking allies to fall into step with what he calls his Bolivarian Revolution, Mr. Chávez publicly dressed down Vice President José Vicente Rangel and Interior Minister Jesse Chacón last month.\nThe reason? They let an orchestra omit the Panamanian anthem from an act honoring Simón Bolívar, the South American independence leader, who died 176 years ago.\n''We have to struggle against such inefficiency,'' Mr. Chávez said in comments broadcast on the state television. ''What a shame to have such disorganization for such a sublime event,'' he added, as a small crowd in attendance applauded.
1816273	The Neediest Cases; After String of Crises, a Family Finds Some Security	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	When Destiny-Rae was quiet at 18 months old, Delores Pryce knew that something was wrong. ''All my children talked early,'' she said. ''But she wasn't speaking.''\nThe problem, as Ms. Pryce discovered, was that her daughter could not hear. The fluid in her ears was not draining properly. An operation to install tubes to drain the fluid in each ear solved the hearing problem.\nToday, as she turns 7 years old, Destiny-Rae is a chatty, bubbly first grader who likes to read. ''I read all kinds of books,'' she said.\nDestiny-Rae's premature birth came with medical complications and a wrenching change of address that turned the lives of Ms. Pryce, now 43, and her family upside down.\nIn December 1999, Ms. Pryce was pregnant with Destiny-Rae and visiting New York with her three children, Misty-Lee, Keano-Ross and Marie-Chantal, then ages 3 through 10. She was on vacation from her native England after fleeing a tumultuous marriage. She had planned to return home shortly after the new year.\nOn Jan. 4, 2000, Destiny-Rae was born two months early. ''When she came out she was red and then, all of a sudden, she turned blue,'' Ms. Pryce remembered. ''She wasn't able to breathe.''\nDestiny-Rae spent 16 days in the hospital and was released weighing little more than four pounds. Ms. Pryce was stranded in New York with four children, one of them a fragile newborn.\n''The hospital wouldn't let me fly home,'' she said.\nThe family was staying with friends, but the arrangement soured, leaving the entire Pryce family homeless. Ms. Pryce gathered her children and entered a Brooklyn shelter.\nDestiny-Rae was in and out of Kings County Hospital Center five times before her first birthday, for pneumonia and other complications. Ms. Pryce and her three children traveled by subway from their Brooklyn shelter to visit her daily. The family lived in a shelter during the next four years. Destiny-Rae had emotional and behavioral issues, including hyperactivity, a sensitivity to touch and a quick temper.\nThen, in September 2004, Tabernacle Church in Jamaica, Queens, offered a lifeline. Ms. Pryce had been a member of the Baptist congregation for three years. The church offered her a small two-bedroom apartment above its small worship space and set the rent at $250 a month.\n''It looked like a bomb hit it,'' Ms. Pryce said. ''We cleaned it up. We did our bit.'' The apartment today is furnished with worn, hand-me-down furniture. Amy and Patrick, the family parakeets, fly around the living room.\nDestiny-Rae pointed to two paper certificates for perfect school attendance in October. ''This is Misty's perfect attendance; this is mine,'' she said.\nMs. Pryce lives here with Destiny-Rae and Misty-Lee, 10, who is in fifth grade. Her eldest daughter, 17, is in college in England, where students typically start college classes at 16. Her son, Keano-Ross, is living there with Ms. Pryce's parents and doing well in fourth grade.\nThe apartment was a huge step toward stability, but paying the electricity bill was a new hurdle.\n''They sent me a bill when I first came here and I paid that bill,'' Ms. Pryce remembered.\nThen, she said, Consolidated Edison sent no bills for months. The Con Ed office is across the street from Destiny-Rae's weekly play therapy, and Ms. Pryce said that she inquired there regularly about her bill. She was told that Con Ed did not have her account information. About a year and a half later, she received a $1,600 electricity bill.\nThe family income is limited to $626 a month from Destiny's Supplemental Security income and supplemented by $152 in food stamps, and a $20 stipend from the church food pantry, where Ms. Pryce also volunteers twice a week. She also picks up baby-sitting jobs, and works one day a week at a neighborhood grocery.\nMs. Pryce managed to pay $500 toward the electric bill. But in October, Con Ed threatened to remove the meter, and she asked for help to pay the remaining balance.\nShe turned to Keiko Aizawa, a social worker at New Alternatives for Children, which provides preventive services for families with medically fragile children. The program is run by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.\nMs. Aizawa, who has been involved with the family since Destiny-Rae's ear surgery more than five years ago, found money to pay off the remaining $1,100 on the electricity bill, $500 of which was Neediest Cases money.\n''You guys came through for me. I'm not going back in the shelter,'' said Ms. Pryce, who is grateful for Ms. Aizawa's continued support.\nThings are looking up. Destiny-Rae receives physical, occupational and speech therapy each week and is catching up academically. ''By the age of 8 or 9, she should be up to par and out of special ed,'' Ms. Aizawa said.\nMs. Pryce hopes to find a full-time job now that two of her girls are in school here, and she said that she is finally beginning to feel more secure.\n''I've got the sense that I'm safe here,'' she said. ''Everything will be all right. They've got better as things have gone along.''\nIn her bedroom, Misty-Lee pulled out some princess decorations and pink paper wall hangings that Ms. Aizawa gave the girls a few months ago. ''We're going to put it up soon,'' she said.\nPreviously recorded: $4,513,938.29 Recorded Tuesday: 134,028.54 Total: $4,647,966.83 Last year to date: $4,776,625.76\nHOW TO HELP\nChecks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245, or any of these organizations:\nBROOKLYN BUREAU OF COMMUNITY SERVICE 285 Schermerhorn Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES, DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS 191 Joralemon Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK 1011 First Avenue New York, N.Y. 10022\nCHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nFEDERATION OF PROTESTANT WELFARE AGENCIES 281 Park Avenue South New York, N.Y. 10010\nUJA-FEDERATION OF NEW YORK Church Street Station P.O.

1816274	The Democrats' Cautious Tiptoe Around the President's Tax Cuts	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE1D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	President Bush is all but daring Democratic leaders to attack his signature tax cuts as they take over Congress. But Democrats, perhaps to his frustration, are having none of it.\nIn an opening salvo on Wednesday, Mr. Bush proclaimed that he would present a budget next month that manages to project a balanced budget by 2012 while permanently extending more than $1 trillion in tax cuts.\n''It is also a fact that our tax cuts have fueled robust economic growth and record revenues,'' Mr. Bush wrote in an op-ed article for The Wall Street Journal. ''We met our goal of cutting the deficit in half three years ahead of schedule.''\nThe implicit message, which Republican lawmakers reinforced later, was that their tax cuts were popular with voters, that Republicans had proven the economic benefits of tax cuts and that Democrats would court disaster if they even hinted at rolling them back or repealing them.\nBut even as Democratic leaders continue to accuse Mr. Bush of having a reckless fiscal policy, they have refused to discuss dismantling his tax cuts or even to engage in a debate with him about the best way to stimulate economic growth.\n''It's always the same old tired line with them -- 'Tax and spend, tax and spend, tax and spend,' '' said Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ''We're not going there.''\nAt least not now. Democratic leaders say they see no need to revisit Mr. Bush's tax cuts for several years because they are not set to expire until the end of 2010. And they contend that the government could increase revenues as much as $100 billion a year simply by closing the ''tax gap,'' taxes that are owed but not paid.\nWhen asked about their tax plans, as they have been again and again since Nov. 7, Democratic leaders insist they want to preserve many of the middle-class tax cuts like the child tax credit and a reduction in the so-called ''marriage penalty'' for two-income households.\nThe Democrats' coyness is less than candid. Although it is true that Mr. Bush's tax cuts have four more years of life, it is also true that Congress faces serious fiscal headaches that cannot be postponed for even a full year.\nOne of those challenges is the Iraq war. The conflict is likely to cost far more than $100 billion this year, even if the United States began reducing troop levels.\nSo far, Mr. Bush has kept war spending out of the regular budget request that he sends to Congress each February, instead seeking the money on an expedited as-needed basis.\nDemocrats say, however, that they will not accede to such requests, as their Republican predecessors did, because they sidestep the process by which Congress normally debates spending priorities.\nPerhaps the bigger and more enduring problem is the alternative minimum tax, a tax that was originally intended for the richest households but that has been not adjusted for inflation and is rapidly engulfing tens of millions of middle-class families every year.\nTo prevent the alternative tax from becoming a de facto tax increase, Congress has been passing temporary fixes for the last several years. Those fixes now cost more than $50 billion a year, and the cost is expected to climb sharply for the rest of the decade.\nRepealing the alternative minimum tax, a goal shared by Democrats and Republicans, would reduce government revenues by about $1 trillion over the next 10 years and would be a huge drain on the Treasury that nobody in either party has figured out how to finance.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have a wish list of their own. House Democrats plan to reduce interest rates on student loans by half as part of their plan to pass measures that they have long favored in the first 100 legislative hours.\nDemocrats also want to funnel more money to develop alternative energy sources, domestic security and the Children's Health Insurance Program.\nHouse Democrats plan to reintroduce tough new ''pay-go'' budget rules as early as this Friday. Under ''pay-go,'' which governed spending measures in the 1990s but expired in 2002, new entitlement programs or new tax cuts have to be matched by comparable spending cuts or tax increases.\nPoliticians in both parties may be feeling a temporary reprieve from fiscal pressures because the budget deficit has indeed declined sharply in the last two years.\nLargely because of big back-to-back increases in tax revenue for the last two years, the deficit shrank to $248 billion in 2006 from a peak of $412 billion in 2004.\nMeasured as a share of the total economy, the approach economists view as more meaningful than the deficit size in dollars, the shortfall is 1.9 percent of the gross domestic product, modest by historical standards.\nBut many budget analysts remain highly skeptical about Mr. Bush's promise to eliminate the deficit, noting that the balanced budget would not occur until four years after he had left office.\nOne reason for the skepticism is that the government would be renewing all of Mr. Bush's tax cuts at precisely the time that the 76 million baby boomers have begun pouring into retirement and claiming government benefits from Social Security and Medicare.\nWhite House budget forecasts have also proven wildly wrong in both good years and bad, as tax revenue plunged far more than officials predicted from 2001 through 2004 and climbed faster than predicted in 2005 and 2006.\nDespite the recent jump in tax receipts, moreover, federal tax collections are still low as a share of the total economy. Spending, on the other hand, climbed sharply as a share of the economy and remains high by historical standards.\nMr. Conrad of the Budget Committee acknowledged on Tuesday that higher taxes, especially on wealthier families, would eventually have to be part of a comprehensive plan that included tough spending restraint and an overhaul of entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.\n''I believe that if Americans are told the truth they will support actions necessary to address the budget,'' he said. ''If we're going to be honest about this, it's going to require both sides' giving up some of their fundamental positions.''\nBut other Democratic lawmakers say it would be almost pointless to lead an unpopular fight over raising taxes until Republicans are willing to share some of the political pain.\nWith Mr. Bush almost certain to fight almost any effort to revisit his tax cuts, and Republicans in Congress unlikely to rebel against the president, Democrats are inclined to wait until after Mr. Bush is gone.\nTHE 110TH CONGRESS: NEWS ANALYSIS
1816275	In the Back Room and Over Drinks, Senator Clinton Plans for 2008	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The topic was the Democratic sweep in New Hampshire in November, and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton could not get enough of it.\nAt dinner in Washington recently with three allies from New Hampshire, which has the nation's first presidential primary, Mrs. Clinton was by turns probing and absorbing -- clearly informed -- a participant said.\nHow had the Democrats managed to unseat the state's two Republican members of Congress? she wanted to know. What were the key issues? And who were the new players to have emerged there in the 10 years since she last visited, and since her husband, Bill Clinton, used a strong second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary to vault his way to the Democratic nomination and the White House 15 years ago?\n''She's always been a student of government, and of how you get there,'' said Patricia McMahon, one of the dinner guests and a former Clinton White House aide who is now a state representative.\nThe meeting was one of a series of nearly nonstop political consultations that Mrs. Clinton has engaged in -- over dinner and drinks, at private offices and at her home in Washington -- since Election Day, in what her advisers say are preparations for a probable announcement that she is taking the first steps into the 2008 presidential campaign.\nMrs. Clinton, the New York Democrat, was described by participants as leaving little doubt that she planned to run, without saying so directly. Depending on her audience, she appears to be either seeking information to use in campaign strategy, pressing potential supporters to hold tight and wait for her to announce or gauging how certain issues, in particular her initial vote for the war in Iraq, may play.\nThe sessions are a subject of much discussion in Democratic circles, and they seem intended in part to counter any impression that Mrs. Clinton is surrounded by an insular circle of longtime advisers and friends who are detached from many of the grass-roots Democrats who have grown in influence since the last time a Clinton ran for president.\nAccording to participants, Mrs. Clinton has pressed to find out everything from whether Al Gore will run again (he is inclined not to, people tell her) to how much support remains for Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the party's 2004 candidate, among Democratic leaders (anemic, she has heard).\nMrs. Clinton told Democrats that she viewed her two strongest potential Democratic opponents to be Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina.\nThe participants said that she considered Mr. Obama as her biggest obstacle to the nomination, but that she believed the threat of his candidacy would diminish as voters learned how inexperienced he was in government and foreign affairs. Without mentioning Mr. Obama by name, Mrs. Clinton and her camp are asserting that experience will be a major attribute for any successful candidate during difficult times, an argument that her team will no doubt make in a stronger way against Mr. Obama if they both jump into the race.\nMrs. Clinton is holding her discussions at a time of tremendous fluidity in presidential politics. The emergence of Mr. Obama, the Democratic takeover of Congress, the continued deterioration in Iraq and the decisions by Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and former Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia not to run have made her consultations more important and the situation she faces more complex.\nAccording to participants, it is clear that Mrs. Clinton is far along in plotting a campaign and that she is honing strategy at the same time that she is making overtures to people in states that heavily influence the presidential nominating process. New Hampshire is expected to hold the first primary in January 2008, after caucuses in Iowa and Nevada.\nMrs. Clinton has gone to great lengths to try to keep these meetings private. She and her aides have strongly asked Democrats not to report what has taken place there, from what she says to what she eats, and where (she had the lamb at Ruth's Chris Steak House in Washington, the Dover sole at the Four Seasons in New York). Many people who discussed the meetings did so on the condition of anonymity, and some of her advisers pointedly refused to talk. Among the latter was Paul Begala, the Democratic consultant who worked as a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton in the 1992 presidential race and who remains close to Mrs. Clinton.\n''As I tell the boys: N.H.D.: Not. Happening. Dude,'' Mr. Begala wrote in an e-mail message in response to an interview request, ''the boys'' referring to his sons.\nStill, several Democrats were willing to share what they described as long discussions about politics and policy with a former first lady who wants to be president.\nSenator Clinton told one New Hampshire Democrat that if all things were equal, she would prefer to delay the formal start of her campaign until later this year and focus instead on notching accomplishments as a prominent member of the new Democratic majority in the Senate. At several meetings, Mrs. Clinton has wondered, with obvious exasperation, why her husband was able to delay making his announcement until October, while she is under increasing pressure to make hers earlier, participants said.\n''I recommended that she didn't need to jump in early, that I would like to see some progress in the Senate, and she said she felt the same way,'' said William Shaheen, a senior New Hampshire aide to Mr. Gore in 2000 and to Mr. Kerry in 2004.\nSome of her aides said although she would probably announce within a few weeks the creation of a presidential exploratory committee, a step that would allow her to start raising money, a formal announcement could take longer. And some of the advice she has heard has been to wait.\n''Senator Clinton was clear that she'd like to focus on the Senate,'' Mr. Shaheen said. ''But sometimes events come into it, other people start beating the drum quicker, and you can lose key people if you wait.''\nJeanne Shaheen, the former New Hampshire governor and Mr. Shaheen's wife, said that Mrs. Clinton had consulted her, as well, and that she had asked ''all the right kinds of questions.''\n''She clearly is thinking about what to do, and not taking anything for granted,'' said Mrs. Shaheen, who is now the director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard. ''She has a special relationship with the people in New Hampshire, from her years in the White House, and I think she was trying to get a sense of what a campaign would be like, if she decides to run.''\nMrs. Clinton has talked, in person or by telephone, to influential Democrats in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada, the states that will have caucuses or primaries a year from now. She has pressed Democrats to find out what campaign staffs prospective opponents like Mr. Edwards have assembled in states like Iowa. And she has asked precisely where she should go in places like Iowa and New Hampshire if, as expected, she does a round of trips there after forming an exploratory committee.\nNo detail has been too minor. Mrs. Clinton has asked Democrats from New Hampshire and Iowa about the concerns in certain regions, and even counties, dwelling on energy issues, health care, education and the war in Iraq. She has asked about the influence of independent voters (they make up the biggest voting bloc in New Hampshire and can vote in the Democratic primary there).\nMrs. Clinton has less experience with presidential politics in Iowa than in New Hampshire because in 1992, when her husband ran the first time, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa was also seeking the presidential nomination, so other candidates steered clear of the race.\nMrs. Clinton has not been to Iowa since the 2004 race.\nThe senator spent the week between Christmas and New Year's Day on vacation with her husband in the Caribbean, but her associates said Tuesday that she would return this week to working through her long call list with Democrats around the country, and holding private lunches and dinners in Washington and New York.\nThe New Hampshire Democratic Party has invited her to be a keynote speaker at a major fund-raiser this winter, and officials there say they expect her to attend, and are waiting to hear about a date. They say the fund-raiser could be anytime from late January through March.\nSome New Hampshire Democrats expressed concern that Mrs. Clinton's first dinner with political players from that state, on Dec. 9, was limited to three who were active in her husband's campaigns in the 1990s and not a broader group that reflected the vanguard of state party politics today.\nTerie T. Norelli, who became speaker of the New Hampshire House in December and the first Democratic speaker in 70 years, said she had not heard from Mrs. Clinton.\n''It'll only be tricky for her if she stops with those people,'' Ms. Norelli said in reference to the Clintons' longest-standing New Hampshire friends. ''Democratic politics has certainly changed since the 1990s, if you look at how many Democrats have been elected to the House and the two new Democrats going to Congress. It would be wise for any candidate to move on and reach out to many of the new activists that we have.''

1816277	Giuliani Leak: Attention Turns To Florida	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E0D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Mischief in presidential politics in Florida?\nPerhaps so, some circumstantial evidence suggests.\nThe mystery thus far: Advisers to Rudolph W. Giuliani say that someone stole an aide's luggage during a political trip last fall, found a 140-page strategy notebook inside and photocopied it, then returned the luggage in some manner and gave the goods to a Giuliani opponent.\nThe contents of the notebook ended up splashed across The Daily News in New York on Tuesday. Not to be outdone, The New York Post reported yesterday that political operatives believed that the theft happened on a campaign trip through Florida.\nWhile it does not prove anything per se, a spokeswoman for the governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, a Republican, confirmed yesterday that luggage from the Giuliani entourage was indeed missing during a campaign trip last fall.\n''They were traveling with us, and we did find a piece of luggage, and we just worked as quickly as possible to get it back to the owner,'' said Erin Isaac, the spokeswoman.\nMs. Isaac said she had no information about allegations by Mr. Giuliani's office that someone, somewhere, stole and photocopied the notebook; she added that the governor's office was not conducting an inquiry into those allegations.\nShe said that the piece of luggage was left on a Crist plane ''during the chaos of the campaign,'' and that nothing fishy happened with the bag when it was in their custody.\n''No copies were made. The bag was found and held until we were able to return it to the owner,'' Ms. Isaac said.\nShe said that Mr. Crist's campaign switched planes all the time last fall, and that she did not have specifics about the plane, luggage or trip involving the Giuliani contingent.\nSunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, issued a statement yesterday that underscored one certainty in this mystery: Mr. Giuliani, as a possible Republican candidate for president, cannot afford to alienate the Republican who is set to lead Florida through the 2008 balloting.\n''We have no question that whatever happened had nothing to do with Governor Crist or his staff,'' said the statement from Anthony Carbonetti, a senior political adviser to Mr. Giuliani. ''The mayor has the highest regard for Governor Crist.''
1816278	Taiwan's Bullet Trains Can't Outrun Controversy	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E0D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The sleek, bulbous-nosed new bullet trains here look like they are designed to whisk passengers across wide-open spaces. But on this congested island, they represent the start of a 180-mile-per-hour commuter train system.\nAfter a quarter century of planning and construction, the system is scheduled to open on Jan. 5. It will tie together cities and towns where 94 percent of Taiwan's population lives, offering an alternative to clogged highways and the air pollution the vehicles on them produce.\nFor some urban planners and environmentalists, the project is an example of how Asia may be able to control oil imports, curb fast-rising emissions of global-warming gases and bring a higher standard of living to enormous numbers of people in an environmentally sustainable way.\nPassengers who travel on a fully loaded train will use only a sixth of the energy they would use if they drove alone in a car and will release only one-ninth as much carbon dioxide, the main gas linked to global warming. Compared with a bus ride, the figures are half the energy and a quarter of the carbon dioxide, train system officials said.\nBut the system's enormous cost -- $15 billion, or $650 for every man, woman and child on Taiwan -- has made it a subject of dispute. And a series of commercial disputes since the project began in 1980 has produced a remarkable hodgepodge: French and German train drivers who are allowed to speak only English with Taiwanese traffic controllers while operating Japanese bullet trains on tracks originally designed by British and French engineers.\nThe system has become so complex that the leader of Taiwan's consumer movement is calling for citizens to boycott it entirely until extensive safety data is released.\n''Cherish your life, don't be a guinea pig,'' Cheng Jen-hung, the chairman of the Consumers' Foundation, said in an interview, repeating his group's slogan. With 900 passengers on a fully loaded train, he warned, ''if there is an accident, there will be very heavy casualties.''\nArthur Chiang, the vice president for administration at Taiwan High Speed Rail, said the system was completely safe. But he acknowledged that the project had been bedeviled by opposition.\n''Pandora's box has already opened and everything has come out except hope and mutual trust,'' he said during a recent test run on one of the new trains from the capital, Taipei, in the north, to the city of Taichung, in west-central Taiwan. ''We just wanted to make it simple, but we failed,'' he added. ''Politics is one of the factors.''\nUsing overhead electric lines instead of diesel locomotives, the trains will run from Taipei down through western Taiwan to Kaohsiung, the main industrial city in the south. That is a distance of 215 miles, about the same as between New York and Washington.\nThe system will start with 19 trains in each direction daily and eventually will be able to handle 88 trains daily in each direction.\nPlanning started in 1980, when Taiwan was still under martial law. The route was preliminarily picked in 1991, as Taiwan was starting on the path to become the vibrant, even tempestuous, democracy that it is today. Every large city and town along the route lobbied to have its own stop and new railway station, and a succession of governments agreed.\nThree trains a day will travel from Taipei to Kaohsiung in 90 minutes, with just one stop, in Taichung. But most of the trains will make six intermediate stops, lengthening travel time to two hours and seven minutes.\nThat is still 38 minutes faster than Amtrak's Acela Express between New York and Washington, which also has up to six intermediate stops but a lower top speed. But flights between Taipei and Kaohsiung take just 40 minutes.\nEnormous stations resembling state-of-the-art airport terminals have been built on the outskirts of each city along the route except Taipei, where the existing main rail station is being used. The new stations cannot be in most downtown areas because of the difficulty in acquiring land for tracks: the high-speed trains travel almost entirely on specially built, 60-foot-tall viaducts to avoid the need to cross roads.\nSmaller trains and buses will link the new stations to downtown.\nAlthough many urban planners see systems like this one as positive for the environment, Lee Schipper, the research director at Embarq, an environmental transport research group in Washington, said the system could eventually increase the use of energy, rather than save it, if the ease of using the trains encouraged people to move farther away from work.\nThe expectation in Taiwan is that the train system will attract a lot of users at first, notwithstanding Mr. Cheng's call for a boycott; the consumer movement here is not as big or visible as it was even 10 years ago.\nA French train driver sporting a magnificent handlebar mustache, who declined to give his name, sent Mr. Chiang's train hurtling down the tracks on the recent test run. The driver said the trains were actually simpler to operate than those in France. ''It's easier, it's all automatic,'' he said in French. But the requirement that all communications take place in English is a complication, he added. The electronic displays in the cabs of each train are also in English.\nThe Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation is training Taiwanese drivers to replace the European drivers and plans to switch the entire system to spoken Chinese and Chinese-language computer displays in about three years, Mr. Chiang said. The consortium had expected to hire experienced Japanese drivers, but the Japanese companies that made the trains were unable to persuade Japan's rail system operators to transfer any of their drivers to Taiwan.\nWhether the train system becomes a commercial success will partly depend on how many people use its somewhat inconveniently located stations, how quickly the land is developed around these stations and how much the tickets cost. The initial price for a one-way, coach ticket from Taipei to Kaohsiung will be $44, or two-thirds the price of a typical airline ticket.\nRiding the train is much like a very low-altitude flight, and very quiet. Chen Chi-cheng, a 5-year-old invited on the test run, watched with fascination as the rooftops of houses flashed past. ''It's like a plane,'' he said breathlessly.\nTAIPEI JOURNAL
1816279	Elections for 2 Council Seats Will Be on Feb. 20	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E0D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	A special election will be held on Feb. 20 to fill two City Council seats left vacant in Brooklyn and on Staten Island, the city's Board of Elections said yesterday.\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg set the date after the resignations of Yvette D. Clarke, a Brooklyn Democrat, and Andrew J. Lanza, a Staten Island Republican.\nThe date gives candidates two weeks to file petitions proclaiming their intentions with the Board of Elections. The filing deadline is midnight Jan. 16, said John Ravitz, the board's executive director.\nWinning candidates will serve for the rest of the year and will automatically be put on the September primary ballot or the November general election ballot if a primary is not held, Mr. Ravitz said.\nMs. Clarke resigned her District 40 seat after winning the Congressional seat for central Brooklyn in November. Mr. Lanza left his District 51 seat for the State Senate.\nThe City Council held its 2007 inaugural meeting yesterday and passed one piece of legislation, which requires the city to look at 300 of its highest-energy-using buildings to see if clean-burning natural gas generators can be installed to ease electricity use, especially in the summer. The mayor is expected to sign the bill.\nThe special election comes as the Bloomberg administration and the Board of Elections gird for problems in this year's elections. The state's Board of Elections has yet to certify voting machines that meet federal requirements to overhaul the system and replace aging machines.\nThe state has been under increasing pressure since the Justice Department sued it last year for failing to comply with guidelines enacted by Congress in 2002. Those guidelines were intended to spur states to modernize their systems to avoid an election debacle like the one in Florida in 2000.\nThe state is not expected to make its selections until February, and election officials say that will not give them enough time to install software, train staff members and poll workers and advise the public on how to operate the new machines. The state risks losing $20 million in federal money if a new system is not in place by the fall election.\nThe special election will be held using the old lever-operated machines, Mr. Ravitz said. Important dates and deadlines and other instructions for the special election can be found on the Board of Elections Web site at vote.nyc.ny.us/index.html.
1816280	U.S. Is Looking Into Bruno's Ties to an Investment Firm	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E0D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The federal investigation into the business activities of Joseph L. Bruno, who was re-elected majority leader of the State Senate on Wednesday, has widened to include an Albany investment firm that has had close ties to him, public records show.\nThe Daily News reported on Wednesday that federal authorities had issued a subpoena to obtain documents from McGinn, Smith & Company, an investment firm that was a client of the senator's private consulting business.\nThe company's chairman, Timothy M. McGinn, who founded the firm with David L. Smith in 1980, would not discuss the subpoena. ''We're cooperating fully with the investigation,'' Mr. McGinn said in a brief telephone interview.\nThe financial interests of Mr. Bruno and Mr. McGinn have intersected several times over the years, according to public records.\nIn 1999, Mr. Bruno reported making a profit from the sale of stock he owned in the Pointe Financial Corporation, a bank holding company in Boca Raton, Fla., where Mr. McGinn was vice chairman and an investor. That profit was reported on a disclosure form filed with the Legislative Ethics Committee, but the publicly available section does not indicate when he bought the stock or how much he made on the sale.\nAccording to records from the State Board of Elections, two campaign committees controlled by Mr. Bruno invested contributions in recent years in two companies run by Mr. McGinn: Integrated Alarm Services Group and the Capital Center Credit Corporation.\nAlthough campaigns typically leave excess cash in bank accounts, it is legal for them to invest it in stocks, bonds and other financial instruments. Campaign finance regulations do not require that committees disclose where they make such investments, but they must report any income gained from them.\nRecords show that from November 2001 to March 2003, Capital Center Credit -- an affiliate of McGinn, Smith -- paid $121,470 in ''interest or dividends'' to Mr. Bruno's committee and the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, and that from May 2003 to September 2004, Integrated Alarm paid $145,833 to the two committees.\nIntegrated Alarm, which monitors security alarms, went public in 2003. In 2004, Mr. McGinn sold much of his stake in McGinn, Smith to focus on his role as chairman and chief executive at the alarm company. He was ousted from the company in June, partly because he resisted talk of a merger. Last month, the company announced that it was being bought by another company for $84.8 million.\nThere are other ties between Mr. Bruno and McGinn, Smith. In 1997, The Village Voice reported that Mr. Bruno was a part-time consultant to the firm in 1993 and 1994.\nIn 2003, Mr. Bruno announced that he had secured $500,000 in state aid for a proposed $470 million educational, tourism and entertainment project on the Troy, N.Y., riverfront. Pieter S. VanDerzee, an executive at McGinn, Smith at the time, was one of the three main investors in that venture.\nJohn E. McArdle, a spokesman for the senator, said that Mr. Bruno's support for the project was ''absolutely and unequivocally not'' connected to any involvement by McGinn, Smith. ''Senator Bruno never provided any funds for the Harbor at Troy waterfront project because the developers who proposed it did not have the backing or expertise they originally claimed, and it became clear that the project was not feasible,'' Mr. McArdle said.
1816281	Lieberman's Party Now Has Critic as Its Chief	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E0D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut was able to beat back a fierce challenge last fall, but now his critics are joining the very party he created to win his way back to Washington for a fourth term.\nShortly after the November election, John M. Orman, a professor of politics at Fairfield University who ran briefly against Mr. Lieberman, filed paperwork with state election officials to become the chairman of the Connecticut for Lieberman party.\nIf you can't beat him, Mr. Orman reasoned, join his party to argue with him.\nAnd this week, the secretary of state's office said that was just fine.\nMr. Lieberman created the party line last summer when it became clear he might lose the Democratic primary to Ned Lamont. By creating a minor party, Mr. Lieberman was assured a higher ballot position than if he had run as an individual, but neither he nor his supporters said that they planned to keep the party active or join it themselves. Instead, Mr. Lieberman pledged to remain a Democrat if re-elected.\nAs it turned out, Mr. Lieberman, who lost the primary but won the general election handily, later said that his party identification was not that simple, and asked to be called an ''Independent Democrat'' -- something that agitated his already vocal band of opponents.\n''It was a joke,'' Mr. Orman said of Mr. Lieberman's political party. ''There was a mockery of the system. I expected the secretary of state to say this was a mockery. But none of that happened.''\nMr. Orman is the lone member of the party. But after an article about his move appeared in The Stamford Advocate on Wednesday, he said he received dozens of calls and e-mail messages from people asking to join. Under the rules, Mr. Orman said, any critic of Mr. Lieberman, or even someone who shares Mr. Lieberman's last name would be eligible.\nUnder state law, control of the party can be challenged in court. But Mr. Lieberman, who was at the Capitol on Wednesday for the inauguration of Gov. M. Jodi Rell, said he had no plans to take legal action.\n''We haven't thought about the party,'' he said. ''That party won't have anything to do until six years from now.''\nNot if Mr. Orman has his way. He plans to hold regular meetings to critique Mr. Lieberman. And if the past is any guide, such meetings are not likely to be quiet affairs.
1816282	Pomp and Promises as Rell Begins Full Term	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE0D91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Casting her first full term as governor as a chance to guide the state through a ''crossroads of needed economic, social, cultural and educational change,'' M. Jodi Rell was sworn in as Connecticut's 87th governor on Wednesday, promising to ''lead'' and ''inspire.''\nIn her eight-minute speech, Mrs. Rell, a Republican who was elected in a landslide victory last fall, promised to work with Democrats who control the State Legislature to address a litany of issues including education reform, soaring property taxes and energy prices, and costly health care.\nBut while she offered an optimistic assessment of the future, Mrs. Rell did not say how she planned to address those problems.\n''As your governor, I will forcefully lend my voice, freely share my vision, and help to shape a Connecticut that is yet to be,'' said Mrs. Rell, 60. ''I will guard the public's trust and continue to do honor to public service.''\nMrs. Rell assumed the governor's office two and half years ago after John G. Rowland resigned amid a federal corruption investigation and an impeachment inquiry. At the time, Mrs. Rell took her oath in a somber ceremony in which she promised to restore trust.\nThe governor's message was much the same on Wednesday, although with much more pomp. Before taking the oath of office in the atrium of the Legislative Office Building, Mrs. Rell marched in a parade with her husband, Lou, their son, Michael, and their daughter, Meredith. They moved through the streets surrounding the Capitol as dozens of state workers and supporters cheered her on.\n''You'll do anything to get out of work,'' Mrs. Rell said.\nThe parade, with a 19-gun salute and marching bands, and a black-tie ball Wednesday evening, were the first elaborate inauguration events held here in nearly a decade. But Ms. Rell broke from tradition by not addressing state lawmakers in a joint session on their first day of the legislative calendar.\nHer aides indicated that she would present legislators with more concrete plans when she introduced her budget next month. The Democrats hold a veto-proof majority in both legislative chambers and have indicated that they will push for instituting universal health care and reducing energy costs, which are among the highest in the nation.\nWhile Ms. Rell said that the state would have to address such problems, she hinted that she would probably support small steps rather than dramatic proposals.\n''There is a great yearning in our state -- a yearning for change, for improvement and also for greater equality,'' she said. ''And there is also a yearning for stability, for preserving the history, the tradition and the uniqueness of Connecticut-- a yearning, a conflict between change and constancy.''\nIn a day marked largely by ceremony rather than debates over policy, James A. Amann, the House speaker, said that Ms. Rell had delivered a message most residents were eager to hear.\n''I actually liked the speech,'' said Mr. Amann, a Democrat. ''She tried to tell people that the sun is rising on Connecticut, not setting. People want to hear that.''
1816283	Mexican U.N. Insider Gets Manager's Post	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01EFD91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Ban Ki-moon, on his second day as secretary general, appointed a high-level United Nations insider, Alicia Bárcena Ibarra, to the top management post, a signal that he does not plan aggressive reforms in the much-criticized bureaucracy.\nMs. Bárcena, 54, is a career diplomat from Mexico who served for most of last year as the chief of staff for Kofi Annan, Mr. Ban's predecessor. Before that, since July 2003, Ms. Bárcena had been the deputy executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, a United Nations development agency based in Chile.\nUnited Nations diplomats pointed out that Ms. Bárcena, although a well-regarded diplomat, had little of the front-line administrative experience needed to run the unwieldy United Nations system, which employs 16,500 people worldwide.\nHer appointment marked the first time since 1992 that her position, under secretary general for management, has not been held by an American. In years past, the United States government has battled for the position, but this time Washington is lobbying instead for the top policy-making job, under secretary general for political affairs.\nSeveral diplomats said the choice of Ms. Bárcena cast doubt on statements Mr. Ban made on Tuesday, when he said in a meeting with United Nations staff members that he wanted to overhaul ''the working culture'' of the organization.\n''It's a missed opportunity in terms of having a clean break from the Kofi Annan era,'' said one Security Council diplomat. ''It would have made sense if she had immense financial and management experience. But to the contrary, she doesn't.''\nBut the announcement cited Ms. Bárcena's broad knowledge of the sprawling United Nations organization. She has also worked closely with Mr. Ban during the transition from Mr. Annan's leadership, and Mr. Ban has said he will appoint more women to senior positions.\n''He has set his agenda, and I am sure that Ms. Bárcena agrees with that agenda,'' said Michèle Montas, Mr. Ban's spokeswoman.\nThe management post had been filled since June 2005 by Christopher B. Burnham, a former Marine Corps reserve colonel and investment banker. Under his tenure, the United Nations adopted new protections for whistleblowers, formed an ethics office, updated its financial disclosure policies and reorganized the procurement department, which has been the target of several criminal fraud indictments. Mr. Burnham stepped down in November.\nIn the meeting Tuesday with Mr. Ban, Stephen Kisambira, the president of the staff members' union, said the United Nations needed ''a fundamental change in the mindset of senior management'' from a current approach that he said was based on ''dominance, disregard and fear.''\nMr. Ban also appointed Sir John Holmes, the British ambassador to France, as under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and coordinator of emergency relief.
1816284	Empty Seat on Giants' Bus to Philadelphia	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800EFD91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Roy Posner wasn't on the Giants' masthead, but he was their unofficial financial consultant. When Bob Tisch bought 50 percent of the Giants early in 1991, Posner, who was Tisch's chief financial officer at the Loews Corporation from 1973 to 1997, helped negotiate the numbers. When Tisch completed his ownership agreement with Wellington Mara, Posner checked the commas.\n''Roy became part of the family,'' John Mara, the Giants' president, said.\nThe Giants were not Posner's original pro football family. Growing up in Chicago, he had been a lifelong Bears fan, going back to their famous 1940 team that routed the Redskins, 73-0, for the N.F.L. championship. He remembered his father taking him to Bears games on Sunday afternoons and to Blackhawks games those evenings. Until this year, he had Bears season tickets.\nBut after Tisch became the Giants' co-owner, Posner was always around to do whatever anybody in the Giants family asked him to do.\nIn sports, there are always good people like this around a team, people in the background, people whom fans have no reason to know.\nSturdy and white-haired, Posner stood on the sideline during games with a towel around his neck. On his visits to the front office, he answered questions from Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general manager, about the salary cap or a player's contract. For years, Accorsi preferred to stay in his hotel room the night before a road game, but Posner persuaded him to join him for dinner.\nWhen Giants players gathered for an away game, Posner handed out the envelopes with their per diem meal money.\nWhen the game officials knocked on the Giants' locker room door for a random inspection of offensive linemen's jerseys for slippery substances that could foil a pass rusher, Posner would gather the designated linemen. Some of the offensive linemen didn't even know his last name. Roy was always enough.\n''Roy always had a smile,'' guard Rich Seubert said.\nAfter Saturday night's 34-28 victory over the Redskins, his smile was wider than ever. As he waited outside FedEx Field next to one of the four buses that would take the Giants to the New Carrollton, Md., station for their chartered train home, he was assuring John Mara that the Giants would surely qualify for Super Bowl XLI when they were struck by lemons thrown by disgruntled Redskins fans. The lemons didn't hurt, but the juice splattered them.\n''There's nothing more gratifying than having the opposing team's fans throwing things at you,'' Mara told him, ''but we better get inside the bus.''\nWith a laugh, Posner, 73, hurried into his usual seat, in the front row on the right, across the aisle from Accorsi, who was sitting behind the driver. With lemons splattering against the windows, the Giants' caravan soon moved out of the parking lot for the short trip to the station, where the players, coaches and front-office people gathered on a platform.\nInstead of taking the escalator to the platform, Posner, carrying two bags, used the elevator. He was standing with the others on the platform when he collapsed.\nHe was quickly surrounded by Ronnie Barnes, the Giants' chief trainer, and his assistant, Byron Hansen (who had rushed to him with a defibrillator), along with Mara, Accorsi, team doctors, coaches, several players and front-office people.\n''You've got to fight, Roy,'' center Shaun O'Hara could be heard telling him. ''You've got to fight.''\nMoments later, Posner, revived, appeared to have won his fight, and when an ambulance arrived, Hansen accompanied him to nearby Prince George's Hospital Center as the Giants' train rumbled north.\n''Half an hour later,'' Accorsi said, ''we heard that Roy was talking about the game and about Tiki Barber's 234 yards.''\nAnother call to Barnes soon silenced the Giants' train ride. Roy Posner had died of cardiac arrest.\nWhen the train arrived in Newark about 3:30 a.m., most of the Giants' family quietly boarded buses to Giants Stadium, where their cars had been parked and where Roy Posner had parked his car after driving from his home in Hawthorne, N.J. He is survived by two daughters and four grandchildren.\n''For decades, Roy Posner was a trusted adviser, co-worker and dear friend of my late father, Bob,'' said Jonathan Tisch, Giants treasurer and co-chairman of Loews. ''Roy's numerous contributions helped create the Loews Corporation of today, and his advice and counsel to senior management of the Giants has been invaluable.''\nOn Saturday, four buses will take the Giants down the New Jersey Turnpike for Sunday's playoff game in Philadelphia.\n''But on the front-office bus,'' Ernie Accorsi said, ''nobody will be sitting there in Roy's seat in the front row on the right.''\nSPORTS OF THE TIMES
1816285	Lack of Rules on Protective Gear Brings Suit Against Labor Dept.	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EED91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Food and Commercial Workers sued the Department of Labor yesterday, asserting that it broke the law by failing to issue regulations requiring employers to pay for protective equipment for their workers.\nThe two labor organizations said it was wrong for the Labor Department to require employers to provide protective equipment like helmets, face shields and gloves, while often letting employers charge workers for that equipment.\nThe groups complained that the Labor Department under President Bush had not issued final rules based on those the Clinton Labor Department proposed in 1999. Those proposals would have required companies to pay for all employee protective equipment required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department.\nIn an unusual move, the A.F.L.-C.I.O and the food workers' union asked the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to order Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao to issue final rules.\nThe A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney, said, ''The Bush administration's failure to implement even this most basic safety rule spotlights how it has turned its back on workers in this country.''\nDavid James, a Labor Department spokesman, said officials were studying the lawsuit. He said the case ''deals with complicated issues that will affect different employers and employees in different ways.''\nMr. James said the department had reason to hesitate to turn the 1999 proposal into a final, enforceable rule. ''The department takes pride in its excellent safety and enforcement records,'' he said. ''But on this issue, a number of public comments we received take issue with the factual assumptions'' in the rule proposed in 1999.\nThe lawsuit notes that by OSHA's own estimates 400,000 workers have been injured and 50 have died because of the absence of a rule.\nA.F.L.-C.I.O. officials said the Labor Department was violating laws on administrative procedures and occupational safety by failing to issue final rules.\nIn 2004, Richard E. Fairfax, OSHA's director for enforcement, wrote a letter to a corporate safety director saying that while federal regulations required employers to provide personal protective equipment to ensure its use, ''OSHA does not view this section as imposing an enforceable obligation on employers to pay for the P.P.E.,'' a reference to such equipment.\nPeg Seminario, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s director of occupational safety and health, said that some meat and poultry companies required employees to pay for gloves and that some welding companies required them to pay for visors even though federal rules said employers must provide them.She said that 20 million workers used required protective equipment and that most employers did pay for it.\nJoseph Hansen, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers said, ''Nothing is standing in the way of OSHA issuing a final rule to protect worker safety and health except the will to do so.''

Graber, originally charged with capital murder, to be convicted of aggravated assault and to receive a nine-month prison sentence in exchange for his testifying against three other members of his squad, the lawyers said.\nThe three other soldiers, members of the same company as Specialist Graber in the division's Third Brigade, still face courts-martial on premeditated-murder charges, making them eligible for the death penalty or, barring that, life in prison. Army prosecutors have accused them of carrying out an impromptu plan, following a raid on a marshy island northwest of Baghdad, to kill the three Iraqis after cutting off their plastic handcuffs and forcing them to run, still blindfolded, from the squalid hut where they had been discovered.\nThe two soldiers accused of firing on the men as they fled -- Specialist William B. Hunsaker and Pfc. Corey R. Clagett -- have said they shot in self-defense after the three broke free from the thin ''zip-tie'' handcuffs and attacked them.\nA third soldier, Staff Sgt. Raymond L. Girouard, the squad's ranking member, is accused of devising the plan to kill the men, then punching Private Clagett and cutting Specialist Hunsaker to give the appearance that they had been attacked.\nNone of these three defendants have entered a formal pea.\nThe guilty plea by Specialist Graber, to be entered before an Army judge at Fort Campbell, Ky., and his testimony against the other soldiers will make gaining their acquittal far more difficult than it would have been had all four kept a unified legal front, lawyers for the three others said.\n''It changes the complexion of the entire case and makes the case much stronger against Clagett, Hunsaker and Girouard,'' said Paul Bergrin, a lawyer for Private Clagett who said he had not expected Specialist Graber to get ''such an outstanding deal.''\n''It gives the government's case credibility and corroboration where they didn't have it before,'' Mr. Bergrin added. ''It requires us to rethink our strategy.''\nSpecialist Graber's two military lawyers, Capt. Shaun Lister and Capt. Will Suddeth, did not reply to e-mailed requests for comment or phone messages left with military officials at Fort Hood, Tex., where both are based. Their client's willingness to testify for the prosecution, though, was bitter news to the three other defendants.\nMichael Waddington, a lawyer for Specialist Hunsaker, said Specialist Graber's plea arrangement felt like a betrayal, ''especially when we've been disclosing our strategy'' to his lawyers for months. Specialist Graber's legal team had joined with Mr. Waddington, Mr. Bergrin and Capt. Ted Miller, a lawyer for Sergeant Girouard, in a collaborative pact known as a joint defense agreement, which lawyers often create if their clients face similar charges in the same incident.\nDefense lawyers said Specialist Graber's plea was not particularly surprising, given the disparity between the evidence against him and the charges he had faced.\nAccording to the evidence, Specialist Graber made a last-second decision to shoot the dying man after a squad medic declared him beyond help and, according to sworn statements from soldiers not charged in the case, after Sergeant Girouard said, ''Put him out of his misery.''\nBut Army prosecutors nonetheless charged Specialist Graber, 21, with premeditated murder, creating an enormous incentive, defense lawyers for the three other soldiers said, for him to plead guilty to a lesser charge that more closely fit the crime.\nThe first court-martial in the case will be Private Clagett's, scheduled to begin Jan. 15 at Fort Campbell, Mr. Bergrin said. Two other soldiers, Sgt. Leonel Lemus and Pfc. Bradley Mason, are expected to testify for the prosecution that they heard Sergeant Girouard conceive a plan to free the Iraqi men from their handcuffs and have Private Clagett and Specialist Hunsaker kill them.\nBut Mr. Bergrin said he would call a powerful witness of his own: Col. Michael Steele, the brigade commander, who, according to several soldiers' sworn testimony, told some soldiers to ''kill all military-age males'' they encountered during the raid, on May 9.\nColonel Steele's lawyer, Lt. Col. Raymond A. Jackson, said on Wednesday that Colonel Steele had never given such an order, a denial putting him at odds with several soldiers under his command.\nThe Army has granted Colonel Steele immunity to testify, Mr. Bergrin said, and once on the stand and under oath, ''he's going to have to tell the truth.''\nCorrection: January 5, 2007, Friday An article yesterday about a guilty plea by Army Specialist Juston R. Graber to a reduced charge of mercy killing in connection with the deaths of three Iraqi men misstated the original charge against him and the maximum punishment three other soldiers could receive if convicted. Specialist Graber was charged with noncapital murder, not capital murder. The three other soldiers scheduled for courts-martial face life in prison -- not the death penalty -- if convicted.

Several students reported hearing multiple gunshots and seeing blood on hallway lockers as the victim slumped to the floor. Many students and teachers took cover beneath tables.\nThe victim was identified by the Pierce County medical examiner as Samnang Kok, 17. The police did not identify the suspect but said he was 18 and had no prior record. They said he appeared to single out his victim and did not fire shots at anyone else. Pierce County jail records showed that Douglas S. Chanthabouly, 18, was booked for investigation of first-degree murder, and the local news media identified him as the suspect. Detectives were interviewing the suspect to try to determine a motive, and the police said the shooting did not appear to be gang related.\n''The last word we got from the guys doing the investigation was they had no idea,'' said Mark Fulghum, a spokesman for the Tacoma Police Department.\nChief Don Ramsdell said: ''Not too far from here, they were able to locate the subject just walking down the street. He was taken into custody without incident. There was a weapon recovered, unknown if that was the actual weapon.''\nFoss High School, which has about 1,700 students, does not have metal detectors but does employ private security guards, said Chris Taylor, a police detective.School was canceled after the shooting.
1816288	Who Is That Wearing That Milk Mustache?	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402EED91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	BRAND mascots and other types of brand ambassadors -- meant to bring a brand to life in tangible form -- are everywhere these days, as marketers look for new ways to spread their messages across a variety of media.\nMarketers say the characters, whether symbolic or actual warm bodies, translate especially well to the Web, where video and audio are increasingly being used to build brands. They are part of what is known as experiential marketing, which seeks to translate a product or brand into a three-dimensional form to increase its appeal to potential buyers.\nSuch branding is a ''definite trend right now,'' said Tracy Ryan, associate professor of advertising research at Virginia Commonwealth University. ''They can more effectively communicate the same cues'' for a brand ''in multiple places. It's their very transportability that is key.''\nMarketers like Procter & Gamble and Diageo say brand ambassadors give their marketing programs greater flexibility, because they can use the same image on television, in print or online. P.& G. posts images of its flesh-and-blood Mr. Clean on a Web site (mrclean.com), while Diageo goes even further, posting video and audio of its Tanqueray gin ambassador, Tony Sinclair, an affable 30-something with an English accent, onTanqueray.com.\nBrand ambassadors can also have provocative personality elements that ''surprise and delight viewers,'' as Burger King says of its quirky King, who appears on BKGamer.com. That is important because advertisers encourage consumers to spread online ads by forwarding them to other consumers -- and a dull ad has little chance of being forwarded.\nDiageo has inbued Tony Sinclair with the personality of an urbane, hip smooth-talker. LG Mobile signed the teenage singer Rihanna, whose songs appeal to the young audience it is aiming for.\nLast month, Burger King's King, plastic though he may be, joined legions of personalities who have appeared in ''milk mustache'' ads. And over at Procter & Gamble, a real-life, hunky Mr. Clean took his magic to the New Orleans Superdome, where he led a group of volunteers in cleaning up after Hurricane Katrina.\nA spokesman for P.& G., Glenn Williams, said Mr. Clean ''embodies the spirit of the brand -- a magical helper who appears when he's most needed.'' The company posted on YouTube the video clips of a look-alike contest held at the Mall of America, though they have generated only about 700 views so far.\nThe Mr. Clean character has also appeared on ''Cold Pizza'' on the ESPN2 cable network, as well as at many consumer marketing events.\nBurger King's monarch appeared last year in a commercial that ran during Super Bowl XL in February, as well as in the mustache print ad for the Milk Processor Education Program, which appeared in magazines like Rolling Stone and People en Español. A series of video games for the Microsoft Xbox 360 system, sponsored by Burger King, featured the character, too; they have become something of cult hits on gaming blogs. More than 300 people auditioned for the role of Tony Sinclair. Rodney Mason, a dancer and actor, has personified the character since 2005 in a campaign created to bridge the gap between a previous Tanqueray brand ambassador, a venerable gentleman called Mr. Jenkins, and today's more youthful audience.\n''Old public school,'' meaning English private school, is how British-born Tim Mellors, vice chairman and chief creative officer at the Tanqueray agency, Grey Worldwide, described the former brand ambassador. ''There's a tinge of that in Tony,'' Mr. Mellors said, adding, ''He's the new cut on the gentleman's gentleman.''\nDiageo is preparing a nine-minute Web movie for national introduction in March. The film, ''Globe Probe,'' takes Mr. Sinclair and an oddball cast of characters to India, where they search for the lime groves of Rangpur to help make a new Diageo offering, Tanqueray Rangpur, which ''goes with everything,'' as the campaign will proclaim.\nStarwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide is sifting through more than 5,000 applications to find a new brand ambassador, the ''chief beer officer,'' for its Four Points lodging chain.\n''My favorite so far is the one that said: 'I've been a C.E.O., a C.F.O., and a C.O.O. I'd like to be a C.B.O.,' '' said a Starwood spokeswoman, Nadeen Ayala. The beer officer will join the ''Best Brew'' program at Four Points, part of its larger ''Comfort isn't complicated'' campaign. The ''C.B.O.'' will teach guests about beer and food pairing while encouraging them to try new menu items. Shepardson Stern & Kaminsky in New York developed the campaign to hire the beer officer, which included postings on Monster.com and HotJobs.com.\nGlenfiddich Scotch whiskey, for its events, uses a mix of aficionados and a brand ambassador named Brock Savage, who represents a suave and sophisticated middle-age man. In print, online (brocksavage.com) and on TV, the character demonstrates larger-than-life exploits, like how he invented the string bikini.\nA 30-second spot by Merkley and Partners in New York, using an actor who portrays Brock Savage, began appearing last month on the History Channel. William Grant & Sons, the British maker of Glenfiddich, also plays host to tasting events in restaurants and homes, where its brand ambassadors extol the virtues of Glenfiddich.\nAs successful as the tactic can be, not every brand ambassador lives forever. Last year, two were retired.\nOne was Jeeves of AskJeeves.com, the search engine Web site. The decidedly English butler was the search engine's symbol for a decade before disappearing, or, as the renamed Ask.com site puts it, ''retiring in style.'' As Web searchers became used to getting answers in 0.06 seconds or less from Google, research found that consumers regarded this symbol as more ''stodgy'' than ''trustworthy.''\nAnd Helluva Good, which makes dairy products, got rid of its Father Time character. New packaging will feature what the company calls ''fresh, vibrant colors'' that will connect more closely with consumers. Father Time, who looked all of his 84 years, was spent.\nUsing real-life brand ambassadors ''is an expensive strategy,'' said Michael R. Solomon, visiting professor of marketing at St. Joseph's University and author of ''Conquering Consumerspace: Marketing Strategies for a Branded World.''\n''You want someone who is credible and attractive in a kind of aspirational way,'' Mr. Solomon said. ''That person rubs off on or contaminates the object it's linked to. But it can be risky.''\nStill, he added, ''a message needs to come from somewhere. Where it comes from and how it's interpreted vary widely, even if it's the same message. That's the power of a source.''\nADVERTISING

Sprint Nextel spends an estimated $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion each year on advertising.\nSince Sprint acquired Nextel in 2005, the merged company has been using the former Nextel agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York, for consumer ads and the former Sprint agency, Publicis & Hal Riney in San Francisco, for business-to-business ads. Both agencies are ''world class,'' said a Sprint Nextel spokeswoman, Mary Nell Westbrook, ''but it's a tough space we operate in, with a lot of competition, and we're looking for fresh approaches and new thinking.''\nMs. Westbrook said that Sprint Nextel had not decided whether to ask the incumbents to take part in the review, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of March. The goal is to use a single creative agency, she added, just as last March the company consolidated its media account, once divided between MindShare and Starcom, at MindShare.\nTBWA/Chiat/Day is part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group. Riney is part of the Publicis Groupe, as is Starcom; MindShare is part of the WPP Group.\nADDENDA
1816290	2 Top Hollywood Agents Move to a Rival Firm	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CEED91730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Two leading Hollywood agents with top-ranked writer and director clients in movies and television joined the Endeavor talent agency on Wednesday, after many years at the rival International Creative Management.\nThe announcement ignited a Hollywood-style scramble over prestigious filmmakers and television producers, as each agency strove to claim -- or retain -- the agents' star clients. And it placed an obstacle in the path of ICM, which has been pursuing an expansion strategy, notably with its acquisition last year of the television agency Broder Webb Chervin Silbermann.\nRobert Newman, the longtime film agent, and Matt Solo, who recently left his position as head of ICM's television literary department, both were made partners at Endeavor. They join 19 other partners, including Ariel Emanuel, Rick Rosen and Tom Strickler; those three left ICM 12 years ago to found Endeavor.\nIn an atmosphere of tension over declining star salaries and studio pressure, Endeavor has had a relatively successful year, with its star client Sacha Baron Cohen and his box-office smash mockumentary ''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.'' The agency's financing department helped to piece the budget together for this year's critical darling ''Babel,'' written and directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, also an Endeavor client.\nRobert Newman is one of the movie industry's best-known agents for filmmakers, having helped navigate a number of successful careers in both studio and art-house films. Clients have included Robert Rodriguez (''Spy Kids,'' ''Sin City''), Guillermo Del Toro (''Hellboy,'' ''Pan's Labyrinth'') and Baz Luhrmann (''Moulin Rouge!''), all of whom Mr. Newman said would follow him to Endeavor.\nLeaving ICM after 17 years ''is the hardest decision I've made in my life,'' Mr. Newman said on Wednesday. ''They gave me my start in the business. I'm honored to be asked to join Endeavor, and do that with confidence that they have the greatest resources and opportunities.''\nMr. Solo had been at ICM since 1996, until the agency chose not to renew his contract in December, largely because the Broder merger had swelled ICM's ranks by 58 employees. His client list included some of television's most successful executive producers, including David Shore, the creator of ''House''; Shawn Ryan, who created ''The Shield''; and Mark Wilding, the co-executive producer of ''Grey's Anatomy.'' ICM said Mr. Shore would remain at that agency.
1816291	Indications of a Slowdown In Sex Entertainment Trade	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E7D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The sex-related entertainment industry's leading performers, owners and fans gather in Las Vegas for three conferences starting next week amid indications that pornography's robust growth since it came out from behind the counter in the 1970s is slowing.\nThe sex-related entertainment business grew in 2006 by just 2.4 percent, roughly the rate of inflation, to just under $13 billion, according to Paul Fishbein, president of the AVN Media Network, which publishes five trade magazines and runs industry conferences.\nJerry Ropelato, an opponent of the industry who owns the Web site TopTenReviews.com, gave a slightly smaller estimate of the size of the business, about $12 billion.\n''The porn industry is still growing,'' Mr. Ropelato said, ''but just not at the growth rates they experienced in the past.''\nMr. Fishbein's estimates indicate that for every dollar Americans spent buying tickets to Hollywood movies last year, they spent about 90 cents viewing sex movies in various formats.\nThe slowdown may be just the latest example of how the Internet is shaking up well-established industries.\nBecause most of the industry is privately owned, accurate numbers are hard to come by. But in one part of the industry where there is independent reporting of sales -- sex movies sold over cable -- there are indications of a slowdown.\nJupiterKagan Inc., a media and technology market research company, said it expected that sex movies sold either as pay-per-view or on-demand would grow over the next decade at only half the pace of overall paid-for programming on cable.\nGeorge Niesen, managing editor of Kagan Research in Monterey, Calif., said that $1.6 billion was spent on cable pay-per-view, video-on-demand and similar services in 2006, with $515 million, or roughly a third of that, going to sex-related entertainment.\nOver the next 10 years, Kagan Research projects, overall paid-for programming on cable will grow at 12.9 percent a year, while the sex-related segment's growth will be half that, at 6.4 percent.\nRevenues appear to be growing in the dance club business. The industry's one publicly traded concern, Rick's Cabaret, which runs dance clubs in seven cities, said same-store sales in its fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 were up 25.1 percent over the previous year.\nThe idea that revenue growth has slowed for the sex-related entertainment industry was disputed by Steven Hirsch, one of three owners of the Vivid Entertainment Group, a major producer of both soft- and hard-core movies. He and other industry executives said the ways that Americans get pornography are changing, with sales of videos and magazines in decline, while sex-related entertainment over cable television and Internet streaming is growing quickly.\n''Right now, DVD is going down faster than video-on-demand is ramping up; it is just a lag in technologies,'' Mr. Hirsch said, not a fundamental easing in demand.\nHe said he did not believe that the aging of the American population had affected sales.\nThe Census Bureau estimates that the average age of Americans last year was 36, up from 30 in 1980, when the industry was growing rapidly in the wake of favorable Supreme Court decisions, fewer police raids and easy access to movies through the technology of videocassettes, which were new then.\nMr. Fishbein and others said ''the one area of huge growth'' was hard-core movies featuring women in their 30s into their 70s, a trend that has brought new work for some of the industry's stars.\n''The flashpoint for this in our culture was the teen movie 'American Pie,' where there is a famous sequence involving one of the kids and his friend's mother,'' Mr. Fishbein said.\nMr. Fishbein and others also said that there was big growth in sales of sex toys to women.\nOutside the United States, the fastest growth is in sex videos and images sent to cellphone viewing screens, Mr. Fishbein and others said.\nNone of the American cellphone companies cooperate with the industry, which he said limited the market because consumers must use complicated technology to work around the cellphone networks.\nMr. Fishbein estimated domestic revenue from these cellphone sales at just $39 million.\nMr. Hirsch, the co-owner of Vivid, said such sales via cellphones in Europe were a growth center. He said he hoped that technological changes within a few years would prompt big sales in the United States, even if the cellphone companies did not cooperate.
1816292	Putting It All Together	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E7D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	WILLIAM D. WATKINS has seven terabytes of data storage tucked into a cabinet in the media room of his beach home in Aptos, Calif. That is not a big thing for Mr. Watkins, the chief executive of Seagate, which makes hard disk drives. But it is enough space to hold 600,000 songs, 584,000 photographs and 1,000 hours of TV shows.\nAll of that material can be displayed on the giant flat-panel TV spread across one wall in the media room and distributed to the six TVs and numerous speakers throughout the house.\nCall it tech envy, but I wondered if I could set up a system on a wireless home network so my own photos, videos and movies could be viewed from any TV in the house, and an entire collection of music could be summoned from any stereo. Could I do it with equipment available at a big chain like Best Buy or Circuit City?\n''The answer to that is easy: no,'' said Dan Sokol, a technology analyst with the Envisioneering Group, electronic engineering consultants in Seaford, N.Y. The problem, according to Mr. Sokol, is that there are dozens of pieces of incompatible electronic equipment involved in this kind of project.\nI refused to take Mr. Sokol's ''no'' for an answer -- and set out to build a home media network for less than $1,000. I understood there would be plenty of hurdles. Devices coming out of the world of information technology, like PCs and networking equipment, are just beginning to communicate with the devices that come out of the world of home electronics, like TVs and stereos.\nBoth industries have been working out standards through an alphabet soup of trade associations. They are hoping that all of those devices, and cellphones, printers and digital cameras, will start making sense to each other this year. Best Buy just started selling a whole system in a box that will handle entertainment and control your thermostats and lights for $15,000.\nDevice manufacturers are convinced that consumers will want interconnectivity. Parks Associates, a technology industry consulting firm, estimates that by 2010, some 30 million American homes will have a home entertainment network. (Right now only about half of the 43 million American homes with broadband Internet connections even have a home network, so this seems like an optimistic projection.)\n''Connected entertainment is near and dear to our heart,'' said Jan-Luc Blakborn, director of digital entertainment at Hewlett-Packard. ''We clearly see connected entertainment as an area where we can grow. It is starting to happen.''\nAt present I can buy a Sonos or Squeezebox device to play music throughout the house -- but those can only handle music. Another device, the Slingbox, can send TV programs to a PC anywhere in the world over the Internet. But I do not want to watch TV on a 15-inch notebook screen when I can watch it on a 42-inch TV.\nThen there is TiVo. It had the potential to become the leading home entertainment hub. A free download of TiVo Desktop software to a PC allows video from your TiVo to be watched anywhere and anytime on that PC. If you have a second TV, any program recorded on one TiVo box can stream effortlessly to any other TiVo elsewhere in the house.\nBut this is really an example of a lost opportunity. TiVo stores video in a proprietary digital format that prevents it from being viewed on non-TiVo devices, and the files are not recognized by other hardware, which is the problem that led Mr. Sokol to declare that my efforts would be futile.\nJames Denney, vice president for product marketing at TiVo, said the company had not set out to be the center of everything. ''Our approach is that there isn't one hub in the house,'' he said. ''Our role is a display device near the TV.''\nTiVo also does nothing for my collection of DVDs. It is difficult to watch a movie on DVD over a home network without first copying it to a hard drive. Software for doing this is widely available, but it is illegal to bypass the copy protection on a DVD, even one that you own. Systems for sending copy-protected video around the house are still largely works in progress.\nAnother problem I encountered was a lack of advice. Few of the devices needed to assemble my network are even advertised by retailers or manufacturers. Sony, for instance, has a number of devices under the LocationFree name that can be used to move TV shows to a PlayStation Portable game machine or a small TV monitor outdoors, but it seems to be keeping this a secret. Hewlett-Packard is selling what it calls the MediaSmart TV, a 37-inch L.C.D. set that locates your wireless home network and pulls in content. It is a nice product, but it will not work for this project; it costs $2,000.\nTo build a homemade networked entertainment system, I needed a network, of course. Older wireless routers using the 802.11b standard will move video data so slowly that it will be nearly unwatchable. So the wireless router has to be upgraded to 802.11g or the even newer 802.11n standard.\nHere is where this project started getting expensive. Wireless devices anywhere on the network that are still using the older technology will slow the whole network. I have to upgrade them, too, for about $50 each.\nMusic, movies and photos can be stored on the hard drive of any computer connected to the network. But because TV shows or movies can fill up a PC's hard drive much faster than photos or music files do, it can make sense to centralize everything on an always-available external hard drive.\n''The way I view it, being a nerd, the storage device is as important as the media center,'' said Mike Scott, technical media manager at D-Link, a maker of home networking equipment.\nThere are now drives on the market that can hold as much as a terabyte, enough space to hold about 90 hours of high-definition TV. That much storage will cost a bit more than $500, but prices keep falling.\nI decided to use a kind of external hard drive known as a network-attached storage device. Although they cost about $100 more than regular drives, they come with software that will organize files and help all the devices on the network find the drive. The Maxtor Shared Storage II drive that I chose, which holds 1 terabyte and costs about $680, was up and running in less than 10 minutes.\nOne alternative is buy a $100 device called a network storage link that is plugged in between a regular external drive and the router. That offers more flexibility if I buy a lower-capacity drive that needs to be upgraded later.\nThe next step is attaching a media adapter to a TV or a stereo to pick up the programming from the network. D-Link sells one called the MediaLounge Media Player for less than $300. (A fancier model just hit the market for $600.) This is essentially a DVD player with a built-in wireless adapter that enables it to locate photos, movies and music on the network's hard drives. A similar device from D-Link, which costs about $180, can connect to any stereo receiver so that music files are always accessible. The drawback is that I needed one of these adapters for every TV and stereo.\nThe home entertainment network that I jury-rigged wasn't nearly as slick as Mr. Watkins's setup. But then it only cost me about $850, not including the cost of my existing computers and TV. I spent more time moving music and video files to the hard drive than I spent actually setting it up. Once the content was there, I could do exactly what I wanted to do: view whatever I wanted, wherever I wanted.\nIf all of this sounds like too much effort, you can always wait. Almost every consumer electronics company is set to announce its answer to home entertainment connectivity at the Consumer Electronics Show next week. As with all consumer electronics, the devices coming out next year will do more for less. I can only hope they will be just a little bit easier to put together.\nBASICS
1816293	Iraq Defends Hanging, But Holds Hussein Guard	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E7D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Iraqi prime minister's office on Wednesday mounted its first public defense of the way the government carried out the execution of Saddam Hussein, and said that Iraqi authorities had detained a guard who they believed was involved in recording the moment in a macabre and unauthorized video that has generated revulsion around the world.\nIraqi officials, in their effort to dampen the video's impact, tried to challenge the impression it conveyed that Mr. Hussein, for all his brutal crimes, had behaved with far more dignity in his final minutes than his seemingly thuggish executioners.\n''The execution operation has been mischaracterized for political purposes,'' said Sadiq al-Rikabi, an adviser to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who was present at the execution. Mr. Rikabi asserted that it had been carried out properly. ''What has happened is not an insult or degradation,'' he said.\nBut even as Mr. Maliki's government tried to defend its actions, the United States military, which had held Mr. Hussein in custody until it transferred him to Iraqi authorities about an hour before he was hanged, sought to distance itself from any responsibility for the scenes revealed in the video.\n''You know, if you're asking me, 'Would we have done things differently,' yes, we would have,'' said Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, an American military spokesman in Baghdad, at a news briefing on Wednesday.\n''But that's not our decision,'' he added. ''That's an Iraqi government decision.''\nThe reaction from the American military seemed to widen a rift that has been opening recently between the Shiite-led government of Mr. Maliki and its American supporters on a range of issues. They include the government's tolerance of militias, the recent discovery of the unofficial presence of Iranian military officers in Baghdad and the swiftness with which the Iraqis put Mr. Hussein to death after his appeals had been exhausted.\nMr. Maliki's office confirmed Wednesday that until Mr. Hussein's final hours, the American Embassy had sought to delay the execution long enough to avoid having it on a Muslim holiday and to resolve some remaining legal issues.\n''The Americans wanted to postpone it,'' said Maryam al-Rayas, a legal adviser to the prime minister. The decision to go ahead, Ms. Rayas said, was ''a victory for the Iraqi government.''\nThe prime minister had decided that beginning the new year with Mr. Hussein dead trumped all other considerations, including the advice of the embassy, said Ms. Rayas, who also characterized the time frame as reasonable.\n''There was no rush,'' she said.\nThe Iraqi government's detention of one of the guards generated some skepticism, with some Iraqi officials suggesting that Iraq was seeking a low-level scapegoat to blame for the almost Gothic display of intimidation and death that the images depict.\nMr. Rikabi refused to name or otherwise characterize the guard who had been arrested other than to say that he was being held in Baghdad after an investigation had determined that he had shot the video with a cellphone camera.\nBut Munkith al-Faroun, who was the prosecutor at Mr. Hussein's trial and was present at the execution, has said publicly that 2 of the 14 Iraqi officials and court representatives flown in by American helicopters to witness it were openly videotaping the event with cellphones.\nWhen asked about Mr. Faroun's statements, Mr. Rikabi said, ''I do not have this information.''\nOn Wednesday, The New York Times erroneously quoted Mr. Faroun as saying that one of the officials he had seen holding up a cellphone during the execution was Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. Maliki's national security adviser. Mr. Rubaie, in a telephone interview from London, said that along with all the Iraqi officials who were flown to the execution block by American helicopter, he had been searched at the Green Zone helipad and that his cellphone and even his keys were taken from him.\n''I did not have a cellphone in the execution chamber,'' he said.\nBut, further undermining the assertion that only a single guard had videotaped the execution, Mr. Rubaie said he had seen ''two or three'' others in the official contingent who did have cellphones. He suggested that they might have been among officials who arrived at Camp Justice, the American camp in northern Baghdad where the hanging took place, by car.\nThe failure to call more senior officials to account raised suspicions among some Iraqis. ''They want to blame it on a guard,'' one senior Iraqi official said.\nMr. Rubaie told CNN that there could have been as many as two others in the guard contingent who were associated with that scheme.\nIn the wake of the video's release, there were continuing condemnations of the way justice was meted out to Mr. Hussein after he lost his case in a court specially set up to judge crimes committed during his rule. On Wednesday, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Louise Arbour, renewed a previous call for restraint in carrying out the executions of two of Mr. Hussein's co-defendants who were also sentenced to death.\nThe manner of Mr. Hussein's execution appeared to give a boost to the remnants of his outlawed Baath Party. In the town of Huwaish, north of Baghdad, hundreds of people led by gunmen calling themselves the ''mujahedeen of the Baath Party'' marched in protest, and in the once prosperous Baghdad neighborhood of Monsour, a large black banner proclaimed that Mr. Hussein's death would set off fighting against ''the Americans and their followers.''\nThe banner was signed, in nicely printed lettering, ''Baath Party.''\nAt the same time, one of Mr. Hussein's most ruthless enforcers, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, who has eluded his American pursuers for nearly four years, was named the Baath Party leader on one of its Web sites. Although the claim could not be independently verified, Mr. Douri has long been considered a leader of the Baathist insurgency.\nAsked repeatedly to describe how the American military would have carried out the execution differently, General Caldwell declined to elaborate, saying that the question was hypothetical, since the Iraqis were in control once they received custody of Mr. Hussein outside the execution block.\n''It was not our decision as to what occurred at that point, but we would have done it differently,'' General Caldwell said.\nStill, Mr. Rikabi, the prime minister's political adviser, said that the government rejected all criticism of the execution, including the point at which one of the guards shouted, ''Moktada! Moktada! Moktada!'' as Mr. Hussein stood on the trapdoor of the gallows -- a reference to Moktada al-Sadr, the radical Shiite cleric who leads the militia called the Mahdi Army.\nThe exclamation came at the end of a standard Muslim prayer that both the guards and Mr. Hussein were saying aloud, Mr. Rikabi said. But the guards were from the Shiite south, where Mr. Sadr is popular, and the prayer there typically ends with the reference to him, Mr. Rikabi said.\n''If you go to any mosque in Karbala or Najaf you will hear them shouting like that,'' he said. ''This is their habit.''\nSeemingly contradicting his own government, Mr. Rubaie said he was ashamed of what had happened during the execution, which he described as ''unacceptable'' and ''disgusting.''\n''It is not professional, it's the wrong thing to do, and it should not have happened,'' he said. ''But it shouldn't divert the mind of the people from the crimes that Saddam has been condemned to death for.''\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ

1816295	Awaiting Bush's Iraq Plan, Democrats Weigh Replies	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Some key Senate Democrats say they could consider supporting a short-term increase in American troop levels in Iraq, a stance that reflects division within the party and could provide an opening for President Bush as he prepares to announce his revised plan for Iraq as early as next week.\nMr. Bush is expected to outline a strategy that would include adding to American forces, but would link that increase to a plan for economic development in Iraq. He has vowed to consult Congressional leaders before delivering his speech to the nation, and he began that process on Wednesday night by inviting House and Senate leaders to a White House reception, though officials said Iraq was not discussed.\nSenator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who will lead the Armed Services Committee, said he would not ''prejudge'' the president's proposal. While he would oppose an open-ended commitment, Mr. Levin said, he would not rule out supporting a plan to dispatch more troops if the proposal was tied to a broader strategy to begin reducing American involvement and sending troops home.\n''The American people are skeptical about getting in deeper,'' he said in an interview. ''But if it's truly conditional upon the Iraqis' actually meeting milestones and if it's part of an overall program of troop reduction that would begin in the next four to six months, it's something that would be worth considering.''\nBut Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who will become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has said he is opposed to increasing troop strength regardless of the plan, calling the idea the ''absolute wrong strategy.'' In interviews on Wednesday, several Democratic senators echoed Mr. Biden's view, saying they believed that sending more troops would not resolve the predicament in Iraq.\nDemocrats have become well-practiced at playing the roles of critic and skeptic, particularly when the subject is the war in Iraq. But as the party formally assumes control of Congress on Thursday, the divisions between the committee leaders, party leadership and rank-and-file senators illustrate the fresh burden they face of articulating a response to Mr. Bush's revised Iraq strategy.\nDemocrats may find it difficult to speak with one voice in response to Mr. Bush's plan. And at this point, party strategists said, they do not necessarily intend to. Over the next three weeks, Senate Democrats plan to call at least 13 hearings on Iraq, to be held by committees that include Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intelligence, Homeland Security and Judiciary.\nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates have agreed to testify, officials said, and invitations were sent this week to a raft of former administration officials, academics and military and Iraqi experts.\nShort of reducing military financing, which even the staunchest Congressional war critics have been reluctant to do, Democrats say they believe that one of the most effective tools they have to influence policy is to hold televised hearings.\n''What you are going to find is that this is no longer exclusively a Democratic criticism,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who is a member of the Armed Services Committee. ''A lot of Republicans are going to be standing up and saying, 'I don't understand what the president's strategy is.' A lot of people will be asking serious questions, and that will be healthy.''\nSenator Evan Bayh, an Indiana Democrat who also serves on the Armed Services Committee, said a troop increase ''might lead to a temporary abatement to the violence, but will only postpone the ultimate day of reckoning.''\nIn an interview, Mr. Bayh added, ''This problem is not going to be solved in Washington by the president of the United States; it can only be resolved by Iraqis.''\nIn a memorandum sent Wednesday to members of the Democratic caucus, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who becomes the majority leader, pledged that ''Democrats will work with Republicans to bring oversight and accountability'' to the war.\nMr. Reid has said that he will consider supporting a short-term increase in troops, but his spokesman, Jim Manley, declared, ''If it's not temporary in nature, it's a nonstarter.''\nRepresentative Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who will be the House majority leader, stopped short of saying that Democrats would exercise the power of the purse and decrease financing for American troops. Yet he said the new Congress was ''not going to sit silently by while policies are pursued with which we don't agree.''\nStill, the Bush administration intends to try to find support from the crop of newly elected members of Congress -- particularly those who were elected from Republican districts -- as the president works to build support for his Iraq strategy before the State of the Union address, now set for Jan. 23.\nOn the issue of sending more troops to Iraq, the White House is also reaching out to Senate Democrats who are facing re-election in 2008.\n''I am not in favor of that unless the president can convince me otherwise,'' Senator Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat who will serve on the Armed Services Committee, said of a possible troop increase.\n''I think that the Congress, after 9/11, was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on a whole range of issues related to Iraq,'' Mr. Pryor said, ''but we've been there four years now and it's time for him to clearly have the burden of proof.''\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ
1816296	Q & A	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E6D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Importing Contacts From Eudora\nQ. Is there a way to transfer a large address book from Eudora to another e-mail program?\nA. Relocating your Eudora e-mail address book is possible in most situations. The exact steps will vary based on the version of Eudora you have, the operating system you have and the new e-mail program you want to use.\nIn many cases, you can simply use an importing tool from your new e-mail software to pull in the address book from your Eudora program. Microsoft Outlook Express and Mozilla Thunderbird are two programs with such an option.\nSome versions of Eudora use a full-feature address book that can hold more information than just a name and an e-mail address, offering fields for notes, photos and multiple mailing addresses as well. If your Eudora address book is fairly detailed, you may want to consider getting conversion software that can move all of this information more accurately between mail programs.\nAddress Magic by Connected Software (www.connectedsw.com/AddressMagic.php) is one such utility for Windows. The eMailman Web site, which devotes itself to all things e-mail, has a page of links to other address-book conversion programs for Mac and Windows systems at www.emailman.com/conversion.\nUntangling A Mess of Cables\nQ. What can I do about the tangle of computer cables on and behind the desk?\nA. If you find your desk area has become knotted with snaking cables, there are a couple of approaches to untangling the problem.\nOne way to cut down on cables is to use wireless peripherals. For example, many mice, keyboards, speakers and other computer hardware items now come in Bluetooth versions that use radio signals to transmit data between devices instead of a cable. This option, however, can be expensive, and you may not be able to find wireless products for all of your hardware needs.\nA cable-management system is a cheaper option. Companies like Cable-Safe (www.cable-safe.com) offer several products for tying down (or tying up) the power cords and wires coming out of the computer.\nOffice supply stores like Staples (www.staples.com) and Office Depot (www.officedepot.com) also sell a variety of inexpensive cable ties, clips and sleeves to keep cords neatly bound and under control. Threading your cables through plastic tubing (like the kind sold for aquariums) is another option, and is sometimes favored by those with pets who like to nibble on computer cables.\nAdding Titles To Songs in iTunes\nQ. Sometimes when I try to import music from a CD into iTunes, the computer lists the songs as ''Track 01, Track 02,'' etc. Is there any way I can manually add the information for each song?\nA. The iTunes program pulls down album information over the Internet from the Gracenote CD Database (also known as the CDDB). If you are not online when you import the songs from the CD, iTunes cannot download the titles. You may also see the ''Track 01'' listing if you are connected to the Internet but there is no information about that particular album in the database.\nIf you imported the tracks when you were offline, you can go back and look for the song information the next time you fire up your Internet connection. Once you are online, go to iTunes and click on the nameless tracks you want to identify.\nOn the Windows version of the program, holding down the Shift key lets you select multiple tracks listed next to each other, and holding down the Control key while you click lets you select nonadjacent songs in a list. (On the Mac, the Shift and Command keys provide the same functions.)\nOnce you have selected your tracks, go to the Advanced menu and select ''Get CD Track Names.'' If iTunes can find the album, it should apply the song information to your selected tracks.\nIf all else fails, you can manually type in the information for each song. One way to do this is to select the song or album you want to change and choose Get Info from the File menu. Click the Info tab and make your changes. If you are editing a whole album's worth of tracks, click the next button to go to the next track and click the O.K. button when finished.\nJ. D. BIERSDORFER\nQ & A

I have a dream that we are approaching the day when a ranch-owning millionaire Republican like George Bush will make peace with a vineyard-owning millionaire Democrat like Nancy Pelosi.\nI have a dream that Pelosi, who was chauffeured to school as a child and who, with her investor husband, owns minority shares in the Auberge du Soleil resort hotel and the CordeValle Golf Club, will look over her famous strand of South Sea Tahitian pearls and forge bonds of understanding with the zillionaire corporate barons in the opposing party.\nFurthermore, I dream of a great harmonic convergence among the obscenely rich -- between Randian hedge fund managers on the right and helipad environmentalists on the left. I dream that the big-money people who seem to dominate our politics will put aside their partisan fury and discover the class solidarity that Karl Marx always said they shared, and their newfound civility will trickle down to the rest of us. I dream that Berkeley will make peace with Buckhead, Streisand with DeVos, Huffington with O'Reilly.\nI have my dreams, but of course, I am realistic too, for I am aware that at present there is no peace among the secluded island villas. I look out across the second homes of America and its surrounding tropical regions and I see polarization among the Kate Spade devotees and bitterness among the Rolexes. And I know that both Bush and Pelosi are part of an upper-income whirlwind of strife.\nSome people believe that Pelosi is an airhead, but that is wrong. Some people believe she is a radical San Francisco liberal, but that, too, is wrong. The main fact to know about Pelosi is that she is a creature of the modern fund-raising system. Some politicians rise because they run political machines. Some rise because they are great communicators. Pelosi has risen because she is a master of the thousand-dollar-a-plate fundraising circuit.\nLiving amid a web of investors, venture capitalists and West Coast technology tycoons, she raised heroic amounts of money for the Democratic Party before she ever thought of running for anything herself. In 1984, she was the state party chairwoman. In 1986, she was the national fund-raising chairwoman for the Senate Democrats.\nSince coming to the House, she has discovered what many a savvy pol has discovered -- that the fastest way to ascend in Congress is to raise a lot of money and give it to your peers.\nShe paid her dues selecting party favors, arranging seating charts (after that, legislation is easy), and laying thick dollops of obsequiousness on cranky old moguls and their helmet hair spa-spouses. She has done what all political fund-raisers do: tell rich people things they already believe, demonize the other side, motivate the giving with Manichaean tales of good versus evil.\nIt is no wonder The Los Angeles Times calls her a ''rabid Democrat'' or that Time magazine calls her ''hyperpartisan.'' It is not a surprise, as The Washington Post reported this week, that despite campaign promises about changing the tone in Washington, Pelosi has decided to exclude Republicans from the first burst of legislation -- to forbid them to offer amendments or alternatives.\nShe is part of the clash of the rival elites, with the dollars from Brookline battling dollars from Dallas, causing upper-class strife that even diminutive dogs, vibrant velvets and petite salades can't fully soothe.\nIt pains me to see plutocrats fight, because it sets such a poor example for those of us in the lower orders who fly commercial. It pains me even more because politicians from the rival blueblood clans go to embarrassing lengths to try to prove they are most authentically connected with working Americans.\nThink of John Kerry visiting a Wendy's or Bill Frist impersonating a Bible thumper. This week, witness Pelosi going on her all-about-me inauguration tour, which is designed to rebrand her as a regular Catholic grandma from Baltimore. Members of the middle classes never have to mount campaign swings to prove how regular they are, but these upper-bracket types can't help themselves, and they always lay it on too thick.\nSo I harbor my dreams of reconciliation, but in the meantime, why oh why can't we have a decent overclass in this country -- a group of highly attractive dimwits who spread bland but worthy stability over our political scene. Why oh why do we have to have this endless canapé war -- the people of the vineyard against the people of the ranch.\nOp-Ed Columnist
1816303	Another Thousand Lives	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	How long can this go on?\nSaddam is dead. The weapons of mass destruction were a mirage. More than 3,000 American G.I.s and scores of thousands of Iraqis have been killed. Voters in the United States have made it clear that they no longer support American involvement in this exercise in sustained barbarism. Incredibly, the U.S. military itself is turning against the war.\nAnd yet the president, against the counsel of his commanders on the ground, apparently is ready to escalate -- to send more American lives into the fire he set in Iraq.\nIn a devastating critique of the war, the newsweekly Army Times led its current edition with the headline: ''About-Face on the War -- After 3 years of support, troops sour on Iraq.'' The article detailed a Military Times Poll that found, for the first time, that ''more troops disapprove of the president's handling of the war than approve of it.''\nOnly a third of the service members surveyed approved of the president's conduct of the war, while 42 percent disapproved. Perhaps worse was the finding that only half of the troops believed that success in Iraq was likely.\nThe service members made it clear that they were not attacking their commander in chief personally. His overall approval rating remained high. What has turned them off has been the wretched reality of the war. In the article, David Segal, director of the Center for Research on Military Organization at the University of Maryland, said, ''They're seeing more casualties and fatalities and less progress.''\nIn other words, they're seeing the same thing everybody else is seeing -- except, perhaps, Mr. Bush.\nOn New Year's Day, readers of The New York Times could see the excruciating photo layout of the latest 1,000 American service members to die in Iraq. As in all wars, most of them were young. Many of them were smiling in the photos. All of them died unnecessarily.\nThe war has been an exercise in futility and mind-boggling incompetence, and yet our involvement continues -- with no end in sight, no plans for withdrawal, no idea of where we might be headed -- as if the U.S. had fallen into some kind of bizarrely destructive trance from which it is unable to awaken.\nAnd who is paying the price for this insanity -- apart from ordinary Iraqis, who are paying the most grievous price of all? The burden of the war in the U.S. is being shouldered overwhelmingly by a contingent of Americans whom no one would categorize as economically privileged.\nAs Lizette Alvarez and Andrew Lehren wrote in Monday's Times:\n''The service members who died during this latest period fit an unchanging profile. They were mostly white men from rural areas, soldiers so young they still held fresh memories of high school football heroics and teenage escapades. Many men and women were in Iraq for the second or third time. Some were going on their fourth, fifth or sixth deployment.''\nThere is no way that this can be justified. It is just wrong.\nI've said many times that if a war is worth fighting the way to do it is to mobilize the entire country, drawing the warriors from as wide a swath of the population as possible and raising taxes on everyone as part of an all-out effort to defeat a common enemy.\nThis war is not worth fighting. And if there were ever serious talk about enacting a draft or raising taxes to fight it, you'd see quickly enough that the vast majority of Americans would not find it worth fighting.\nThere must be a leader somewhere who can shake the U.S. out of this tragic hypnotic state, who can see that it is beyond crazy to continue our involvement in this war indefinitely, to sacrifice another 1,000 young lives, and then another thousand after that.\nAll of the tortured, twisted rationales for this war -- all of the fatuous intellectual pyrotechnics dreamed up to justify it -- have vaporized, and we're left with just the mad, mindless, meaningless and apparently endless slaughter.\nShakespeare, in ''Henry VI,'' said: ''Now thou art come unto a feast of death.''\nWe should end our participation in the feast of death in Iraq. It is criminal to continue feeding our troops into the slaughter.\nIf there were politicians here at home with some of the courage of the troops in the field, we could begin saving lives rather than watching helplessly as the Bush White House continues to sacrifice them. Three thousand and counting is enough.\nOp-Ed Columnist
1816304	My Father's Red Scare	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E5D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	THIS week the United States government will begin automatically declassifying hundreds of millions of documents from the cold war, under a law meant to streamline the cost and hassle of keeping secret files that are more than 25 years old. Among the dossiers bearing names like Alger Hiss, Theodore Hall and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg will be one labeled ''Frigyes Klein'': my father, Fred Klein.\nMy father was never a spy, never a member of the Communist Party. He came by ship to the United States in 1956, fleeing Communism during the Hungarian revolution to pursue the American dream. He worked on a Ford automobile assembly line in Cincinnati by day and moonlighted sharpening lawnmowers at night, saving enough money in a few years to buy a small house. To him, treasonous behavior meant buying a car made outside of America. Nonetheless, as I discovered recently, the F.B.I. kept a file on him from the day he arrived in the United States.\nJ. Edgar Hoover sent a personal memo to the C.I.A. director calling my father a person of current interest; the case was handled by Alan Belmont, a top bureau official who was instrumental in the case against the Rosenbergs. I discovered this after filing a Freedom of Information Act inquiry as part of some family research for a book. I was shocked to receive 50 F.B.I. pages riddled with my father's name, the edges dotted with weathered stamps marked ''SECRET.'' I matched what I read with stories I remembered from when he was alive, and began piecing the case together.\nMy father once mentioned that during the voyage over, he got into an altercation with another refugee, a man he didn't know from a town he had never visited. According to the file, this man told an Army captain that my father had been an agent for AVO -- the Hungarian K.G.B. -- in his town of Tatabanya, that he had interrogated and beaten the man for speaking out against the regime, and that he'd subsequently sent the man to a prison camp. The story was a complete fabrication.\nI can only imagine how many names of patriotic, law-abiding Eastern European immigrants like my father are to be found in the millions of documents being released by the F.B.I. and other agencies. In a recent article in this newspaper about the declassification law, L. Britt Snider, a former intelligence official who is advising the White House on the process, warned that most of the documents were boring and suggested that the agencies concentrate first on those that were interesting and important.\nBut I would caution intelligence officials not to discount both the interest and the importance of files like my father's, if only to avoid repeating some of the embarrassing legacies of the cold-war era.\nIt has already happened. Last year a Syrian informant told the New York police that five Arabs he knew were importing weapons for a suicide bombing. After several weeks and the involvement of more than 30 New York police agents, as well as federal customs officials, the F.B.I. and Israeli law enforcement, it was determined that the ''weapons'' were in fact jewelry. As with my father, the informant had a vendetta and had lied to the authorities.\nMy father's case remained open for more than a decade. His F.B.I. file contains a creepy secret memo from 1963 in which a mole inside the Hungarian community in Cincinnati reported to his handler that he had ''heard rumors [about] a family named Klein who do not associate with the Hungarian group.'' The fact that this level of surveillance was taking place behind my family's back seven years after they arrived in America says something about the pathological level of paranoia during the Red Scare.\nThe Frigyes Klein file was finally closed in 1968, only after people from the informant's Hungarian hometown admitted to an F.B.I. special agent that my father had not been with the secret police. Twenty-five years from now, some unsuspecting son may stumble across a file about his own father -- a patriotic, law-abiding Arab immigrant whose name inexplicably ended up on a list. Like the cold-war-era files, these new ones being drawn up could leave a historical paper trail about an era of scares and witch hunts -- if intelligence officials do not learn from the lessons in the documents released today.\nOp-Ed Contributor Peter W.

1816305	Getting the Middle East Back on Our Side	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E5D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	THE Iraq Study Group report was released into a sea of unrealistic expectations. Inevitably, it disappointed hopes for a clear path through the morass of Iraq, because there is no ''silver bullet'' solution to the difficulties in which we find ourselves.\nBut the report accomplished a great deal. It brought together some of America's best minds across party lines, and it outlined with clarity and precision the key factors at issue in Iraq. In doing so, it helped catalyze the debate about our Iraq policy and crystallize the choices we face. Above all, it emphasized the importance of focusing on American national interests, not only in Iraq but in the region.\nHowever, the report, which calls the situation in Iraq ''grave and deteriorating,'' does not focus on what could be the most likely outcome of its analysis. Should the Iraqis be unable or unwilling to play the role required of them, the report implies that we would have no choice but to withdraw, and then blame our withdrawal on Iraqi failures. But here the report essentially stops.\nAn American withdrawal before Iraq can, in the words of the president, ''govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself'' would be a strategic defeat for American interests, with potentially catastrophic consequences both in the region and beyond. Our opponents would be hugely emboldened, our friends deeply demoralized.\nIran, heady with the withdrawal of its principal adversary, would expand its influence through Hezbollah and Hamas more deeply into Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and Jordan. Our Arab friends would rightly feel we had abandoned them to face alone a radicalism that has been greatly inflamed by American actions in the region and which could pose a serious threat to their own governments.\nThe effects would not be confined to Iraq and the Middle East. Energy resources and transit choke points vital to the global economy would be subjected to greatly increased risk. Terrorists and extremists elsewhere would be emboldened. And the perception, worldwide, would be that the American colossus had stumbled, was losing its resolve and could no longer be considered a reliable ally or friend -- or the guarantor of peace and stability in this critical region.\nTo avoid these dire consequences, we need to secure the support of the countries of the region themselves. It is greatly in their self-interest to give that support, just as they did in the 1991 Persian Gulf conflict. Unfortunately, in recent years they have come to see it as dangerous to identify with the United States, and so they have largely stood on the sidelines.\nA vigorously renewed effort to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict could fundamentally change both the dynamics in the region and the strategic calculus of key leaders. Real progress would push Iran into a more defensive posture. Hezbollah and Hamas would lose their rallying principle. American allies like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the gulf states would be liberated to assist in stabilizing Iraq. And Iraq would finally be seen by all as a key country that had to be set right in the pursuit of regional security.\nArab leaders are now keen to resolve the 50-year-old dispute. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel may be as well. His nation's long-term security can only be assured by resolving this issue once and for all. However, only the American president can bring them to the same table.\nResuming the Arab-Israeli peace process is not a matter of forcing concessions from Israel or dragooning the Palestinians into surrender. Most of the elements of a settlement are already agreed as a result of the negotiations of 2000 and the ''road map'' of 2002. What is required is to summon the will of Arab and Israeli leaders, led by a determined American president, to forge the various elements into a conclusion that all parties have already publicly accepted in principle.\nAs for Syria and Iran, we should not be afraid of opening channels of communication, but neither should we rush to engage them as negotiating ''partners.'' Moreover, these two countries have differing interests, expectations and points of leverage and should not be treated as though they are indistinguishable.\nSyria cannot be comfortable clutched solely in the embrace of Iran, and thus prying it away may be possible. Syria also has much to gain from a settlement with Israel and internal problems that such a deal might greatly ease. If we can make progress on the Palestinian front before adding Syria to the mix, it would both avoid overloading Israel's negotiating capacity and increase the incentives for Damascus to negotiate seriously.\nIran is different. It may not be wise to make Iran integral to the regional strategy at the outset. And the nuclear issue should be dealt with on a separate track. In its present state of euphoria, Iran has little interest in making things easier for us. If, however, we make clear our determination, and if the other regional states become more engaged in stabilizing Iraq, the Iranians might grow more inclined to negotiate seriously.\nWHILE negotiations on the Arab-Israel peace process are under way, we should establish some political parameters inside Iraq that encourage moves toward reconciliation and unified government in Iraq. Other suggested options, such as an ''80 percent solution'' that excludes the Sunnis, or the division of the country into three parts, are not only inconsistent with reconciliation but would almost certainly pave the way to broader regional conflict and must be avoided.\nAmerican combat troops should be gradually redeployed away from intervening in sectarian conflict. That necessarily is a task for Iraqi troops, however poorly prepared they may be. Our troops should be redirected toward training the Iraqi Army, providing support and backup, combating insurgents, attenuating outside intervention and assisting in major infrastructure protection.\nThat does not mean the American presence should be reduced. Indeed, in the immediate future, the opposite may be true, though any increase in troop strength should be directed at accomplishing specific, defined missions. A generalized increase would be unlikely to demonstrably change the situation and, consequently, could result in increased clamor for withdrawal. But the central point is that withdrawing combat forces should not be a policy objective, but rather, the result of changes in our strategy and success in our efforts.\nAs we work our way through this seemingly intractable problem in Iraq, we must constantly remember that this is not just a troublesome issue from which we can walk away if it seems too costly to continue. What is at stake is not only Iraq and the stability of the Middle East, but the global perception of the reliability of the United States as a partner in a deeply troubled world. We cannot afford to fail that test.\nOp-Ed Contributor Brent Scowcroft was national security adviser to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and George H. W. Bush.

1816306	A Country Less Dependent on Oil Is Free to Make Other New Year's Resolutions	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E4D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Well, another New Year's Day has come and gone. A string of holiday meals and sitting on the couch have, no doubt, started another wave of resolutions to get some exercise and go on a diet. But after seeing gas prices pass $3 a gallon last year, hearing all the talk about global warming and having a bad feeling about all the bluster coming from the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a great many folks wish the economy would go on a diet, too, and stop using so much energy.\nSome of the fear over energy and the economy, certainly, resides in people old enough to remember some grimmer New Year's Days. In 1973, OPEC imposed an oil embargo against the United States and Western Europe for their support of Israel in the Yom Kippur war. New Year's Day 1974 came in the middle of the first great energy crisis. Oil prices shot up with the embargo and the American economy collapsed into recession -- but not without igniting inflation first. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had birthed our first stagflation.\nNew Year's 1980 was even worse: the Iranian revolution, American hostages and oil prices pushing $40 a barrel. The second great energy crisis once again plunged the American economy into a recession coupled with high inflation.\nOur past seems to show that when oil prices rise too much, our economy cannot grow. These lessons have been taken to heart by Mr. Ahmadinejad and Osama bin Laden as each has contemplated ways to cripple the American economy.\nBut the data shows that much has changed since the wrenching days of the 1970s, for American industry at least. The energy used for each dollar of gross domestic product in 1980 was almost 70 percent greater than it is today. While we have collectively wrung our hands over the decline of manufacturing in the country, it has also reduced the relationship between energy prices and growth.\nManufacturing industries consume about 25,000 B.T.U.'s of energy for each dollar of gross domestic product they generate. The most energy-intensive sectors, like the steel, iron ore and aluminum industries, consume about 70,000 B.T.U.'s. Outside of manufacturing, the economy uses less than 6,000. Hospitals, law offices and banks just are not the same as blast furnaces and smelters.\nSo now when the price of oil goes up, as when it almost hit $80 a barrel in 2006 (close to the highest it has ever been, even accounting for all the inflation since the previous energy crises), it does not automatically mean recession. Indeed, it caused only a ripple this last year. Unemployment and inflation both stayed quite low.\nSomewhere in the world, Mr. Ahmadinejad and Mr. bin Laden may be poring over the statistics on the Energy Information Administration's Web site and feeling a nagging pang in their gut. OPEC's ability to impose an oil embargo on the West the way it did in 1974 and bring the economy into recession is highly limited today.\nParadoxically, although the economy seems somewhat less prone to disruption from energy crises, there remains one enormous group that suffers from high prices: us, the car drivers. Industry has become less and less dependent on energy over time, but the average American commuter is now more dependent.\nFrom 1980 to 1990, rising Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency standards forced automakers to improve car mileage significantly. Average miles per gallon rose very much in parallel to the energy improvements in the wider economy. That ended in 1990, however. The fuel economy standards on cars stopped rising. Our regulations are now much less stringent than those in Europe, Japan and even China. We also shifted to driving trucks and sport utility vehicles. We moved farther from our places of work and drove a lot more. Since 1990, the number of gallons we use, even on a per vehicle basis, rose substantially.\nSo as the price of oil neared $80 a barrel last year and gasoline exceeded $3 a gallon, it did not bring the economy to its knees, the way previous oil crises did. It just hit all of us driving our cars. Mr. Ahmadinejad may not have the ability to terrorize the economy, but he can certainly aggravate soccer moms in their minivans or commuters stuck in traffic by making them pay more.\nIf it were November, perhaps the message would be to be thankful for what we have been able to change. But it is not. It is New Year's so the message is different. Forget about New Year's resolutions for the economy and stick to your own. Next time you need to get somewhere, toss the keys and walk.\nECONOMIC SCENE Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and a research fellow at the American Bar Foundation.

1816307	Markets Finish Mixed as Fed Hints at Nagging Concern With Inflation	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E4D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Stocks surged early yesterday, the first trading day of 2007, but fell sharply after minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting indicated that inflation remained the chief concern of policy makers even as they started to worry about a weakening economy. Markets closed mixed for the day.\nThe Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down slightly, at 1,416.63, after being up 0.8 percent. The Nasdaq composite index surged 1.6 percent early, but reversed course in the afternoon, falling 0.9 percent; it closed up 7.87 points, or 0.33 percent, at 2,423.16.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average also seesawed to a modest gain of 11.37 points, closing at 12,474.52. Bonds were up slightly and the dollar rose against the euro and yen.\nLike markets in Europe and Asia, American stock markets, which were closed Tuesday in observance of the day of mourning for President Gerald R. Ford, began the year on an upbeat note. Investors were encouraged by Wal-Mart's posting of sales that were stronger than expected, and by a report showing an increase in manufacturing activity last month.\nBut the rally started to sag in early afternoon and collapsed shortly after the Fed released the minutes of its Dec. 12 meeting. Energy stocks were among the biggest losers as crude oil futures fell by $2.73, to $58.32 a barrel, the first time they have closed below $60 since November.\nThe Fed, as it has done repeatedly in recent months, indicated in its minutes that while inflation had moderated, the central bank's policy makers were worried that it remained too high and that they might need to raise short-term interest rates. The minutes noted, however, that one unnamed member of the policy-making committee wanted the Fed to acknowledge that it could also cut rates to reinvigorate the economy.\n''It was a blunt reminder to the stock market that the Fed's going to err on the side of avoiding inflation,'' said Ethan S. Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers.\nStocks climbed steadily in the last six months of 2006, partly on the expectation that the Fed, which last raised interest rates in June, to 5.25 percent, would start cutting rates in the first half of 2007. But some economists and market specialists have suggested that that view was inconsistent with investors' optimism that the economy and corporate profits would hold up well in the coming year.\n''There is a sense in the stock market that you can have your cake and eat it too, that you can have good growth and rate cuts from the Fed,'' Mr. Harris said.\nThe bond and futures markets, by contrast, have become a little less hopeful in recent weeks about interest rate cuts, and are now priced with the expectation that the Fed's first rate cut will come in late June. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which move in the opposite direction of the price, have risen to 4.66 percent, from a low of 4.02 percent at the start of December. Bond prices and yields were little changed in yesterday's trading after the Fed's announcement.\n''The bond market got the reaction to the Fed minutes right,'' said Joseph Biondo, a senior portfolio manager at Biondo Investment Advisors, ''and the stock market didn't.''\nStill, market specialists said the stocks' late-afternoon recovery suggested that investors were not as moved by the Fed as it first seemed. Also, the energy sector was responsible for much of the decline in stock prices -- the S.& P. Energy index fell 3.7 percent for the day. Analysts said warmer-than-expected temperatures on the East Coast helped drive down prices for crude oil and other commodities.\nAnother concern for the markets is the possibility that profit growth will slow. Companies will start reporting results for the fourth quarter later this month and, for the first time in four and a half years, profits may not post double-digit gains, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for S.& P.'s Equity Research Service. He said he expected stocks to register a gain in 2007, but that the markets might first experience a correction typically seen late in an economic expansion.\n''There is a healthy level of skepticism that is coming back into equity valuations,'' he said.\nThe next few days could prove critical, specialists note, citing a market truism that the markets' performance in the first five trading days of a year is a harbinger of their performance in the coming 12 months.\nWhile it is too early to draw those broader conclusions, the market did appear to start off on a new footing. Toward the end of last year, volatility, a measure of the sharpness of the stock market's movements, fell to historic lows.\n''Volatility is back,'' said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC Advisors. ''That's maybe the story for 2007. We have not seen it for a while. At this point in prior business cycles, we saw volatility spike back up.''\nFollowing are the results of yesterday's auction for four-week Treasury bills:\n(000 omitted in dollar figures)\nPrice -- 99.629 High Rate -- 4.760 Coupon Yield -- 4.844 Low Rate -- 4.730 Median Rate -- 4.750 Total applied for -- $32,054,700 Accepted -- $11,555,120 Noncompetitive -- $275,708\nThe four-week bills mature February 01, 2007.\nSTOCKS & BONDS
1816308	An Ousted Chief's Going-Away Pay Is Seen by Many as Typically Excessive	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E4D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Robert L. Nardelli's rich compensation and poor performance at Home Depot have long been cited by shareholder activists as a prime example of what they view as excessive executive pay. Some union members dressed up in giant chicken outfits to protest the board's reluctance to clip Mr. Nardelli's wings.\nWhat did all their outrage get them? Mr. Nardelli's removal -- and at least a $210 million bill for a golden handshake on his way out the door.\nYesterday, Home Depot's board ousted Mr. Nardelli as chairman and chief executive in a surprising move that highlights the growing influence of investors pressuring boards to rein in executive pay. But it also illustrates another point: Even when their voices are heard, shareholders often wind up holding the bag.\nAt Home Depot, Mr. Nardelli is expected to receive an exit package worth more than $210 million on top of the nearly $64 million he was paid during his six years at the helm. That equals about $45 million a year; over that same period, Home Depot's stock has fallen from over $50 a share early in his tenure to $41.16 just before Mr. Nardelli's resignation was announced.\nBy contrast, Home Depot's chief competitor, Lowe's, has paid its chief executives about one-third of what Mr. Nardelli made during the same time, while investors have enjoyed a healthy increase in their holdings.\nMr. Nardelli's compensation may have a prominent place in the pantheon of pay-for-failure, but his arrangement is by no means unique.\n''The company is big, the underperformance is significant and the numbers are very large,'' said Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard Law School professor who is an outspoken critic of executive pay. ''But each of the pieces that lead to the decoupling of pay from performance are very common to the executive compensation landscape.''\nAcross corporate America, chief executives have been walking away with lavish riches even when their companies fail to perform, according to an analysis by the Corporate Library.\nAt Pfizer, Henry A. McKinnell left with an exit package worth $213 million, including an $82 million pension, after the pharmaceutical giant he ran for six years lost over $137 billion in market value on his watch. Jay Sidhu, the former chairman and chief executive of Sovereign Bank, received $44 million last fall when he was removed after a bitter proxy fight.\nMorgan Stanley's board awarded Philip J. Purcell an exit package worth more than $95 million when he was forced out in July 2005. Tom Freston, who was ousted at Viacom in September, and Carleton S. Fiorina, who was forced out by Hewlett-Packard in February 2005, were handed tens of millions of dollars when they abruptly stepped down.\n''You can call them pay-for-failure packages,'' said Jesse M. Fried, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has been critical of excessive compensation packages. ''You get what you pay for.''\nThe reason highlights the ''Heads I win; tails I win'' nature of executive pay -- especially for chief executives hired to orchestrate a turnaround. Over the last decade, many boards and big investors bought into the belief that a celebrity C.E.O. or corporate savior was vital for success.\nThere have certainly been a number of examples of chief executives who delivered outsize gains to their shareholders, enjoying big rewards themselves.\nAs a result, most executives have been able to take advantage of the perception that they would deliver big rewards to negotiate employment contracts that guaranteed them bonuses when they arrived, paid them handsomely with stock options during their careers -- and in many cases, ensured severance contracts providing millions more once they left.\n''The justification that is given for these big executive pay packages is that we have to give them very strong incentives to create shareholder value,'' Mr. Fried said. ''But if you are allowing them to walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars even if they do extremely poorly, you are undermining that case.''\nThat appears to be what happened at Home Depot. When Mr. Nardelli was hired in December 2000, he was seen as a strong leader who could help restore Home Depot to the luster it enjoyed in its early years. Home Depot's board offered him a contract that would pay him well if times were bad and even more if the company's performance was better.\nMr. Nardelli received $63.5 million in salary, bonuses, and other compensation, including $21 million in forgiven loans and company-paid taxes during his career at Home Depot. In that time, however, he failed to turn the company around.\nYesterday, details of his $210 million exit package were released. As part of the negotiated arrangement, Mr. Nardelli is expected to take home a severance payment of $20 million, a $32 million pension, a $2 million 401(k) and $139 million in deferred equity awards and stock options that he now will be able to cash early. That amount could grow if Home Depot's shares rebound under a new leader.\nMr. Nardelli also stands to receive another $18 million in ''other entitlements,'' which the company did not disclose, but will be paid over the next four years so long as he does not violate a noncompete contract.\nUnder his employment contract, Mr. Nardelli was eligible for benefits like life insurance, and dental and medical coverage for several years after his departure. It is unclear whether he will still receive them.\n''When you guarantee income to an executive regardless of performance, you end up paying and you rarely get performance,'' Mr. Hodgson said. ''The board could have saved themselves hundreds of millions of dollars and still have their reputations intact.''\nRepresentative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is the new chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, called Mr. Nardelli's exit package ''confirmation of the need to deal with a pattern of C.E.O. pay that appears to be out of control.''\nSome investors were so happy to see Mr. Nardelli leave that they declared victory -- no matter how hollow. They are holding out hope that his ignominious exit will serve as an example to others.\nWilliam C. Thompson Jr., New York City comptroller, said he hoped ''all the attention that has been focused on him -- with his excessive pay and his underperformance -- will lead to change within this company and send a message to other companies.''\nStill, he conceded that the $210 million exit package was something ''we would have preferred not happen.''\nA CHAIRMAN'S FALL
1816309	The Ugly Death of Saddam Hussein	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E2D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Saddam Hussein deserves no one's pity. But as anyone who has seen the graphic cellphone video of his hanging can testify, his execution bore little resemblance to dispassionate, state-administered justice. The condemned dictator appeared to have been delivered from United States military custody into the hands of a Shiite lynch mob.\nFor the Bush administration, which insists it went to war in Iraq to implant democracy and justice, those globally viewed images were a shaming embarrassment. Unfortunately, all Americans will be blamed, while the Iraqi people are now likely to suffer still more. What should have been a symbolic passage out of Iraq's darkest era will instead fuel a grim new era of spiraling sectarian vengeance.\nThe ugly episode shows why Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki is never likely to produce the national unity government that Washington keeps demanding and that Iraq so desperately needs.\nMr. Maliki is now scrambling to extricate himself from the public relations disaster. Yesterday, his office announced the arrest of a guard who allegedly took the unauthorized video. But the fundamental blame belongs to Mr. Maliki, who personally orchestrated the timing and circumstances of last Saturday's execution.\nMr. Maliki ignored pleas for delay from Washington and the legal niceties of Iraq's Constitution. He rushed to deliver Mr. Hussein's death as a holiday gift to his hard-line Shiite constituency, especially followers of the radical cleric and militia leader Moktada al-Sadr, who were allowed to chant abuse at the condemned dictator while he stood at the gallows with the noose around his neck.\nMr. Maliki's usual cheerleaders, President Bush and Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, have distanced themselves from this repellent spectacle. Yet the Bush administration again finds that it has little credibility to lecture anyone on the basic dignity due to detainees. The Washington Post reported yesterday on an internal F.B.I. investigation that revealed a pattern of deliberate taunting of the religious beliefs of Muslim prisoners at Guantánamo.\nAs Mr. Bush prepares his latest plan for Iraq, he must face up to bleak realities. As of January, 2007, Iraq lacks an army capable of standing on its own. It lacks a justice system that puts the rule of law over political expediency, while its police force is dominated by sectarian militias and thugs. Most crucially, it lacks a government committed to protect the rights and personal safety of all Iraqis.\nMost Americans, whatever their view of the war, understand that the rule of Saddam Hussein brought a murderous curse and untold suffering upon the Iraqi people. Mr. Hussein has now gone to his grave. But the outrageous manner of his killing, deliberately mimicking his own depraved methods, assures that his cruelty will outlive him.\nEditorial
1816310	New Congress, Leftover Challenge	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE2D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The nation should welcome the ambitious agenda being offered today by the new Congress's Democratic majority, from raising the minimum wage to advancing stem cell research to restoring oversight of the executive branch. But the real test for the 110th Congress will be its willingness to clean up its own act by adopting forceful and credible ethics reform. That is what the Democratic leadership promised voters. Any hesitation will be rightly seen as a cynical re-endorsement of the Capitol's lobbyist-enabling, corruption-steeped business as usual.\nCongress's ethics rules have been rife with loopholes and wrist-slapping punishments that grease rather than police the quid pro quo world of Washington. Fixing some of these problems requires nothing more than a majority vote on the House or Senate rules.\nHouse Democrats appear ready to start with a firm, and long needed, ban on gifts, entertainment and junket travel -- including low-cost V.I.P. rides on corporate jets -- arranged by lobbyists or their clients. The ban should cover staffers as well, and the Senate should match it. Even that will require wary monitoring, particularly of a provision that would allow members preapproved day trips for speeches, with travel paid by non-lobbying groups.\nBoth houses should also bar Congressional alumni and other lobbyists from the debating floors and other Capitol inner sanctums. And members of Congress with other ambitions should be blocked from slyly negotiating lucrative private jobs while they're still on the public's payroll and sworn to defend the public's interest. There should be early disclosure of all job feelers.\nThe back-scratching closeness of politicians seeking campaign donations and deep-pocket interests seeking favors is a capital disgrace. Part of the solution is to douse their dealings with sunshine through prompt and detailed filing disclosures. And there should be full disclosure of the cornucopia of ''earmarks'' -- costly favors inserted without debate or any requirement to disclose authorship in mammoth spending bills. Earmark authors and beneficiaries should be unmasked in time to be mocked by taxpayers.\nBroader reforms will require longer legislative debate, not just a rule change. Paramount is the need to create an independent office for ethics enforcement to end the clubbiness that more often than not covers up or excuses abuses. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ordered a bipartisan study of this vital proposal by March. We expect this overdue step to receive the forceful support of Ms. Pelosi and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader. The voters are watching, and lawmakers dare not slip away from the promise to clean up their act.\nEditorial
1816311	Out With the Old	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	There was good news and bad news yesterday for shareholders of Home Depot. The good news is that Robert Nardelli, the imperious chief executive who had presided over a difficult, stagnant period for the company, has resigned. The bad news is that he'll be taking $210 million worth of compensation with him, one of the highest severance packages ever, which is saying a lot in this era of runaway executive pay.\nMr. Nardelli may be best known for his shocking performance at the company's annual meeting in May, which has become a symbol of the arrogance of overpaid, out-of-touch, and unresponsive executives.\nAs Joe Nocera reported in The Times after attending the meeting, Mr. Nardelli restricted shareholder comments to one minute and one question each -- enforced with large digital timers. When one shareholder asked about perceived conflicts of interest for the board of directors, Mr. Nardelli refused to answer, declaring, ''This is not the forum in which to address these comments.''\nThe meeting, of course, was exactly the forum for shareholders to voice concerns about the board of directors they were being asked to elect.\nTop executives, like Mr. Nardelli, have been coddled to the point that they expect and receive ''golden hellos'' worth millions on their way in, golden parachutes worth even more on their way out, and the equivalent of golden seat cushions to park on comfortably throughout their tenure -- often largely unrelated to their actual performance.\nWhile the fortune Mr. Nardelli is taking with him -- including a $20 million cash severance payment -- sticks in the craw, we hope this will be the beginning of a new era of accountable management for Home Depot.

1816312	A Big Hero in the Big City	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E1D81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	New Yorkers have long rolled their eyes when politicians, TV commercials and after-dinner speakers endlessly extolled ''small-town values.'' The truth is that integrity, compassion and heroism are no scarcer on the sidewalks of Chicago or Harlem than they are in Dubuque. If anyone doubts this, they should consider Wesley Autrey's heroic turn at the 137th Street and Broadway subway station this week.\nMr. Autrey, a construction worker who lives in the neighborhood, was riding the subway with his 6- and 4-year-old daughters when a young film student had a seizure on the platform. He and two women went to help the young man, 20-year-old Cameron Hollopeter, but Mr. Hollopeter stumbled while he was getting up and fell onto the tracks.\nAs a No. 1 train approached, Mr. Autrey jumped down onto the tracks and lay on top of Mr. Hollopeter, pushing into a space that was about a foot deep. Five cars traveled over the two men before the train screeched to a halt. It passed just inches above Mr. Autrey's head, leaving grease on his knit cap.\nMr. Autrey's instinctive willingness to put his life on the line is not something most people would expect to encounter in New York City. But then, the negative stereotypes about New York have never stood up to the facts. Uncharitable? New York ranks first in a newly released state-by-state study of giving by the Boston College Center on Wealth and Philanthropy. Less committed than the rest of the country to the nation's defense? New York City has lost more of its residents in battle in Iraq than the average state.\nNot willing to come to the aid of strangers? Mr. Autrey put that one to rest in dramatic fashion. Small-town values are certainly an important part of what makes America great, but so are big-city values, which in many cases are exactly the same.\nEditorial

Brain Calisthenics'' (front page, Dec. 27):\nIt is unfortunate that the business of promoting ''brain health'' is increasingly populated by companies offering products with great promises but little scientific support.\nTask-specific, computer-based training products have not demonstrated any significant impact on the daily lives of older adults. More comprehensive approaches offering intellectual challenge, social engagement, healthy lifestyles and the management of chronic illnesses that may affect the brain, like hypertension and diabetes, are far more likely to be effective in maintaining cognitive vitality.\nDespite a boom in brain health technology, recent scientific research supports the view of the ancient Greeks: that having a healthy mind is the result of an integrated approach emphasizing overall health and well-being.\nEven in brain health, consumers need to distinguish the snake oil from the real deal.\nCynthia R. Green Howard Fillit, M.D. New York, Dec. 27, 2006\nThe writers are, respectively, the founding director of the Memory Enhancement Program at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and executive director of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation.\nTo the Editor:\nI am 84, and my hobby and pleasure for the last five years has been writing limerick poems for friends' birthdays, anniversaries and retirements.\nKeep in mind that a limerick is a five-line poem in which lines 1, 2 and 5 rhyme, as do lines 3 and 4; the last line must also be the punch line.\nTo those who think that writing one isn't the best brain exercise there is, I suggest they try it.\nLee Goldsmith Miami, Dec. 27, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nThere is a common attitude in popular culture that mental exercise is a helpful way of warding off age-related cognitive declines, stoked in recent months by the popularity of games like Nintendo's ''Brain Age'' and by Web sites like HappyNeuron.com, which your article mentions.\nUnfortunately, the empirical evidence just isn't there. Not only has physical exercise been shown to be better than mental exercise at preventing declines, as your article mentions, but there is also little evidence that mental exercise has any benefit at all.\nA recent overarching review of the mental exercise literature published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science shows no effect of mental exercise that cannot be explained by what are termed self-selection effects -- those who are able and willing to undergo mental exercise regimes are in better cognitive shape to begin with, and therefore experience fewer losses as they age.\nWhile mental exercise may certainly have personal meaning for some people, its benefits are far from robust. Older adults should not bank on mental exercise as a guarantor of cognitive health.\nJosh Penslar Toronto, Dec. 27, 2006\nTo the Editor:\nI am a 77 years young retiree enjoying my life to the fullest. You did not mention one aspect of keeping our aging brains young -- music.\nRemember that many musicians, like the cellist Pablo Casals and the cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, have continued to play music and conduct orchestras long into their later years.\nI am a choral singer, and have been for 60 years. I am also a member of the Seattle Symphony Chorale. I sang ''Messiah'' three nights last week, and I'm about to start three more evenings of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. I sang most of ''Messiah'' from memory, looking at the score only to remind myself when to enter.\nNow please tell me whether it is too much to expect a 77-year-old brain whose native language is Korean to have memorized the entire bass section of ''Messiah'' with the music score and texts in English.\nTed Kim Seattle, Dec. 27, 2006\nTo the Editor:\n''As Minds Age, What's Next? Brain Calisthenics'' could be a milestone in treating memory loss in the elderly.\nI am 85, and have been a substitute teacher for the last eight years for kindergarten through 12th grade. Substituting as a first-grade teacher in computer class and for seniors in calculus can be a real challenge to anybody's brain.\nBut I have no problem in keeping up with 20 kids; it has kept me active. I still ski and work out daily.\nMost people think that I'm in my mid-60s. And it helps that I still have all my hair.\nClifford Ashley Lake Placid, N.Y., Dec. 27, 2006

Regular visits to a far-off prison are beyond the means of inmates' families. The state nonetheless forces them to pay 630 percent more than the average consumer to talk over the phone with imprisoned loved ones.\nAs I pointed out in a brief challenging the state system, this leaves the children of inmates at greater risk for aggressive behavior and criminal involvement. The positive influence of phone communication can combat these dangerous trends.\nProtecting New Yorkers requires more than bricks and mortar. Common sense and decency are also needed.\nBetsy Gotbaum Public Advocate New York, Dec. 22, 2006

We have a fresh Congress and the promise of new approaches. This could be the year to break free from the crippling grip of private insurance companies and provide health care for all, as every other advanced country has long been doing.\nMedicare, despite some fumbles, works extraordinarily well for millions of our senior citizens. Why not for all? This year we should end our national shame with respect to health care and join the civilized world.\nDora B. Goldstein Palo Alto, Calif., Jan. 1, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nPaul Krugman's proposed solution for our health care mess is half right. We do need a public tax-supported insurance system, like Medicare, to replace the hundreds of private, high-overhead insurance companies. These take 10 to 15 percent of the health care dollar and give little in return.\nBut that would not control rising costs. Despite much lower overhead, Medicare's costs have risen nearly as rapidly as the private sector's. That's because economic incentives encourage overuse of expensive medical technology even when it is of unproven or marginal benefit.\nFee-for-service payments of physicians, investor-owned facilities and a market ideology will have to be replaced by salaried physicians working in prepaid medical groups and by nonprofit ownership. A difficult agenda, but nothing less will do.\nArnold S. Relman, M.D. Boston, Jan. 2, 2007\nThe writer is professor emeritus of medicine and social medicine at Harvard Medical School and a former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.\nTo the Editor:\nWith a tragic milestone reached in Iraq, it is noteworthy that the milestone of 50 million Americans with no medical care coverage is rapidly approaching.\nFew working Americans can afford to pay for their health care if they are seriously ill or injured, or for insurance even when they can obtain it. Employers pay about half of health care costs, which are rising faster than inflation because of many factors, including advances in technology and expensive new medicines.\nAs a doctor, I often see the tragedy when patients delay needed care because they can't pay for it. As an employer, I am faced annually with whether to accept onerous increases in insurance costs or to ask my employees to shoulder more of the burden. Our fragmented payment system for health care makes no sense.\nI hope that Congress will begin at once to rectify this disgrace.\nWilliam E. Bowman, M.D. Greensboro, N.C., Jan. 1, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nPaul Krugman is correct that the nation must find a path to universal, publicly financed and administered health care. But where is that path?\nThe fiscal consequences of a leap to such health care appear to be insurmountable, yet could it be done in steps?\nPerhaps coverage through the Veterans Administration could be the first to be folded into Medicare. Many veterans are over 65, and all would be offered broader services.\nCovering all children under 16 could be next. Then high-expense procedures like transplants, as is done with dialysis. Then Medicaid recipients. Finally, allowing the remaining people -- relatively healthy, relatively affluent and overwhelmingly employed -- to use their current private insurance payments to buy into Medicare.\nCould that be the path?\nMichael P. Alexander, M.D. Newton Centre, Mass., Jan. 3, 2007\nThe writer is a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.\nTo the Editor:\nThank goodness for Paul Krugman's willingness to repeat his argument on behalf of us all.\nSadly, his appeal for significant and meaningful change has fallen on deaf ears.\nLegislators, not willing to confront a powerful middleman, are sitting by while lives, jobs, small businesses, international competitiveness and true freedom of choice in health care are mangled by an entity whose value to our overall health is questionable.\nCarol Salter Boulder, Colo., Jan. 1, 2007\nThe writer is a registered nurse.\nTo the Editor:\nPaul Krugman (column, Jan. 1) does not discuss a major reason we spend so much and get so little for our health care dollar.\nInsurance and pharmaceutical companies are publicly traded companies whose main goal is to make money. Their primary mission is not to provide health care coverage for their members; these are merely tools through which profits are generated.\nWhy do we delude ourselves in thinking that these companies would behave more altruistically than other companies? And why do we think these companies would relinquish these goals to help provide health care coverage for all?\nKenneth R. Silk, M.D. Ann Arbor, Mich., Jan. 1, 2007\nThe writer is a professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan Medical School.\nTo the Editor:\nIn thinking about Paul Krugman's review of the failed history of health reform, I am struck by the inherent irony.\nHere we are, more than a decade after being buffaloed by the ''Harry and Louise'' propaganda of the insurance industry, still watching the numbers of uninsured millions escalating, still worried about being at the mercies of the H.M.O.'s, and now hoping that ''big government'' will finally step in and help us out of this crazy system.\nYet, with all this, including the clamor to retain and even expand that big government program -- Medicare -- we still can't envision getting to where we need to be because of our cynicism and distrust of government!\nJohn Schlager Springfield, N.J., Jan. 1, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nPaul Krugman's appeal for universal health care is right on.\nWhile we suffer without the assurance of annual checkups, France, Canada, Scandinavia, Germany, Britain and others find it within their economic abilities to leave no person without annual medical exams and more.\nThe principal reason for our haplessness is, as Mr. Krugman wrote, the lobbying power of insurance businesses. Just why their intrusion into the equation is tolerated is beyond logic.\nI never saw an insurance agent cure so much as a hangnail.\nGil Weiss Stamford, Conn., Jan. 1, 2007

1816318	In Nod to Realpolitik, Offering Carrots To Both Sides	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404EFD81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Sure, some of Gov. Eliot Spitzer's calls in his first address to the Legislature on Wednesday -- for spending less money, ending gerrymandering and limiting campaign donations -- were met with the kind of icy reception he might have received if he had worn a Red Sox cap to Yankee Stadium.\nBut Mr. Spitzer, the new governor, also generously sprinkled his State of the State address with proposals that were clearly tailored to meet the needs and sensitivities of his politically divided audience, which will in large part determine his success or failure.\nMr. Spitzer, a Democrat, took pains to call for some proposals that are favored by the Democratic-led Assembly and others sought by the Republican-led State Senate in the hopes that by offering something to everyone, he would be able to push his agenda through both houses.\n''All New Yorkers ask is that when we address these problems, we reject the interest-group politics of division and fear,'' Mr. Spitzer said, ''and compromise enough to find consensus and listen enough to find solutions.''\nMr. Spitzer explicitly linked some proposals, like his call for more education spending, which Democrats cheered, with his call for a $6 billion property tax cut over three years, which brought Republican senators to their feet for an ovation. ''Because of the different needs of our state, as we provide more resources to school districts, we must provide more property tax relief to overtaxed homeowners,'' he said.\nHis education proposals offered something to each house as well: Mr. Spitzer called for making prekindergarten available to every 4-year-old in the state, long one of the Assembly's top priorities, by the end of his first term and for lifting the cap on charter schools, which the Senate tried to do last year. But his call for a ''new, transparent school funding formula'' was met with uneasy murmurs from some Republican senators, who jealously protect the current formula, which favors suburban districts.\nDemocrats applauded Mr. Spitzer's calls to insure the 500,000 children who lack health insurance, enroll the 900,000 adults who are eligible for Medicaid but not currently enrolled in it, and issue debt to pay for stem cell research. Republicans applauded his calls to make workers' compensation more affordable for businesses and to overhaul the Wicks Law, which requires school districts and others to hire at least four contractors for big construction jobs, a rule that many school officials say drives up building costs.\nOf course, in Albany, linking unrelated issues to one another is nothing new; many a legislative session has ended with negotiations on a raft of measures that get wrapped up in one huge deal, hatched behind closed doors, that is often referred to in the halls of the Capitol as a Big Ugly. And the danger of all-or-nothing negotiations in Albany is that nothing often winds up winning the day.\nBut the leaders of the Legislature, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, seemed determined on Wednesday to give the new governor a break, in the form of some kind words.\nMr. Silver, who in recent years had taken to lamenting what he called the ''wrong choices'' in Gov. George E. Pataki's addresses, found himself in the unusual position of praising a governor's speech -- effusively. Where he might once have expressed skepticism about a State of the State address that promised to increase education spending and insure the uninsured without raising taxes, Mr. Silver was all praise on Wednesday.\n''To the extent that all of the issues he outlined are resolvable by consensus, by taking all of the different views, and putting them together, there was very little I can disagree with,'' Mr. Silver said.\nMr. Silver even praised the way Mr. Spitzer had proposed some items that the Assembly had blocked in the past. Mr. Silver said, for instance, that he was glad that the governor had called for reforming the Wicks Law instead of repealing it. He also said that he was pleased that the governor's proposal to add more charter schools included a pledge for more aid to the school districts that would lose money if their students chose charter schools.\nAnd Senate Republicans were upbeat. Mr. Bruno said that there were enough measures laid out in the speech to please members of both houses -- even if each house might have to go along with some items it dislikes to get what it wants.\n''There are things to get things done that you have to kind of swallow hard on, but that's the business we're in,'' Mr. Bruno said. ''Now, what gridlock has been created in the past is because people were not willing to come together, openly, in a creative and imaginative way and compromise.''\nToughest, of course, will be the measures that touch lawmakers directly: the reform agenda. Asked about Mr. Spitzer's call for the full public financing of campaigns, Mr. Bruno said that he would support it for statewide positions but not for state lawmakers. And asked about the governor's call to end gerrymandering, Mr. Silver said only that the Assembly supported changing the current system, but did not say how.\nMr. Spitzer, who may have antagonized his somewhat subdued audience with his early references to Albany's problems and his proposals for change, seemed aware of the difficulty. When his call for the Legislature to analyze and report the fiscal impact of its budget amendments was met with stony silence, he teased the crowd a little.\n''You applaud for eliminating gerrymandering, but not for that?'' he asked.\nCHANGEOVER IN ALBANY: NEWS ANALYSIS

1816320	Nets Save About $5 Million by Trading McInnis to Bobcats	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DEED81730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Nets traded the disgruntled point guard Jeff McInnis to the Charlotte Bobcats yesterday for the swingman Bernard Robinson.\nThe Nets wanted to make the trade to unload McInnis's $3.6 million contract so they could move under the N.B.A.'s luxury-tax threshold. Teams must pay a dollar-for-dollar tax on any part of their payroll that exceeds $65.42 million. Those below the luxury tax level receive a rebate at the end of the season.\nThe trade is expected to save the Nets about $5 million. Robinson, 26, is making $1 million this season, but his salary did not have to match McInnis's because the Bobcats are below the salary cap. The Nets also sent an undisclosed amount of money to the Bobcats.\nThe Nets signed McInnis, 32, as a free agent before last season, but the relationship between player and team soon soured. McInnis became upset over his playing time early last season, and the situation worsened last January, when McInnis injured his knee and the Nets said they were unhappy with his work ethic during rehabilitation. ''He was not in top-flight condition when he was cleared to do basketball things,'' Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, said in an interview in October.\nMcInnis missed the final 48 games of last season, and the Nets asked him to stay away from the team for this entire season.\nMcInnis and his agent, Steve Kauffman, criticized the Nets at the start of this season, saying that the team's treatment and comments had diminished interest in McInnis around the league.\nThe Bobcats will be the seventh N.B.A. team for McInnis. He has had problems elsewhere, most notably in Cleveland, where he expressed his displeasure after losing his starting job to Eric Snow.\nMcInnis is a native of Charlotte, N.C., and he attended the University of North Carolina. ''He's thrilled,'' Kauffman said. ''He couldn't be happier. The main thing he's happy about is just to go out and play basketball again. It's especially good that it's Charlotte in this case.''\nThe Bobcats could be a good fit for McInnis because he is close with Bernie Bickerstaff, the team's head coach and general manager. While working with the front office in Denver, Bickerstaff drafted McInnis in 1996. He also coached McInnis in Washington during the 1998-99 season.\n''So I know the total Jeff McInnis,'' Bickerstaff said by telephone yesterday.\nCharlotte became interested in McInnis after its point guard, Brevin Knight, tore an abdominal muscle, an injury that is expected to keep him out for about a month. The Nets were originally interested in forward Melvin Ely, but the teams could not agree on a deal.\nRobinson, a third-year player, is expected to report to the Nets today.\nPRO BASKETBALL
1816321	Yanks Still Seek Help at First	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E7D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Yankees continued their attempt to trade Randy Johnson yesterday, talking with multiple teams about a deal. The most likely match remains Johnson's former team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, but Arizona has not been granted a 72-hour window to speak with him. Johnson must approve a trade and it is not clear how the Diamondbacks would afford him.\nWhile the Johnson talks have absorbed most of the Yankees' attention, they have other needs. They are still interested in signing a first baseman, with Travis Lee emerging as an option if they cannot agree to terms with Doug Mientkiewicz on a one-year deal.\nSigning Mientkiewicz is the Yankees' priority because of his exceptional glove and decent left-handed bat. Lee is also a left-hander and a strong defender, but he hit only .224 for Tampa Bay last season. He played briefly for the Yankees in 2004.\nMientkiewicz had back surgery last August after hitting .283 for Kansas City. He has discussed a one-year deal with the Yankees.\nThe Yankees already have two right-handers at first base in Andy Phillips and Josh Phelps, with only one expected to make the team. If they want to add another right-handed first baseman, they could still turn to the free agent Craig Wilson, who hit .212 in 40 games for the Yankees last season.\nFor now, the Yankees do not have a roster spot for Bernie Williams, the longtime center fielder, and they also need a backup infielder. They would also like another left-handed reliever to complement Mike Myers. They have signed the left-hander Ben Kozlowski, a minor leaguer, but have made no formal offers to veteran left-handers on the free-agent market.\nBASEBALL

1816323	Samsung to Unveil Large L.C.D. TVs	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E7D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Samsung, the world's largest seller of televisions, will introduce at next week's Consumer Electronics Show a new line of rear-projection L.C.D. televisions that will not be much thicker than flat-panel TVs but will cost about 30 percent less.\nThe new sets, aimed at those who want a bigger set but cannot afford a plasma TV, will come in 50- to 60-inch sizes. At 10 inches deep, they can be hung on a wall.\nWhile consumers are embracing L.C.D. flat-panel TVs in ever-larger sizes, Samsung has also recommitted itself to plasma TV and will double its current plasma production capacity later this year, said G. S. Choi, the company's president for digital media, in an interview from South Korea.\nPlasma will continue to dominate in larger sizes, and the company will add an 80-inch model to its lineup this year, Mr. Choi said. To help consumers fit these larger sizes in their homes, Samsung said it was redesigning the TV frames to make them up to 30 percent thinner.\nAt the electronics show, held annually in Las Vegas, Samsung will also introduce a wireless plasma TV that will be able to receive HDTV programming sent from an HD-DVD or Blu-ray player or set-top box. Because there will be no cables to hide, consumers may be more likely to hang such a plasma display on a wall.\nThe company, which was the first to introduce a Blu-ray high-definition DVD player last year, will announce its second-generation player next week. The new model is expected to cost about 20 percent less than the current version, but will have more interactive functions.\nAlthough LG will introduce a dual format HD-DVD/Blu-ray player, Samsung has no plans to do the same. ''If the market is still divided, we could do a dual-format player, but we will wait and see,'' Mr. Choi said.\nCorrection: January 5, 2007, Friday An article and a headline in some copies of Business Day yesterday about plans by Samsung to introduce new rear-projection televisions next week at the Consumer Electronics Show misstated the technology the TVs will employ. They will use digital light processing, or D.L.P. technology -- not liquid crystal display or L.C.D. technology.
1816324	Exxon Accused of Trying to Mislead Public	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE6D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Union of Concerned Scientists released a report on Wednesday accusing Exxon Mobil of spending millions of dollars to manipulate public opinion on the seriousness of global warming.\n''Many of the tactics, and even some of the same organizations and actors used by Exxon Mobil to mislead the public, draw upon the tobacco industry's 40-year disinformation campaign,'' the report said.\nThe report said that a task force that Exxon Mobil helped create on global climate science in 1998 included someone who had led a nonprofit organization called the Advancement of Sound Science Coalition, ''which had been covertly created by the tobacco company Philip Morris in 1993 to manufacture uncertainty about the health hazards posed by secondhand smoke.''\nMany of the accusations in the report have been made before by the scientists' organization and environmental groups. But the organization, a liberal advocacy group, said this report more completely detailed connections between money donated by Exxon Mobil and the scientists in groups that question the degree to which humans are contributing to climate change.\nThe release of the report comes as Democrats take control of Congress, and the organization said it hoped incoming committee chairmen investigate the links detailed in the report.\n''The relatively modest investment of about $16 million between 1998 and 2004 to select political organizations has been remarkably effective at manufacturing uncertainty about the scientific consensus on global warming,'' the report said.\nExxon Mobil released a statement responding to the report, saying ''many of the conclusions are inaccurate.'' It added, ''Our support extends to a fairly broad array of organizations that research significant domestic and foreign policy issues and promote discussion on issues of direct relevance to the company.''
1816325	Helping Make the Shift From Combat to Commerce	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E5D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Coming home from their respective tours of duty in Iraq, John Reid and Alina Gutierrez had never met but they had a lot in common. Both were sergeants in the 42nd Infantry Division of the Army and were deployed in Iraq from autumn 2004 to autumn 2005. And both had a strong interest in running their own businesses when they got home.\nMs. Gutierrez is an owner of a Glass Doctor franchise, and next month, Mr. Reid will open his own Glass Doctor in a neighboring New Jersey county. They are the beneficiaries of an innovative private-sector business plan aimed at encouraging and supporting military veterans.\nThe Veterans Transition Franchise Initiative, or VetFran, a program sponsored by the International Franchise Association, offers veterans a discount on financing prospective franchises as a way of thanking them for serving the country.\nNearly 200 participating franchise companies provide qualified veterans ''the best deal'' in acquiring a new franchise, a deal not available to other franchise investors, according to Dina Dwyer-Owens, president of the Dwyer Group, a franchise organization in Waco, Tex.\nFranchises have become an increasingly appealing route for many would-be entrepreneurs. According to a 2004 study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, franchise businesses employ more than 18 million Americans and generate more than $1.5 trillion, or nearly 10 percent of private-sector economic output. The study noted that there were more than 760,000 franchise businesses in the United States and franchising continues to be a fast-growing business opportunity.\nVetFran was conceived by Don Dwyer Sr., Ms. Dwyer-Owens' father, after the Persian Gulf war. When Mr. Dwyer died suddenly in 1994, the VetFran program foundered. After 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan, Ms. Dwyer-Owens decided that the program ought to be revived and, in 2002, she turned it over to the franchise association.\nVetFran is open to all veterans, not just those returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. Since the program began, more than 600 veterans have received discounts in starting franchise businesses. Among the participating franchise companies are Dunkin' Donuts, Midas, the UPS Store, Gold's Gym and Aamco Transmissions.\nMs. Gutierrez, 26, said she received a 10 percent discount on her Glass Doctor franchise fee, which saved her several thousand dollars in much-needed capital for her outlet in Mercer County. But as with Mr. Reid and other veterans who have participated in the VetFran program, the money was not as significant as the meaning of the gesture.\n''I was very excited when I heard about the program,'' Ms. Gutierrez said. ''When you come home from your deployment, you are not sure if everyone appreciated what you had done. I thought it was very cool that they recognized that we risked our lives in Iraq and they appreciated our sacrifice.''\nMr. Reid, who views Ms. Gutierrez as a colleague, not a competitor, said that the VetFran discount was a big influence on his decision to pursue a Glass Doctor franchise. ''The less capital you have to lay out, the better,'' he said. ''You need as much start-up money as you can get.''\nHe was also impressed that Glass Doctor, one of eight franchise businesses owned and operated by the Dwyer Group, was willing to be flexible with his deal, offering him an additional four months before he has to start repayments.\nBecause of their military training, returning veterans are highly regarded as prospective franchise operators by franchise companies. As with the military, successful franchises operate within a specific system and a set of guidelines, created by the franchiser.\n''Someone coming back from the military is a great fit for a franchise business,'' said Jim Blasingame, a small-business consultant and host of the ''The Small Business Advocate Show'' on radio. ''They not only know what it's like to work hard but they know how to operate within a system. With a franchise, you can't think outside the box. You have to color inside the lines.''\nThe military is apparently good training for all types of entrepreneurs. According to William D. Elmore, associate administrator for veterans business development at the Small Business Administration, there are 25 million veterans in the United States and one in seven of them is successfully self-employed.\n''Veterans have the highest rate of successful self-employment of any group of Americans,'' Mr. Elmore said, noting the 14 percent success rate in self-employment. He attributes this success to the discipline and training every soldier acquires during their service. ''There is an enormous resource going into the training and deployment of soldiers and out of that comes a skill set, discipline and worldliness that most citizens don't have at a young age.''\nMr. Reid, 40, says that Iraq gave him an opportunity to save $60,000 while he was deployed and he was intent on using that money to set up his own business. ''As a noncommissioned officer in charge of a logistics section, I was responsible for 45 people,'' he said. All 45 came back. ''So I thought, 'Let's see how I do in business.' ''\nHis Glass Doctor franchise in Somerset, N.J., which is set to open Feb. 5, gives him exclusive rights to all of Somerset County. ''They told me, 'We have a system. If you follow it, you'll be successful.' That sounded like the business for me,'' he said.\nThe VetFran program is allowing Brett Cooper to start a Lawn Doctor franchise in Boonville, Mo., while keeping his full-time job as a sales representative for Graybar Electric. As an 18-year member of the Missouri Army National Guard, Mr. Cooper was called up for a tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2004 and spent a year deployed in and around Kabul.\n''I looked into a Lawn Doctor franchise six years ago, but I wasn't financially able to do it,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''While I was in Afghanistan, I saved my salary. I'm a major so the pay was very good. and it gave me a cushion. I e-mailed Lawn Doctor from Afghanistan and was made aware of the VetFran program.''\nHe received a 5 percent discount on his start-up costs for the franchises, which is significant given that Lawn Doctor franchises cost $90,000.\nAs with other veterans starting franchises, Mr. Cooper does not hesitate to let customers know he is a veteran. ''I've absolutely used my veteran status,'' he said. ''People are very grateful that you have served your country, especially in the current conflict. Doing that kind of service for your country builds trust and respect.''\nMs. Dwyer-Owens is pleased by the response to the VetFran program thus far. ''The veterans are so grateful that we are there to say thanks,'' she said. ''I'm proud of it. There's no government funding. It's all done by private businesses.''\nMr. Elmore praised the VetFran program as a strong private-sector initiative that opened doors for veterans seeking small-business opportunities. He also cautioned that veterans should seek expert advice available through S.B.A. business development centers before signing any agreements (www.sba.gov/vets).\nJerry Pyle, a retired Marine sergeant in Mineola, Fla., is among those who appreciate the VetFran gesture. After a 22-year career in the Marines ended in 1999, Mr. Pyle tried his hand in corporate retail and found himself ill suited to that atmosphere. He began his own business as a handyman and home remodeler and when he moved from South Carolina to central Florida, he heard about the Dream Maker Bath and Kitchen Worldwide franchise, another Dwyer Group company.\n''It resonated with me that a corporation would actually take my service to the country into consideration,'' he said. ''It felt like a belated payback for 22 years of service.''\nThe VetFran program emphasizes that veterans not only make excellent franchisers but employees as well. Mr. Pyle said that he gravitated toward the qualities and values of veterans and all of his five full-time employees are either veterans or wives of veterans. ''Their qualities of teamwork, ethics and enthusiasm make us a better company,'' he said.\nSMALL BUSINESS
1816326	Despite Misgivings, White House Says Little Against Hanging	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E5D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The White House declined Wednesday to criticize the conduct of the execution of Saddam Hussein, even as State Department officials and military leaders in Baghdad raised questions about the timing of the hanging and the way the condemned dictator was taunted by Shiite guards as he stood on the gallows.\nSpokesmen for President Bush said he had not seen the video of the execution Saturday, and Mr. Bush himself refused to answer questions about it. Appearing in the Rose Garden with his cabinet to talk about a balanced budget, the president turned his back and walked away when a reporter called out to ask whether he believed that the hanging had been handled appropriately.\nThe circumstances surrounding the hanging have prompted public demonstrations among Mr. Hussein's Sunni loyalists in Iraq and outrage around the world. Yet, while Bush administration officials said in quiet background conversations that they agreed that the execution was bungled, the White House insisted in public on Wednesday that the president was concentrating on the future of Iraq and that he was content to leave the investigation to the Iraqis.\n''The most important thing to keep in mind is, this is a guy who killed hundreds of thousands of people and received justice,'' said Tony Snow, the White House press secretary. Mr. Snow said too much attention had been paid to ''the last two minutes'' of Mr. Hussein's life and not enough to the previous 69 years.\nWith Mr. Bush set to make a major speech, possibly as soon as next week, outlining a new strategy in Iraq, the handling of the execution has put the White House in a difficult position. The president in November proclaimed Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki ''the right guy for Iraq.'' Now Mr. Maliki faces international criticism for his decision to press ahead with the hanging, and questions about whether he is as committed as Mr. Bush to reconciling sectarian differences in Iraq.\nThe execution was carried out at the onset of a major Islamic festival that began on Saturday for Sunnis and on Sunday for Shiites. Mr. Hussein was subjected to mockery and cries of ''Moktada!'' -- a reference to Moktada al-Sadr, the Shiite cleric whose militia has been responsible for attacks against Sunnis.\n''It really was disappointing to see that they didn't have better control over the execution, so that you wouldn't have had that scene, with the demonstration from Moktada's supporters,'' said a senior administration official in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity, to avoid the appearance of interfering in Iraq's sovereign affairs.\nBut another official said that the White House had decided the execution did not ''rise to the level of a presidential comment'' and that it was best to let other parts of the administration do the talking.\nIn Baghdad, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the top American military spokesman, conceded that the United States would have handled the execution differently, but said that the final decisions were up to the Iraqi government.\nThe State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said that American officials had raised questions last week about the timing of the hanging, but that the execution had been warranted as the result of what he called a ''very solid'' judicial proceeding. He acknowledged that television images of Mr. Hussein being taunted at the gallows could further inflame tensions. ''This happened,'' he said. ''It wasn't supposed to have happened, but it happened.''\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ
1816327	From Hussein, a Florid Farewell to the Iraqi People	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E5D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The dictator sat alone in his cell, three years in American custody. His beard had gone gray, his sons were dead and the gallows were being readied.\nSaddam Hussein in those final days turned to poetry, so often his source of solace in times of difficulty, inspired by his vision of himself as inseparably tied to those he led.\nThe poem, ''Unbind It,'' is his rallying call to be sounded from the grave.\nIt is a mixture of defiance and reflection, but no remorse. No mention of the tens of thousands of lives he was responsible for taking. No expression of guilt or sadness or regret.\nThe poem, flush with florid phrases that were his trademark, begins with what sounds like a paean to the love between himself and his people, who were about to lose him.\nUnbind your soul. It is my soul mate and you are my soul's beloved.\nNo house could have sheltered my heart as you have.\nHe moves quickly to more aggressive language. He refers to the foreigners who swept him from power and to the Iraqis who rose to rule here in his place.\nThe enemies forced strangers into our sea\nAnd he who serves them will be made to weep.\nHere we unveil our chests to the wolves\nAnd will not tremble before the beast.\nThe verses were written by Mr. Hussein after he was sentenced to death and, according to his relatives, are believed to be his last written words.\nA handwritten copy of the poem was passed along by the Iraqi authorities to his family in Tikrit, along with his final will and testament, according to Mr. Hussein's cousin Muayed Dhamin al-Hazza.\nMr. Hazza read the poem on the telephone, saying he hoped Mr. Hussein's farewell would underline the manner in which the execution was carried out.\nIraqi and American officials confirmed that a poem left among Mr. Hussein's belongings at the American military detention center was delivered to his family.\nIn the poem, Mr. Hussein praises those who continue to fight for the Iraqi nation and condemns the ''wolves'' who have brought ruin through their invasion. He portrays himself as a martyr.\nHis poetry, like his speeches at decisive moments of his dictatorship, was often obscure, highly alliterative and difficult, even for Arabic speakers, to comprehend fully.\nAt the height of his power, Iraqis brave enough to discuss the subject would shake their heads at his rambling speeches and convoluted verse. Some would suggest, with glances over their shoulders, that in his efforts to show himself as a scholar of Arab history and literature, he inadvertently revealed some of the darker recesses of his mind.\nAccording to news reports, Mr. Hussein even made gifts of his poetry to his American captors.\nIraqis familiar with his style helped translate his death cell poem. Sections that would have been unintelligible in a literal translation have been interpreted loosely in an attempt to reveal the meaning Mr. Hussein intended.\nHe is most clear when talking about how he sees himself in light of his impending death.\nI sacrifice my soul for you and for our nation\nBlood is cheap in hard times.\nMr. Hussein told his official biographer that he cared little what people thought of him when he was alive, but that he hoped to be revered as one of the giants of history -- as a Nebuchadnezzar or Saladin -- 500 years from now.\nHe ordered that one in every 10 bricks used in reconstructing the ancient palace at Babylon be stamped with his name or an eight-pointed star to symbolize the eight letters in his name in the Arabic alphabet.\nFor a man whose vanity was in proportion to his brutality, he appears, from the poem, to have seen himself as dying for a greater good. It was a theme he returned to repeatedly in the courtroom where he was condemned to death for crimes against humanity, telling the judges that he was speaking to history.\nMany Iraqis viewed the thousands of portraits of Mr. Hussein erected around the country -- in business suits, as warrior, as Arab sheik -- as a sort of guidebook to his illusions about himself. Even as his secret police murdered tens of thousands, he sealed himself off with the conviction that he was widely loved.\nOne of his favorite books was ''The Old Man and the Sea,'' but his style could not be mistaken for Hemingway. No short crisp sentences for Mr. Hussein.\nWhile still in power, he wrote, at least in part, two romantic novels. ''Zabibah and the King,'' which is set in a fanciful Arabia of long ago, tells of a lonely king who, while powerful, feels cut off from his liegemen. He encounters Zabibah and is entranced by her beauty and wisdom. But outsiders soon invade the kingdom, which is described as the cradle of civilization, and Zabibah is raped -- on Jan. 17, a reference to the beginning of the Persian Gulf war of 1991.\nWhen the book was released, Central Intelligence Agency analysts reportedly pored over it searching for clues into Mr. Hussein's mind.\nBut they could just as easily have turned to ''The Old Man and the Sea,'' which Mr. Hussein had first read as a young man in a different prison: ''A man can be destroyed not defeated.''\nIn that spirit, he urges his followers to be fierce and noble, saying:\nWe never kneel or bend when attacking\nBut we even treat our enemy with honor.\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ

1816330	Studies Find Harm in 2 Parkinson's Drugs	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E3D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Two drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease and other disorders can seriously damage heart valves, researchers are reporting.\nThe drugs are pergolide, sold as Permax, and cabergoline, sold as Dostinex. Permax is approved in the United States and overseas for Parkinson's. Dostinex is used for Parkinson's in other countries but is approved in this country only for a hormonal disorder, hyperprolactinemia.\nNew findings on the drugs are described in two studies being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine.\nPermax already carries a black-box warning label -- the strongest warning required by the Food and Drug Administration -- about an increased risk of heart-valve problems. Such warnings, bordered in black, appear at the top of prescribing information to get doctors' attention. The Permax warning was added in 2003, based on a small number of reported cases. It includes this statement: ''Some patients have required valve replacement, and deaths have been reported.''\nA milder warning about valve problems was added to Dostinex just last month. It is identified as a ''precaution,'' which means there is no black box, and the advice is in a less obvious part of the prescribing information for doctors.\nA spokeswoman for the drug agency said that it had worked with the makers of both drugs on the labeling changes, but that she did not know whether the new findings would lead to further changes.\nDr. Michael S. Okun, the medical director for the National Parkinson Foundation, said people taking Permax or Dostinex for Parkinson's should be told about the new information and given a chance to switch to other drugs. He added that patients who were just starting treatment should be given other drugs. Safer, equally effective drugs are available, he said.\nDr. Okun, who was not involved in the two studies, is also co-director of the Parkinson Disease and movement disorders center at the University of Florida in Gainesville.\nHe said doctors in poorer countries might favor Permax and Dostinex because they are cheaper than some other Parkinson's drugs. But Dr. Okun said it would cost no more to switch patients to the old Parkinson's standby drug, L-dopa or levodopa, which has side effects of its own, but has never been known to damage heart valves.\n''Patients should be given the choice of what to do,'' Dr. Okun said. ''There are lots of people worldwide who have used these drugs successfully. Some patients, after being educated, may decide they want to accept the potential risk. Others may want to switch.''\nAnother researcher took a far different view.\n''I would just recommend not prescribing these drugs,'' said that researcher, Dr. Bryan L. Roth, who wrote an analysis of the research that accompanied the articles in The Journal. Dr. Roth is a professor of pharmacology and medicinal chemistry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and director of the psychoactive drug screening program at the National Institute of Mental Health.\nDr. Roth called the risk of valve disease ''extraordinarily high'' and asked: ''Why would you want to subject your patient to this kind of risk? I wouldn't.''\nValeant Pharmaceuticals, which makes Permax, issued a statement by e-mail calling the drug safe and effective for Parkinson's. But Valeant added that it no longer promoted the drug, which was originally made by Eli Lilly.\nDr. Michael Berelowitz, senior vice president of Pfizer, which makes Dostinex, said the company had received fewer than 100 reports of valve problems from the drug, mostly in people with Parkinson's.\nThe two new reports involve only Parkinson's. The results should not be applied to patients who take Dostinex for the hormone disorder because they take far smaller doses of the drug than do patients with Parkinson's, said Dr. David L. Kleinberg, a professor of medicine and director of the neuroendocrine unit at New York University's medical school.\nThe hormone disorder affects tens of thousands of people in the United States, mostly women, said Dr. Shlomo Melmed, an endocrinologist and a senior vice president of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Men can develop the disorder, and some need higher doses of Dostinex than do women, Dr. Melmed said, so those men should be monitored for heart valve problems.\nNeither drug is a big seller. About 73,000 prescriptions were written for Permax last year, representing $10.5 million in the billion-dollar market for Parkinson's drugs in the United States, according to IMS Health, which tracks drug sales.\nAbout 1.5 million Americans have Parkinson's, according to the National Parkinson Foundation. Dostinex sales in the United States totaled about $88 million in 2005, and about 87,000 prescriptions were written, according to Wolters Kluwer Health, an information company in the Netherlands.\nThe two new studies are larger than previous ones, and they confirm the higher risk of valve damage in people taking either drug for Parkinson's. The studies also find that the valve problem is more common than initially thought, and that people who took the highest doses for the longest time had the greatest risk.\nOne study, from the Istituti Clinici di Perfezionamento in Milan, included 155 patients with Parkinson's and found that 23 percent of those taking Permax and 29 percent of those taking Dostinex had damaged heart valves, compared with only almost 6 percent of control subjects not taking the drugs.\nThe other study, based on the records of more than 11,000 patients with Parkinson's in Britain, found that valve problems were seven times as likely in people taking Permax as in control subjects and five times as likely in those taking Dostinex.\nDr. Roth said the drugs produced the same kind of valve damage caused by the weight loss combination fen-phen, which led to the withdrawal of two drugs, Pondimin and Redux, in 1997.

1816331	Town Considers Guards for Library Disrupted by Students	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E2D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Maplewood Township Committee is asking the public library's board of trustees not to follow through with a plan to close its two buildings during after-school hours and is considering providing security guards to help quell disruptive behavior, Mayor Fred R. Profeta Jr. said Wednesday.\nThe trustees voted last month to close Maplewood Memorial Library weekdays from 2:45 to 5 p.m., citing an influx of students from the nearby middle school, some of whom have been disruptive.\nThe committee discussed a plan late Tuesday night to provide the library with security guards.\n''The township will pay for that, because it's a public safety issue, though it may go through the library budget,'' Mr. Profeta said in an interview.\nPolice Chief Robert Cimino said that the department was checking references for several security companies, and that guards could be hired within the next month, at a cost of $280 to $700 a week per guard. Plans call for two guards, he said.\nThe mayor said he would petition the library board to rescind its initial decision before the planned closing on Jan. 16.\n''I think the closure's a very bad idea,'' the mayor said. ''I think that it was not warranted, because a lot of the programs we have in the works are designed -- and well designed -- to alleviate the situation. We just have to put those in place.''\nBut David Huemer, who represents the Maplewood Township Committee on the library board, said the library had already indicated that a plan for guards was not enough to rescind its vote on the closing.\nThe council is also considering an expansion of a youth program at the Morrow Memorial United Methodist Church, which now operates on Wednesdays. The mayor said $10,000 in private money could be readily used for the expansion, but did not identify its source.\nOne middle school program is run in the library basement by the recreation committees of Maplewood and South Orange, and the local Y.M.C.A. provides after-school activities every day for $145 a month, but only 29 of its 51 available spots are filled.\n''It's very difficult to monitor 700-plus students once they leave our building,'' said Kristopher Harrison, the principal of Maplewood Middle School, adding that he hoped for an alternative soon. ''Then we could use this disappointing situation and make something very positive for the students,'' he said.
1816332	SPITZER REQUESTS SWEEPING ARRAY OF NEW MEASURES	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed overhauling almost every corner of the state's operations and policies in his first address to the Legislature on Wednesday. He said he would move swiftly to guarantee health insurance for all children in the state, toughen campaign finance laws, cut property taxes by $6 billion and draft constitutional amendments to overhaul the state's courts.\nThe dizzying collection of ambitious proposals reflects how the new governor is moving quickly to capitalize on the momentum of his landslide victory and recent government corruption scandals to push through major initiatives early in his term. While some of the proposals were outlined during his campaign, in his speech to lawmakers he offered several new initiatives and promised to accomplish others during his first year in office.\n''Make no mistake, the changes I just described will not be easy, but change rarely is,'' he said near the end of the speech, in which he used the words ''reform'' or ''reforms'' 31 times. ''At every major transition point in our history, we have experienced uncertainty and growing pains. We will experience them again.''\nIn an hourlong address that was largely a repudiation of the policies of his predecessor, George E. Pataki, the new governor said he would seek to broadly overhaul the state's ethics and lobbying rules. He said he would make prekindergarten available to all 4-year-olds by the end of his term, overhaul the public authorities that control most of the state's debt and make New York more inviting to business by reducing the cost of workers' compensation.\nThe speech came two days after his inaugural address, in which he laid out the broad themes of his administration. Wednesday's speech, by contrast, included the outlines of the specific proposals that he hopes to accomplish in the year ahead and in his first term, as he appealed directly to lawmakers.\nDuring the speech, lawmakers responded with varying degrees of applause, cheers and silence as the list of proposals ticked past -- with Mr. Spitzer once jokingly encouraging them to show more enthusiasm.\nThe two legislative leaders who have ruled the state for the last decade alongside Mr. Pataki generally embraced the speech afterward.\n''This is our agenda,'' said the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, the state's top Republican. ''Tax cuts, no new taxes, job creation, education, health care for everyone, reform.''\nAssembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, long used to being Mr. Pataki's Democratic foil, responded with relief.\n''For the last 12 years, we have witnessed what happens when the two-party system becomes the too-petty system,'' Mr. Silver said, adding that there was ''very little I can disagree with'' in the governor's speech.\nBut there is no shortage of questions, including how Mr. Spitzer will find the money for all his proposals -- an elixir of promises to decrease spending growth over all but, at the same time, spend billions more on school aid and to insure the state's roughly half a million uninsured children while also providing $6 billion in additional property tax relief over the next three years.\nMr. Spitzer's plan to rein in health care spending, the largest part of the budget, is politically risky; it is likely to alienate the state's powerful health care unions and lobbyists. Among his proposals are broad changes in the state's Medicaid and health care policies, including carrying out a plan, formulated last year, to reduce the hospitals in the state by about 20. He would also shift ''spending away from expensive institutional nursing homes toward community and home-based alternatives.''\nHe pledged to bring transparency to the state's inscrutable formula for doling out school aid, and he said revitalizing the economy of upstate New York would be a top priority. He called the rebuilding effort at ground zero ''a monument to government gridlock'' and said he would move swiftly to reassess the program. He said he would propose legislation to create a nonpartisan redistricting commission and veto ''any proposal that reflects partisan gerrymandering.'' And he said he would seek to eventually have campaigns for state office publicly financed.\nMr. Spitzer's proposals are at the mercy of lawmakers who benefit from the current system, which practically guarantees them re-election. But the new governor may capitalize on cries for reform in a capital spurred by the investigation, indictment or conviction of at least 10 state lawmakers in recent years.\nAnd just as Mr. Pataki was able to push through tax cuts and the death penalty in his first year in office, lawmakers may be inclined to support many of the Spitzer proposals given his huge election victory.\nBut some proposals would face other formidable obstacles. In his pledge to address longstanding problems with the state court system, his remedies would require amending the State Constitution, a process that involves approval in two consecutive legislative sessions and then direct ratification by voters.\nHe said he would submit two constitutional amendments, one of which would tackle the state's court system, which has been described as one of the most complex in the country. In New York, criminal cases are handled by a variety of courts, while lawsuits against the state have a special court of their own. Divorces are heard in the state's Supreme Courts, which are the highest trial courts, but child custody and support cases are often heard in Family Court.\nThe second constitutional amendment would allow for the appointment of judges based on merit, which Mr. Spitzer said ''will take the politics out of the selection of judges.'' Most judges in the state are now elected, a process that critics say has been tarnished by a spate of scandals involving unqualified or politically connected judges.\nHis ethics reforms echoed pledges made during the campaign, but they have been given more immediacy by the recent spate of scandals. He said he would move within weeks to introduce ''a reform package to replace the weakest campaign finance laws in the nation with the strongest.''\nThe package will include drastically lowering campaign contribution limits, closing loopholes that allow individuals to evade those limits easily, and to ''sharply reduce contributions from lobbyists and companies that do business with the state.''\nAfter ethics, he said ''our second major challenge'' would be ''the revitalization of our economy in a rapidly changing world,'' and he gave particular emphasis to reviving the battered economy of upstate New York.\nThat was endorsed even by New York's mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg. ''His focus in particular on helping upstate -- where we have had population declines and where education has been falling behind the curve and the economy has been slow or even worse -- that's exactly what this state needs,'' Mr. Bloomberg said after the speech. ''And Eliot Spitzer's going to do a great job.''\nMr. Spitzer also called for using new state debt to support research into stem cells and other advanced sciences, a proposal that could be resisted in the Republican-led Senate.\nAmong his transportation initiatives, he called for expediting a new Peace Bridge, which connects western New York and Canada over the Niagara River at Buffalo. Downstate, he called for building the ''first segment of the Second Avenue subway'' and planning ''for the full extension to Lower Manhattan.'' He also called for finishing the plan to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge and enlarge Stewart Airport in the Hudson Valley ''to become the fourth major airport'' downstate.\nMuch of the fine print of the governor's proposals will have to wait until the end of the month, when Mr. Spitzer unveils his first executive budget. But even members of his own party are preparing for upheaval.\n''Some of the things are tough, but as I told my colleagues, it's been pretty easy around here,'' said the Senate minority leader, Malcolm A. Smith, a Queens Democrat. ''Now you have to step up, and you're going to have to buckle down a little bit, and do the work that the people voted you to be doing.''\nCHANGEOVER IN ALBANY
1816333	Garry Betty, 49, Chief of the Internet Provider EarthLink	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E2D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Garry Betty, who built the EarthLink Corporation from a struggling start-up into a public company that took on telecommunications giants, died Tuesday in Atlanta. He was 49.\nThe cause was heart problems associated with adrenal cortical cancer, said Scott Hobby, a business associate and close family friend.\nAt his death, Mr. Betty was EarthLink's chief executive, though he had given up his daily duties to pursue medical treatment.\nCharles Garry Betty was born in Huntsville, Ala., and reared in Columbus, Ga. He worked his way through the Georgia Institute of Technology with jobs that included selling house siding over the phone. He graduated in 1979 with a degree in chemical engineering.\nHe worked briefly at Procter & Gamble and I.B.M., and in 1984 became vice president for sales and marketing at Hayes Microcomputer Products, which made computer modems.\nIn 1989, Mr. Betty was named president of Digital Communications Associates, which made technology to let personal computers talk to mainframe computers. A year later, at the age of 33, Mr. Betty became chief executive of the company.\nIn 1996, Sky Dayton, the founder of EarthLink, an Internet access company, persuaded Mr. Betty to become chief executive, working in Pasadena, Calif., and returning to his home in Atlanta on weekends.\nAt the time, EarthLink was adding subscribers at a furious pace, growing 10 percent to 15 percent every week, but was functionally bankrupt, Mr. Betty said last August.\nThe company borrowed money and, in January 1997, became one of the first Internet companies to go public, a few months before Amazon.com. It built a reputation for customer service and became known as a consumer-friendly alternative to America Online.\n''I built the plane, but he was the pilot,'' Mr. Dayton said of Mr. Betty yesterday. ''He was at once a very strait-laced conservative Southern gentleman who also devoured fantasy books. There were a lot of dimensions to him.''\nIn recent years, EarthLink has faced considerable challenges as consumers abandon dial-up Internet access, the company's bread and butter, in favor of broadband access. Mr. Betty pushed the company into new businesses, like offering citywide wireless networks and investing in Helio, a venture with SK Telecom, which provides mobile phone service aimed at young consumers.\nMr. Betty and Mr. Hobby had been working together to create a foundation in Mr. Betty's name that would focus on using adult stem cells to search for cancer cures.\nMr. Betty is survived by his wife, Kathy Betty, and a sister, Rena Lane.\nAnother passion of Mr. Betty's was books. He owned 3,500 first editions and first printings, many of them science fiction and fantasy, and about 10,000 pulp magazines.\nIn an interview a few months ago, he said he loved stories where ''good triumphs over evil.''
1816334	Bush Reaches Out, but Keeps One Hand on the Wheel	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E2D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	In an article published on a friendly op-ed page, and from the regal confines of the White House, President Bush greeted the incoming Democratic leadership of Congress on Wednesday with a message of bipartisanship.\nBut he also sent another message: I'm still the guy with the big plane, the big office (the oval one) and the presidential seal.\nWith the op-ed, in The Wall Street Journal, and in the Rose Garden appearance, Mr. Bush sought to set the governing agenda one day before Democrats were officially to take control of Congress and alter the balance of power that has favored Mr. Bush's party for nearly his entire presidency.\nIn doing so, Mr. Bush mixed calls for unity in governing with a series of red flags on his signature issues.\nTax increases? Forget it.\n''The elections have not reversed the laws of economics,'' Mr. Bush wrote in The Journal. ''It is a fact that economies do best when you reward hard work by allowing people to keep more of what they have earned.''\nThe war in Iraq? ''We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus to fight and win the war,'' he wrote. In other words, we're staying.\nThat new Democratic majority? It isn't really so big.\n''The minority party, especially where the margins are close,'' Mr. Bush wrote, ''has a strong say in the form bills take.'' And the president, he added -- lest anyone forget -- has the constitutional authority ''to use his judgment whether they should be signed into law.''\nSeveral Democrats said Mr. Bush's words on Wednesday had raised questions about what kind of president would show up when they get down to the business of governing side by side.\nSome Democrats may have hoped it would be the George W. Bush who contritely acknowledged a ''thumpin' '' for his party the day after the elections in November. But the evidence suggests it is more likely to be the man who all but ignored the disputed circumstances of his election in 2000, governed from then as if he had an expansive mandate and who -- even as he has employed soothing tones in speaking to and about Democrats for the last two months -- has gradually but firmly reasserted himself on both foreign and domestic policy.\n''I think what the op-ed showed was the fundamental division within the White House and probably within the president's head whether to stick to the old issues and just talk bipartisanship versus really doing it,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the new vice chairman of the Democratic caucus in the Senate, in an interview.\nThe first few weeks of January are traditionally when the White House carefully rolls out new or repackaged policy initiatives before the president's State of the Union address, a period when he can set the agenda. But for the first time since early 2002, when Democrats controlled the Senate, Mr. Bush has to share power and the national microphone. He also has to show that he has a domestic agenda at a time when his presidency is largely consumed by Iraq.\nBoth sides were making some effort on Wednesday to play nice. White House officials noted that the president had highlighted several areas in which he has shown a willingness to work more closely with Democrats, like on a new minimum wage and a new immigration law.\nAnd the White House arranged for a plane to bring the incoming Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, back to Washington from Gerald R. Ford's funeral in Grand Rapids, Mich., in time for a reception with Mr. Bush and the other Congressional leaders.\nIn a memorandum that Mr. Reid issued Wednesday to fellow Democrats, he wrote, ''I'm encouraged that President Bush said today that he wants to work in bipartisanship.''\nBut, he added, ''I hope he means it.'' And in defining his own approach to bipartisanship, Mr. Reid went on to praise Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, saying Mr. Smith's commentary last month on the administration's war policy -- in which Mr. Smith said it ''may even be criminal'' -- had ''signaled a sea change over how Congress will address the Iraq war.''\nMr. Reid promised to work with Republicans to ''bring oversight and accountability to the Bush administration's conduct of the war and ensure a new policy that meets conditions on the ground'' but also ''allows our troops to come home.''\nDemocrats were moving quickly to hold the administration accountable, in their view, for its mistakes, promising to hold as many as a dozen oversight hearings on the war alone in the next few weeks.\nIn interviews, White House officials did not hesitate to acknowledge that they were taking advantage of the last day before the Democrats take control to assert some presidential power.\nNor did they dispute Democrats' suspicions that the White House placed Mr. Bush's opinion piece in The Journal to reassure a target audience of nervous fiscal conservatives -- and the financial markets -- that he remained philosophically opposed to any tax increases.\nBut administration officials disputed Democratic assertions that the president was trying to upstage them before their big day.\n''It's an appropriate time to say where we are on these things and to again reiterate the president's view that we can work together to find common ground,'' said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman. ''It also doesn't mean that a Democrat-controlled Congress passes whatever they want and we sign it -- that's not bipartisanship.''\nBut it was clear that as both sides spoke about bipartisanship, they were defining it on different terms.\nMr. Fratto acknowledged as much, saying, ''We'll have to see as we go forward over the next six months, in particular, if everyone has the same understanding of what bipartisanship means.''\nTHE 110TH CONGRESS: WHITE HOUSE MEMO
1816335	Defense May Be Ultimate Measure of Colts' Success	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E2D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Running backs have relished playing against the Indianapolis Colts.\nThe Colts allowed more rushing yards (173 a game) by far than any team in the National Football League during the regular season. Star running backs hurt them. Journeyman running backs hurt them. In an embarrassing 44-17 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Colts yielded 375 yards on the ground as Maurice Jones-Drew (166 yards) and Fred Taylor (131 yards) had their choice of which gaping hole to run through.\nNo wonder Coach Tony Dungy closed practice to reporters this week for the first time all season. The Colts face a potential nightmare Saturday, trying to contain the running back Larry Johnson in their American Football Conference playoff opener at home against the Kansas City Chiefs. Johnson is the kind of gifted, durable running back who can run Indianapolis right out of the playoffs.\n''If I was on the other team, and I watched the game, I would say the same thing, 'Oh, yeah, we can run on the Colts,' '' Colts defensive end Dwight Freeney said before Wednesday's practice. ''It's up to us to step up to the plate, to answer all those critics out there.''\nIt speaks volumes for the offense, led by Peyton Manning, that the team finished 12-4. Indianapolis gave up almost 30 more yards rushing a game than the league's next worst team, the St. Louis Rams (145.4 yards). And the Colts did not face the league's three leading rushers -- LaDainian Tomlinson of San Diego, Johnson and Frank Gore of San Francisco.\nIs one week enough time for the Colts' run defense to improve dramatically? Dungy hopes so. The Colts were not bad every week against the run, but they were extremely schizophrenic.\nThe week after the Jacksonville loss, Indianapolis held Cincinnati to 133 yards in 30 attempts during a 34-16 victory. But the next week against Houston, the former Giants and Denver Broncos castoff Ron Dayne punished Indianapolis for 153 yards on 32 carries, as the Texans won, 27-24.\nDungy is a defensive coach at heart, and he admitted his team's unreliable defense troubled him.\n''We've had flashes of it, but we have not been consistent all year and that's a little disappointing,'' Dungy said. ''I know we have the ability to do it, and we've done it in stretches of games.\n''We've got to put it together week in and week out if we want to do anything in the playoffs.''\nIndianapolis is hoping to get a lift from the former Pro Bowl safety Bob Sanders, who expects to play against the Chiefs after missing most of the season with a knee injury. Sanders's sure tackling and aggressiveness bolsters the Colts' run defense.\n''He's got a lot of speed, and he's a good hitter,'' Dungy said. ''More than anything, he probably brings an energy to us, because he's an excitable player, he's an emotional player. I think it's going to definitely give us a lift having him back.''\nBut Dungy may have closed practice because he was planning some personnel changes and different defensive looks.\n''I'll probably keep that to myself,'' Dungy said, smiling.\nDungy may need some special defensive tactics because Johnson is no ordinary running back. Only Tomlinson (1,819 yards) rushed for more yards than Johnson (1,789), and Johnson had 11 games in which he rushed for at least 100 yards, including six of the last seven, while setting a league record with 416 carries for the season. Kansas City figures to continue to make Johnson the focal point of the offense, hoping to wear down the Colts' defense while keeping Manning off the field.\n''You don't want to give them the ball,'' Chiefs Coach Herman Edwards said Wednesday during a conference call with reporters. ''Against them, that's your whole mind-set. If we don't make first downs and control this clock, most defenses aren't going to be able to slow them down.''\nThis is the Colts' fifth consecutive year in the playoffs, and while Manning has been criticized for not leading his team to the Super Bowl, it will be difficult for Indianapolis to win a championship without improved play from its defense.\nWhen Dungy coached at Tampa Bay, defense was the team's staple, but he has grown accustomed to coaching a team with an offensive personality.\n''When we're able to shut people down and give the ball back to our offense, I feel more comfortable,'' Dungy said. ''You have to build around what you have, and there's a lot of ways to win.\n''The ideal situation would be to be dominant on both sides of the ball. But for me, with my background growing up in the N.F.L. on defense, you always feel like you want to shut people down.''\nFor the Colts, the first challenge is to shut down Johnson. How successful they are at that task will help determine if their season extends beyond Saturday.\n''We don't have to come up with a new elaborate game plan,'' Freeney said. ''We just need to do what we do, and make plays. Whatever it takes, it's about moving on to next week.''\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816336	Jets' Kendall Shows He's Not Afraid to Talk One for the Team	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E2D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Pete Kendall strolled out of the training room Monday clutching a three-week-old U.S. News & World Report magazine.\nKendall, the avuncular veteran on the Jets' offensive line, is considered a sort of Tony Snow in sweats; he has a wry sense of humor and will speak for his tight-lipped bosses and his skittish peers. So, naturally, he was surrounded by reporters as soon as he arrived at his locker.\nWith unfailing politeness, the 33-year-old Kendall answered every question pertaining to the Jets' game Sunday afternoon in New England. Because it was Monday afternoon, he kept stealing glances at the nearest clock.\nFive and a half days a week, Kendall, a left guard, works with the rookies on the line, teaching center Nick Mangold and left tackle D'Brickashaw Ferguson the tricks of the trade. Mangold, who has started all 16 games and missed only one snap this season, said that Kendall has been a prince of a mentor. ''I can't say enough about what Pete has done for me,'' Mangold said.\nFerguson, who had a solid regular season, also praised Kendall. ''I can ask him for help on anything,'' he said.\nKendall's tutorials wind down Monday afternoon and resume on Wednesday morning. Tuesdays are reserved for his children, which is why almost every Monday since September he has commuted seven hours round trip from Long Island to Weymouth, Mass., where his wife, Michelle, lives with the couple's three children -- Peter, 8, Madison, 7, and Andrew, 5.\nHe is always watching the clock on getaway day, but Kendall is too much of a professional to execute a false start. The first Monday of the postseason was typical for Kendall, who stuck around until the last wave of reporters had receded, knowing that every extra minute he spent in the locker room could add 10 minutes to his drive because of traffic.\nIf Kendall was lucky, he would still arrive home in time to tuck his children into bed. ''It's hard not being able at least to tuck them in every night and tell them I love them,'' said Kendall, who has numerous pictures of his children lining his locker. ''We try to make the most of it. Really, when you look at the big picture, it's not a bad picture. It just involves a little sacrifice.''\nKendall never intended to be a one-day-a-week father for a good chunk of the year. When he was signed by the Jets in 2004 after he was let go by Arizona, Kendall's plan was for his family to live with him on Long Island.\nTwice last season they nearly purchased a home in the area, only to have the deals fall through.\nThey were prepared to try again this season. But during the off-season, the Jets released their 35-year-old center, Kevin Mawae, and asked Kendall, their next oldest lineman, to restructure his contract. At that point, he felt his N.F.L. career might be nearing an end.\n''I just said, you know, who am I kidding?'' Kendall said. ''I'm probably a serious injury away from a coat and tie. My wife and I talked about it and it didn't make a lot of sense to pack the kids up. We just felt like for their development, the most practical and pragmatic thing was to allow them to start to put down some roots.''\nKendall's New England roots run as deep as a maple tree's. He was born in Weymouth and was named the New England high school player of the year as a senior at Archbishop Williams High School.\nHe turned down a chance to play football at Notre Dame to attend Boston College, saying Wednesday that staying close to home was a major factor in his decision. Growing up, he was a huge fan of all the Boston-area sports teams, including the Patriots.\n''There were some years the Patriots didn't give you very many reasons to cheer,'' Kendall said. ''But I do remember getting caught up in the '85 season and the run to the Super Bowl there against the Chicago Bears.''\nAfter earning all-Big East honors in his junior and senior seasons, Kendall was drafted in the first round by Seattle in 1996. He started 11 games as a rookie and every game the next four seasons. He signed with the Arizona Cardinals as an unrestricted free agent in 2001 and played three seasons for them.\nKendall missed only one start in his first two seasons with the Jets. This season, he missed two starts, including the home opener against New England in Week 2, after he injured his calf in the season opener at Tennessee.\nThe weeks that he was rehabilitating, Kendall could not go home to visit his family. That was tough. This week will be easy, even if most of his five dozen friends and relatives clamoring for game tickets are Patriots fans.\n''We're through the hardest part now,'' Kendall said. He was talking about his family situation, but he could have been referring to this season, when Eric Mangini, a hard-nosed apprentice of Bill Belichick, was hired as coach and the Jets fought their way into the playoffs.\nIn the beginning, when few players would talk about Mangini for fear of incurring his wrath, Kendall was his usual self. ''When a new coach comes in,'' he said in September, ''either you buy in or you get shipped out.''\nKendall encouraged his teammates to buy in, and this week they are collecting their reward.\nEXTRA POINTS\nAfter referring to the Patriots as ''the other place'' for most of the season, Eric Mangini, who came to the Jets after spending six years as an assistant in New England, abruptly changed his speech pattern Wednesday. Ten minutes into his news briefing, in response to a question about Bill Belichick, Mangini began, ''When I was at New England. '' His response drew titters from his audience. When asked to elaborate, Mangini smiled and said, ''We all evolve and change.''\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816337	Now, the Eyes of Texas Are Upon Jones and Parcells	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE2D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Bill Parcells was careful with his words, even as he picked a curious time to hint at his future as Dallas Cowboys coach.\nThe Cowboys play the Seattle Seahawks Saturday in a first-round playoff game, and after having lost three of the last four games, Dallas has more dire matters to consider than when a summit meeting between Parcells and the owner Jerry Jones might occur.\nParcells, though, said Wednesday he and Jones have already picked a time to discuss the issues surrounding a decision on whether Parcells will return for the fifth and final year of his contract.\n''We have an understanding as to what's going to happen,'' Parcells said. ''I'll let you know about that when the season's over. But we do have an understanding. There's no doubt about what's in place and what we're going to talk about and when.''\nAsked if the job was still his if he wanted it, Parcells said: ''Yeah, I think so. But I'm not saying. You'll have to ask him about that.''\nSuccess has been elusive for the Cowboys (9-7) under Parcells, who has yet to match the 10-6 record he posted when he took over in 2003. The Cowboys made the playoffs as a wild card that year, but lost in the first round to the Carolina Panthers. Should they lose to the 9-7 Seahawks, the Cowboys' streak without a playoff victory will have reached 10 seasons.\nThat drought does not sit well with Jones, whose comments to the local news media have included words like pitiful, disgusted, frustrated and disappointed to describe the state of his franchise.\nJones's omnipresence on the Cowboys' sideline, contrasted with Parcells's occasional listless body language, has fueled speculation of a coaching change in a football-crazy area where the weekly vibe can swing from thoughts of the Cowboys winning the Super Bowl to the sky falling through the hole at Texas Stadium.\nParcells bristled at the notion of being at the low point of his career, although that's what he said after a loss earlier this season.\n''You're judging me by a five-minute period after the game, when you experience a great disappointment,'' he said. ''If you judge someone like that, you're always going to take the negative look. But that doesn't mean I'm not willing to go forward.''\nParcells said any decisions would include an overall evaluation and would not be based solely on whether the Cowboys beat the Seahawks, who also limp into the playoffs having lost three of four games.\n''It's not about a 10-day period, a two-week period or one-week period,'' he said. ''You can't make a judgment based on that. You have to make a judgment based on whether you feel like you want to take on this task, you want to do it again, you want to muster up enough energy, because you know you've got another off-season, another draft, another preseason, another regular season, you've got the whole drill. If you're ready to try to do that with the energy that you know is necessary, then you go forward with it.''\nThe Cowboys' defense and the running game -- hallmarks of Parcells's championship Giants teams -- have led the downward spiral. They have allowed an average of 33 points and have also allowed 14 touchdown passes in their last four games, including 4 on Sunday by Detroit's Jon Kitna.\n''We've got enough to worry about,'' guard Marco Rivera said. ''We can't worry about how Bill's feeling or how Jerry's feeling.\n''Each player has to be accountable for himself,'' Rivera said. ''He's got to look at the tape and he's got to say, 'O.K., am I doing enough to help the Cowboys win?' We're professionals. That's our job. If everybody takes care of the things they need to do, our coaches won't feel like that and our owner won't feel like that and we'll win the game.''\nCornerback Aaron Glenn, who also played for Parcells when he coached the Jets, does not believe Parcells has lost his passion.\n''It could be his last year or he could coach for 10 more years,'' Glenn said. ''It would be a sad thing, not just for the team, for the league to lose one of the top coaches of all time. Just like any other coach that retires or moves on. Sometimes it has to end, as a player or a coach. And only you know that. He'll know when it's time.''\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816338	THE FIFTH DOWN	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E1D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Veteran Softie\nSentimental would probably be the last word anyone would use to describe Bill Belichick, but for the second season in a row he gave one of his veteran players a very public farewell gift.\nLast season it was allowing the retiring Doug Flutie to convert an extra point with a drop kick in the season finale. On Sunday against the Titans, he inserted Vinny Testaverde, above, the Patriots' third-string quarterback, with less than three minutes remaining so that he could try to throw a touchdown pass for a 20th consecutive season. Testaverde, who had previously played for Belichick with the Browns and the Jets, found Troy Brown for a 6-yard touchdown with 1 minutes 45 seconds left.\nTestaverde, 43, and Brown, 35, have the oldest combined ages for players connecting on an N.F.L. touchdown pass, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\nWhile Belichick pumped his fists and the Patriots ran to congratulate Testaverde, some of the Titans were fuming. The score increased the Patriots' lead to 40-23. Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth told reporters: ''To bring in a 50-year-old guy to throw a little pass, probably the last pass of his career or of his life, I don't know. Whatever.''\nNice Job, Kid\nWhile Vinny Testaverde was striking a blow for the older generation Sunday, Jets Coach Eric Mangini was joining a different elite subset.\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, since the 1970 A.F.L.-N.F.L. merger, only two coaches younger than Mangini, 35, have led a team to the playoffs: John Madden (twice, at 33 and 34) and Bill Cowher (35).\nMangini and Testaverde may renew acquaintances when the Jets face the Patriots on Sunday. When Testaverde was the starting quarterback for Cleveland in 1984, Mangini, then 13, was breaking into the league as a Browns ball boy.\nThinking Big\nLost amid the record-breaking seasons of LaDainian Tomlinson and Larry Johnson, San Francisco running back Frank Gore broke the 49ers' franchise record with 1,695 rushing yards. He finished third in the N.F.L. and was named to his first Pro Bowl. But he has bigger plans for next season.\n''I'm going for 2,200 next year,'' Gore told reporters as he cleared out his locker Monday. ''That's the record, isn't it? Yeah, I'll get that.''\nThat would be Eric Dickerson's single-season record of 2,105 yards, set in 15 games in 1984.\nEarly Checkout\nThe consolation for Tom Walsh when he was dismissed as the Raiders' offensive coordinator in November was that he could return to the bed-and-breakfast he had run in Idaho. Oakland players like Randy Moss and Jerry Porter remained stuck in their own version of ''Hotel California'' -- they could check out but never leave.\nWalsh had been out of the league since 1994, when he was Art Shell's offensive coordinator in Shell's first stint as Raiders coach. When Walsh rejoined Shell this season and installed his old-school offense of long-developing pass plays, the criticism began mounting.\nA few days before the season, Moss said, ''Things are so fishy and question mark around here.'' In September, the former Raiders receiver Tim Brown said Walsh's offense was outdated even in the 1990s, calling it horrible and one-dimensional.\nIn November, quarterback Andrew Walter said the playbook lacked depth. He was promptly benched.\nThe result was the league's worst offense, which scored 12 touchdowns, or 72 points, in 16 games. By comparison, the Chargers' LaDainian Tomlinson scored 186 points.\nA.F.C. Has Its Way\nA.F.C. teams had a 40-24 record against N.F.C. teams during the regular season. Three were 4-0, all of them playoff teams -- New England, San Diego and Kansas City. Over all, A.F.C. playoff teams were 21-3 against the N.F.C. in the regular season. More specifically, A.F.C playoff teams were 6-2 against N.F.C playoff teams. N.F.C. playoff teams were 10-14 against A.F.C. teams, with the Giants faring the best at 3-1.\nIt Wasn't Luck, He Says\nCoach Herman Edwards bristled when reporters suggested that the Chiefs were lucky to qualify for the playoffs. ''We didn't luck our way into it,'' Edwards told The Associated Press on Monday. ''We won our way into it, just like those other teams had to win their way into it. And they didn't do it, to be quite honest.''\nThe Chiefs (9-7) were the beneficiaries of an unlikely series of events. As Edwards famously said when he was Jets coach, ''You play to win the game.''\nBut it sure helps when everyone else that matters loses theirs.\nThe Chiefs first had to hand the Jaguars, who were also contending for a playoff spot, their third straight loss, which they did, 35-30.\nNext, they needed the Broncos, the Titans and the Bengals to lose at home. The Broncos lost with less than two minutes left in overtime on a 36-yard field goal. The Titans lost after trailing by 3 points going into the fourth quarter. And the Bengals, who also lost in overtime, missed a game-winning field goal at the end of regulation.\nLong-Armed Lion\nJon Kitna had 4,208 passing yards this season for the 3-13 Lions, the 30th time in the past 10 seasons that a quarterback has topped 4,000 yards. But Kitna is only the fifth player in that span to do it for a losing team.\nThe others are Jeff Garcia (4,278 for the 6-10 49ers in 2000), Elvis Grbac (4,164 for the 7-9 Chiefs in 2000), Peyton Manning (4,131 for the 6-10 Colts in 2001) and Trent Green (4,594 for the 7-9 Chiefs in 2004).\nThe 306-yard performance by Kitna against Dallas on Sunday could have, at least temporarily, saved his job. The win put the Lions behind the Raiders for the top pick in the 2007 draft and may have put Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn out of reach.\nExtra Points\nWith the Eagles, the Cowboys and the Giants in the playoffs, this is the first time since realignment in 2002 that three teams from the same division have reached the postseason. The last time that happened was 2001, when three teams from the A.F.C. East (New England, Miami and the Jets) and the N.F.C. Central (Chicago, Tampa Bay and Green Bay) made the playoffs. Shaun Alexander extended his league record for games with at least one 10-yard run to 64, a span of more than four full seasons.\nPRO FOOTBALL\nCorrection: January 9, 2007, Tuesday A report in the Fifth Down football roundup on Thursday about the American Football Conference's dominance over the National Football Conference during the regular season misstated the N.F.C. playoff team that had the best record (3-1) against A.F.C. teams. It is the Dallas Cowboys -- not the Giants, who were 1-3.
1816339	Year Ends With Lows For Detroit	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E1D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Detroit auto show, which opens next week, is all about new concepts, building buzz and making fresh starts. And the Detroit auto companies can use all of that.\nIn a stern reminder of how hard it has become to sell cars, General Motors, the Ford Motor and the Chrysler Group ended 2006 with two lows, the companies said Wednesday. Their dismal December performance led to their lowest collective market share ever, just 51.5 percent for the month.\nAnd for the year, they held only 53.7 percent of the market, also a low. The reason for the poor showing rests mostly with a lineup laden with sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that proved out of fashion with Americans' demand for fuel-sipping automobiles.\n''Basically, that caught Detroit by surprise,'' said Ron Pinelli, president of Autodata, which tracks industry statistics.\nSo did the strength of Toyota Motor of Japan, which set a sales record in 2006 to pass DaimlerChrysler and take third place in the American car market. Now it is bearing down on Ford, which it is expected to unseat this year to take second place, behind G.M.\nWednesday's sales report proves that despite the gleaming new models that are set to go on display at the Cobo Center in Detroit this weekend, the competition on the streets will be just as fierce next year, even though gasoline prices are easing.\nAt best, analysts and auto executives expect industry sales to be flat with the 16.5 million sold in 2006, down from 16.9 million sold in 2005, according to Autodata.\nAt worst, some forecasters see sales falling as low as 16 million vehicles, which could force the Detroit companies to speed or expand their revamping plans. ''How do you make profits with less sales?'' said Jesse Toprak, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com, which offers car-buying advice.\nNo matter the outcome, one thing seems certain: cars are back, big time.\nToyota, whose sales rose 12.9 percent last year, gained more than two percentage points to end the year with 15.4 percent of American sales. It sold almost 450,000 Camry sedans, the nation's best-selling car for the fifth consecutive year, and nearly 400,000 small Corollas.\n''We're a company that continues to listen to the market,'' said James Lentz, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A.\nA bonus for Toyota was its Scion brands, three small vehicles aimed at the industry's youngest buyers. That division racked up almost as many sales last year as Ford did for its Mercury division.\nHonda Motor, meanwhile, said its sales rose 3.5 percent in 2006 to its 10th consecutive record, mostly because of a strong reception for its small car, the Fit. Together, Toyota and Honda sold almost as many cars and trucks in the United States as G.M., where 2006 sales dropped 8.7 percent.\nEven Ford, whose overall sales fell 7.9 percent in 2006, could point to its cars as a glimmer of hope. It scored a modest-selling hit in the last year with the midsize Fusion, and it is showing a four-door version of the Mustang at the Detroit show, hoping to build on its pony car's success.\nBut Ford's efforts on cars cannot camouflage its slumping truck lineup. Sales of its Explorer S.U.V., once the star of its stable of sport utilities, fell 25.3 percent in 2006, while its F-series pickup dropped 11.7 percent. All told, it sold 105,000 fewer of those vehicles than it did in 2005.\nFord will not overhaul the F-series for more than a year, although it plans a new Super Duty model this winter.\nBy contrast, G.M. has begun selling new models of its pickup, and Toyota will begin selling the biggest version yet of its Tundra next month.\n''I think the full-size truck market is going to look very much like a sumo wrestling match,'' said Ford's senior sales analyst, George C. Pipas. ''There is going to be pushing and shoving,''\nPaul Ballew, G.M.'s executive director of global market and industry analysis, said the company expected its sales of pickups to remain flat this year.\n''I know it's been in vogue this year to talk about the sun setting on the truck business; we obviously disagree with that,'' Mr. Ballew said. ''We don't see the market shrinking, and we see our performance as more than holding our own.''\nG.M. did not hold its own in December. Its sales fell 8.7 percent, more than analysts had anticipated given a year-end rebate effort, while its market share for the month was 23.5 percent, compared with an average for the year of 24.3 percent. By contrast, G.M. ended 2005 with 26 percent of the American market.\nIn the last few months, G.M. executives maintained that the company's market share decline had bottomed out, which helped it fend off pressure from the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, who had been its biggest individual shareholder before unloading much of his 9.9 percent stake.\nBut lately, some analysts have voiced concern that G.M.'s lineup lacks compelling vehicles beyond its pickups, which it expects will sell strongly.\n''We believe that a more radical and aggressive approach will need to be taken to turn the company around, most specifically in North America,'' John Murphy, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said in a research note on Wednesday, repeating his sell rating on G.M. stock.\nThere is also concern in the industry over Chrysler, which offered generous rebates during December to clear out backlogs on dealer lots, especially of leftover 2006 models. Its sales rose 1 percent, though December sales for DaimlerChrysler, including Mercedes, fell 1 percent. For the year, Chrysler sales fell 6.7 percent. Yesterday, the company announced a new wave of incentives of up to $5,000 on some new models.\nMr. Pinelli said the dismal end to a dismal year was a warning to American auto makers that analysts said was long overdue.\n''Detroit gets it now,'' he said. ''They realize that the market-share battle and survival are going to be based on product as well as an image that needs to be revitalized.''\nCorrection: May 4, 2007, Friday A picture in the auto sales chart in Business Day on Wednesday was published in error. It showed a Nissan Altima Coupe, which is not on the market yet, rather than the Altima sedan, which had a 12.4 percent drop in sales in April. (The error first occurred in the sales chart on Jan. 4.)
1816340	G.E. Magic Can Fade, After G.E.	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E1D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	When boards of directors go shopping for a new chief executive, their first stop is often General Electric.\nAfter all, its disciplined approach to management, the ''G.E. Way,'' has been chronicled in a shelf's worth of books, including ''Winning,'' by its former chief executive, John F. Welch Jr., who gets much of the credit for his system of building a deep bench of talent. That system included rotating executives through many jobs, teaching them productivity and quality-control tools like Six Sigma, and training them at the company's vaunted management school.\nG.E. executives were in such demand that just one week after Mr. Welch tapped Jeffrey R. Immelt as his successor in late 2000, the two runners-up were immediately lured away. Home Depot recruited Robert L. Nardelli, and 3M took W. James McNerney Jr.\nBut the ouster of Mr. Nardelli from Home Depot raises anew the question of whether G.E. executives are so bankable when they switch to new companies. The answer, many management experts say, is not necessarily.\nThough Mr. McNerney has succeeded at both 3M and then at Boeing, Mr. Nardelli joins Lawrence R. Johnston, another high-flying G.E. executive who left in 2001 for a troubled tenure at Albertson's, among the alumni who did not live up to expectations.\n''G.E. is still the best training ground on the planet, but that still doesn't mean that everyone is going to succeed,'' said Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School who has written extensively about G.E.\nIf there is any pattern, experts say, it is that G.E. executives succeed when they switch to companies that are, well, a lot like G.E. -- big industrial firms that are dominant in their fields, or that need an infusion of manufacturing and research discipline, or that must grow by acquisition.\nBy contrast, they tend to have more trouble in companies, retailers like Home Depot, that require more fingertip feel to manage.\n''G.E. people are good at getting structure, system and strategy right, but they don't always understand the soft issues like culture,'' said Boris Groysberg, an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School who recently studied 20 star G.E. managers who went on to run other companies.\nMany management experts say that the very command and control management style that has characterized many successful G.E. executives may have led to Mr. Nardelli's downfall. They note that he shifted Home Depot's emphasis to the commercial market, installed all sorts of productivity tools and otherwise ''G.E.-ified'' the company.\nBut, they say, he did not recognize that sales associates react differently than white-collar managers to change, and thus need different incentives to embrace it. He closed stores and moved people around, which meant that many sales staff found themselves with new bosses.\nHe insisted that shelves be stocked during off hours, and he instituted formal inventory control and performance evaluation systems.\n''He was foisting all this change on people who aren't necessarily looking to rise to higher levels in the organization, and so didn't see any upside for themselves in any of it,'' said Batia M. Wiesenfeld, associate professor of management at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University.\nThe style did not necessarily work for ambitious managers either, said Anthony J. Mayo, a lecturer at the Harvard Business School. ''He brought a classic G.E. top-down, autocratic command and control approach and style, which just did not work out of the context of G.E.,'' he said.\nMr. Mayo includes Mr. Welch, Stanley Gault, Lawrence Bossidy and several other former G.E. executives in his coming book, ''In Their Time: The Greatest Business Leaders of the 20th Century.'' But he said that his research turned up many ex-G.E executives who ignored ''context-based management,'' his term for tailoring management approaches to specific situations.\nThe G.E. way was particularly out of place in a retail operation, said James E. Schrager, clinical professor of entrepreneurship and strategy at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. ''Boards get overenthusiastic about the G.E. glow,'' he said. ''They forget that there's a big divide between selling light bulbs and appliances to stores and running the stores that sell them to consumers.''\nMr. Nardelli is not the first G.E. alumnus who took on another company amid much fanfare, only to leave under a cloud. John B. Blystone left G.E. to run the SPX Corporation in 1995; at first, shareholders applauded his cost-cutting methods. But revenue stalled. Mr. Blystone resigned in 2004 ''to spend more time with his family,'' amid controversy over his sale of SPX shares before the release of lackluster quarterly results.\nShares of Conseco leaped in 2000 when Gary C. Wendt, then the head of GE Capital, became its new chief. He was unable to turn the company around, and two years later he relinquished the chief executive slot; Conseco soon filed for bankruptcy protection.\nMr. Johnston left G.E. to run Albertson's in 2001; he closed stores and cut jobs, but still could not compete with the Wal-Mart juggernaut. Albertson's sales and stock plunged, and the company was eventually sold.\n''G.E. people bring a great tool kit with them, but they really need the global learning centers, the diverse product portfolio, the access to capital, all of the resources of G.E. to maximize its value,'' said Nicholas P. Heymann, who follows G.E. for Prudential Securities.\nThere are many success stories too, of course. Mr. Bossidy, one of Mr. Welch's hand-groomed executives, was considered a savior at Allied Signal (later Honeywell), as was Mr. Gault at Rubbermaid. Kirk Hachigian continues to get high marks at Cooper Industries. John Trani ran into problems with Stanley Work's unions toward the end of his tenure, but he nonetheless is credited with whipping the company's costs and operations into shape before he retired in 2003.\nAnd, of course, Mr. McNerney, who left G.E. to run 3M at the same time that Mr. Nardelli left for Home Depot, got 3M's sales and stock price way up. He recently left to head Boeing, and most analysts expect him to do well there, too.\nThe success stories, experts say, have several things in common: The companies were manufacturers that needed to cut costs, pump up product innovation and grow by acquisition -- all skills that are finely honed at G.E. In contrast, Albertson's and Home Depot are retailers, an area that G.E. has not touched save for a brief and unrewarding stint owning Montgomery Ward.\nSPX needed to expand businesses it already owned -- something that was emphasized far less by Mr. Welch than it is by Mr. Immelt, G.E.'s current chief. And Conseco was foundering -- a company G.E. would never have bought, and probably would have sold.\n''The errors come in when G.E. people feel they learned all the secrets at G.E.,'' said Ms.. Wiesenfeld of New York University. They become enamored of their own knowledge, she added, ''and don't feel they have to learn about the business they are going into.''\nMr. Immelt, G.E.'s current chief, has not been cheered by shareholders throughout much of his tenure. He took over from Mr. Welch in September 2001, just in time for the terrorist attack of Sept. 11 to wreak havoc with G.E. insurance, aircraft leasing and other businesses. And he also suffered through two years of share price stagnation, which ended just last month.\nShareholders did not clamor for his resignation, though. One reason, analysts say, was that Mr. Immelt seemed to understand the problems, and was installing innovation processes and product lines to fix them.\nAnother reason was that his total compensation package -- $8,534,829 in 2004 and $3,400,769 million in 2005 -- was well below the sums paid to other chief executives like Mr. Nardelli.\nA CHAIRMAN'S FALL
1816341	A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Arrogance has never been attractive in a leader. Now, in corporate chief executives anyhow, it may be a career ender.\nThe surprising defenestration yesterday of Robert L. Nardelli, head of Home Depot and one of the nation's most imperious and highly paid chief executives, was a victory for shareholders hoping to force corporate directors to be more accountable on the increasingly incendiary issue of executive pay.\nEven though the board gave him $20 million that was not a part of his employment contract, perhaps smoothing his way out the door, the departure seemed to be a watershed. No longer can executives demand -- and directors happily grant -- contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars without at least some shareholders uttering a peep.\nIndeed, Mr. Nardelli's resignation seems to indicate a rising fear among Home Depot's directors that they would be subject to even more investor ire and personal embarrassment during the 2007 proxy season than they encountered in 2006, when Mr. Nardelli ran the annual shareholder meeting like a lord over his fief.\n''The departure of Nardelli is good news for shareholders,'' said Frederick E. Rowe Jr., a money manager in Dallas and president of Investors for Director Accountability. ''To borrow from Winston Churchill, this is the end of the beginning in the war to make directors accountable to the shareholder owners they represent.'' Mr. Nardelli's fall from the executive firmament was fairly stunning. In just six years, he went from being one of the most sought-after chief executives, forged in the management crucible that is General Electric, to a top target of investors outraged by his $245 million in total pay over the last five years. That amount was seen as completely at odds with the dismal performance of Home Depot stock on his watch. Yesterday, the shares closed at $41.07, almost 6 percent lower than they were the day Mr. Nardelli arrived at Home Depot in December 2000.\n''C.E.O.'s now will understand that they've got to put their conscience and shareholder wealth well above their personal gain,'' said Jeffrey M. Cunningham, chairman and chief executive of Directorship, an online information service for board members. ''Boards create termination packages when no one even contemplates there is going to be a termination and they are extraordinarily rich. You are going to see all those plans rethought and rationalized for the new environment.''\nShareholders of Home Depot have been smoldering for several years about the company's executive pay practices. Back when Mr. Nardelli arrived, for example, shareholders raised eyebrows after the company granted him a $10 million loan that it subsequently forgave. He has earned $20 million to $37 million each year since he joined the company.\nIn 2004, the company quietly changed the measurement it used to calculate long-term incentive pay for executives, upsetting investors when they learned of it later. Previously, the performance measure was based on a peer-group comparison, but the new measure involved only the company's growth in earnings per share. It was more easily reached because it was based solely on Home Depot's performance not that of other companies.\nTo some shareholders, changing the performance target in the middle of a year seemed an attempt to ensure a payout despite a dismal performance.\n''We had a problem with that change,'' said Bess Joffe, manager for the Americas at Hermes Investment Management, a money management firm owned by the British Telecom Pension Scheme, the largest pension plan in Britain. ''After all, shareholders don't get to change the terms under which they bought their shares midstream.''\nBut it was not until last year that Home Depot's shareholders began to express serious disenchantment with the company's directors over Mr. Nardelli's pay. Last March, about two months before Home Depot's annual shareholder meeting, the board was named one of the 11 worst executive pay offenders by the Corporate Library, a corporate governance research firm. In the weeks leading up to the meeting, shareholder advisory firms recommended withholding votes from Home Depot directors to voice their dismay over the disconnect between performance and pay at the company.\nBut Mr. Nardelli's biggest error, and the act that may have set his demise in motion, was his shocking decision to run the annual meeting last May alone, insisting that his directors stay away and limiting questions from the shareholders.\n''I've never heard of anything like that happening before, where directors don't show up,'' Ms. Joffe said. ''It's the one time of year that shareholders have a right to be present and stand up and speak their mind and directors have to respond.''\nStockholders were outraged. At least 30 percent of shareholders voting at the meeting withheld support from 10 of the company's directors. Some 32 percent withheld support from Mr. Nardelli. Almost 36 percent of those voting withheld support from Claudio X. Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive of Kimberly-Clark's Mexico operations and the director who had headed the compensation committee when the company changed its performance goals midstream.\nMany shareholders also favored a proposal urging the Home Depot board to allow its investors to vote on an advisory basis to approve the company's compensation; 40 percent voted for the measure.\nShareholders also supported a measure that would have required the board to accept resignations from directors who failed to receive support from a majority of votes cast. After the meeting, Home Depot said it would require such a vote from shareholders for the election of its directors.\nEven so, the company continued to tinker last year with its pay practices in a way that may have been intended to generate pay for Mr. Nardelli in periods of poor performance at the company. Last November, a Home Depot spokesman disclosed that the company's huge stock buybacks, which have the effect of increasing earnings when measured per share, would be included in the calculation of long-term incentive targets. In previous years, the effects of the buybacks were excluded from the calculations.\nJohn A. Hill, the chairman of Putnam Funds, was one investor whose organization voted against Home Depot management at last year's meeting. He said he was optimistic that Mr. Nardelli's resignation signaled a new responsiveness among corporate directors. But he is uncertain.\n''I think if a lot more shareholders withhold their votes for this board in the upcoming proxy season over their agreement with Nardelli, then it will really start to have an impact,'' Mr. Hill said. ''But as long as it is a minority, it won't.''\nMr. Hill personally experienced Mr. Nardelli's disdain toward his shareholders. As chairman of Putnam Funds, he wrote a letter after the annual meeting to Mr. Nardelli explaining why he had not earned the funds' support at the election. He did not get a reply until August, when a reporter asked Home Depot why the chief executive had not responded to one of its large shareholders.\n''He had become a lightning rod with the stock down,'' Mr. Hill said. ''But his not replying to our letter showed an arrogance there that came in on him.''\nIt seems that ''my way or the highway'' -- Mr. Nardelli's message to Home Depot's beleaguered shareholders in recent years -- does not play that well anymore.\nMARKET PLACE
1816342	Fewer Excuses For Not Doing A PC Backup	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	If there's one New Year's resolution even more likely to fail than ''I vow to lose weight,'' it's ''I vow to start backing up my computer.''\nAfter all, setting up and remembering to use a backup system is a huge hassle. The odds are good that you don't have an up-to-date backup at this very moment.\nFortunately, 2007 may turn out to be the Year of the Backup. Both Microsoft and Apple have built automated backup software into the latest versions of their operating systems, both to be introduced this year.\nAt the same time, an option that was once complex, limited and expensive is suddenly becoming effortless, capacious and even free: online backups, where files are shuttled off to the Internet for safekeeping.\nOnline backup means never having to buy or manage backup disks. You can have access to your files from any computer anywhere. And above all, your files are safe even if disaster should befall your office -- like fire, flood, burglary or marauding children.\nAs it turns out, the Web is brimming with backup services. Most of them, however, offer only 1 or 2 gigabytes' worth of free storage.\nThat may be plenty if all you keep on your PC is recipes and a few letters to the editor. But if you have even a fledgling photo or music collection, 2 gigs is peanuts. You can pay for more storage, of course, but the prices have been outrageous; at Data Deposit Box, for example, backing up 50 gigabytes of data will cost you $1,200 a year.\nNobody offers unlimited free storage, but lately, they've gotten a lot closer. Two companies, Xdrive and MediaMax, offer as much as 25 gigabytes of free backups; two others, Mozy and Carbonite, offer unlimited storage for less than $55 a year.\n(Note that this roundup doesn't include Web sites that are exclusively dedicated to sharing photos or videos, like Flickr and MediaFire. It also omits the services intended for sending huge files to other people, like YouSendIt and SendThisFile; such sites delete your files after a couple of weeks -- not a great feature in a backup system.)\nXDRIVE This service, owned by AOL, offers 5 gigabytes of free storage. It's polished, easy to use, and as fully fledged as they come. Right on the Web site, you can back up entire lists of folders at a time, a method that works on Macintosh, Windows or Unix.\nIf you use Windows, however, an even better backup system awaits. You can download Xdrive Desktop, a full-blown, unattended backup program. It quietly backs up your computer on a schedule that you specify, without any additional thought or input from you.\nBetter yet, a new disk icon appears on your PC (labeled X), that represents your files on the Web. You can open and use its contents as though it's an ordinary, if slowish, hard drive. A Mac version of Xdrive Desktop is in the works.\nAs a bonus, you can share certain backed-up folders, so that other people can have access to them from their Macs or PCs. (This requires, however, that they sign up for their own free Xdrive accounts.) You can view your backed-up photos as an online slideshow, or organize and play your backed-up music files on the Web page.\nUpgrading your storage to 50 gigabytes costs $100 a year, which isn't such a good deal. But if your Documents folder fits in 5 gigabytes, then congratulations; you've got yourself a free, effortless, automatic backup system. Happy New Year.\nCARBONITE This one's as pure a backup play as you'll find; there's no folder sharing, photo viewing or music organizing. The Windows-only backup software is completely automatic and stays entirely out of your way, quietly backing up whenever you're not working. You get no free storage -- the service costs $50 a year -- but you do get something else few others offer: an unlimited amount of backup storage.\nCarbonite is aimed at nontechnical audiences. It's sold in computer and office-supply stores, for example, and it's the easiest online backup software to use -- in fact, to not use, since it's completely automatic. The only change you'll see are small colored dots on files and folders that have been backed up -- and a Carbonite disk icon in your My Computer window that ''contains'' all the backed-up folders and files.\nAt the moment, Carbonite doesn't back up individual files that are larger than 2 gigabytes. It also doesn't back up pieces of files, so if your 500-megabyte Outlook e-mail database changes, the whole database must be backed up again. And, of course, there's no Macintosh version. The company says that a new version, due in April, will wipe out all three of these drawbacks.\nMOZY In many regards, the recently introduced Mozy is a Carbonite copycat. The price is $55 a year, storage is unlimited, an automated background Windows program keeps your PC continuously backed up and a Mac version is planned.\nMozy offers 2 gigabytes of backup at no charge. If you're willing to do the company's marketing for it, you can nab another free gig for every four people you persuade to sign up.\nMozy is more flexible, too -- and more technical. It can back up only changed portions of files. You can specify times and dates for backups (instead of offering only the Continuous option, like Carbonite). You can view 30 days' worth of backups, too -- a feature that prevents you from deleting a file from your PC accidentally and then finding its deletion mirrored in your latest backup. And Mozy offers dozens of novice-hostile options like ''Enable Bandwidth Throttle'' and ''Don't back up if the CPU is over this % busy.''\nMEDIAMAX Talk about value. How does 25 gigabytes of free storage strike you?\nThe service began life with an emphasis on organizing and sharing photos, video and music -- which it still does well. But its new Windows backup program, now in beta testing, adds automated unattended backups of any kind of computer files, just like its rivals.\nIt's pretty bare-bones; for example, it offers no continuous real-time backup, no choice of weekdays -- only an option to back up every day, every three days, or whatever. And you can back up only folders, not individual files or file types.\nIn times of disaster, MediaMax will give you your files back, but won't put them in their original folders. More important, the free account lets you download or share only one gigabyte of data a month. That pretty much means that to restore your hard drive after a crash, you'll have to upgrade to a paid account. Still, when you're standing there, sobbing over the smoking remains of your dead hard drive, you probably won't mind paying $10 or $25 to get your stuff back.\nSUMMING UP Now, there are some disadvantages to all of these services. One of them is time: even with a high-speed Internet connection, the first backup can take days to complete. Maintaining your backup is much faster, of course, because only new or changed files are uploaded to the Web. But if disaster ever strikes, retrieving your files can also take days. (Mozy offers a solution that gets you your files faster: a DVD of your files, shipped overnight for an added fee. For example, to FedEx a 50-gigabyte backup to you on DVDs, Mozy charges about $90.)\nThen there's the security thing. All four companies insist that your files are encrypted before they even leave your computer. But if you still can't shake the image of backup-company employees rooting through your files and laughing their heads off, then this may not be the backup method for you.\nCorporate longevity may be a more realistic worry. Since the Internet itself is very young, no Web-based outfit has a particularly long track record.Any of these services could be discontinued or sold at any time, which makes it wise to make the occasional on-site backup, too.\nIn any case, the main thing is to have some kind of backup. After all, there are only two kinds of people: Those who back up their computers, and those who will.\nSTATE OF THE ART E-mail: Pogue@nytimes.com
1816343	New Disc May Sway DVD Wars	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E0D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Consumers wary of buying new high-definition DVD players because of a technology war reminiscent of the days of Betamax versus VHS will soon have a new kind of DVD that might make the decision less daunting.\nWarner Brothers, which helped popularize the DVD more than a decade ago, plans to announce next week a single videodisc that can play films and television programs in both Blu-ray and HD-DVD, the rival DVD technologies.\nWarner Brothers, a division of Time Warner, plans to formally announce the new disc, which it is calling a Total HD disc, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday.\nTwo rival camps introduced high-definition DVD players last year: a consortium called Blu-ray, backed by Sony and others, and a group called HD-DVD, backed by Toshiba and Microsoft. Retail and media executives say this clash of corporate titans and their incompatible machines has left some consumers bewildered and has slowed the introduction of what is intended to be the next great thing in home entertainment.\nExecutives at Time Warner and its Hollywood subsidiary hope to spur sales of new DVD players and movies by gaining the support of retailers and cajoling rival studios into making their film and television libraries available in both formats on a single disc.\nIn addition to reviving the ghost of the war that marked the introduction of videocassettes in the 1980s, the high-definition battle has been exacerbated by the decision of several major studios to support only one of the technologies.\nThus, for instance, a copy of 20th Century Fox's ''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' is available only on Blu-ray, while Universal's ''The Break-Up'' can be viewed only on a disc and player built with HD-DVD technology.\nBarry M. Meyer, the chairman and chief executive of Warner Brothers, said in an interview that the company came up with the Total HD disc after concluding that neither Blu-ray nor HD-DVD was going the way of Betamax anytime soon.\n''The next best thing is to recognize that there will be two formats and to make that not a negative for the consumer,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''We felt that the most significant constituency for us to satisfy was the consumer first, and the retailer second. The retailer wants to sell hardware and doesn't want to be forced into stocking two formats for everything. This is ideal for them.''\nIn a world besotted with gadgetry, few consumer products have generated as much excitement -- and head-scratching -- as high-definition television. Flat-screen, high-definition TVs have been flying off the shelves for the last year and are now as common in homes as coffee pots. Yet few people are actually watching superclear high-definition programming.\nPart of the disconnect is the lack of high-definition programming on cable and satellite television, and the additional outlay for decoder boxes and premium channels needed to get it. The rival movie player technologies have further blurred the outlook for high definition. Richard Greenfield, an analyst at Pali Capital, predicted in a recent report that this would be the first year since the introduction of the DVD that consumer spending on the discs would decline, putting pressure on the studios that rely heavily on them for profits.\nFor now, Sony; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which is owned by private equity firms in partnership with the Comcast Corporation and Sony; 20th Century Fox, a division of the News Corporation; and Walt Disney Pictures are all exclusively releasing their DVDs in Blu-ray.\nUniversal Studios, which is owned by General Electric, is releasing only in HD-DVD. Warner and Paramount Pictures, a division of Viacom, are issuing DVDs in both formats.\nBehind these allegiances are complex strategic questions revolving around everything from manufacturing costs to profit margins, debates over each format's technical strengths and weaknesses, and how these players relate to Microsoft and Sony's video-game strategies.\n(Blu-ray players are built into the new Sony PlayStation 3, while Microsoft is selling HD-DVD drives that attach to its Xbox 360.)\nAnother wrinkle is plans by LG Electronics, and possibly other gadget makers attending the Las Vegas conference, to announce new DVD players with drives for both formats; however, such players will most likely be initially more expensive than other players.\nJeffrey L. Bewkes, the president of Time Warner, said the Total HD disc has a better chance of catching on than dual players. Research commissioned by Warner indicates that consumers are willing to pay several dollars more than current high-definition DVDs for a disc that works on both players. At the Web site for Best Buy, Warner's ''Superman Returns'' DVD was selling yesterday for $19.99 in its standard format, $29.99 for Blu-ray and $34.99 for HD-DVD.\nStill, it is not clear whether news of Warner's Total HD disc would convince the studio heads who are backing one format or the other to release their wares in both. Sony, of course, has placed a big bet on Blu-ray's success and does not want to relive the sting of Betamax's defeat. The number of studios committed solely to Blu-ray has been seen as a competitive edge, particularly because HD-DVD came to market several months ahead of Blu-ray.\nAnd HD-DVD's boosters say they doubt gaming fans who have been snapping up the just-introduced PlayStation 3 will take advantage of its built-in Blu-ray player and buy movies as well as video games.\nIn recent interviews, executives at Fox and Disney were unequivocal in their support for Blu-ray. They said they believed that releasing DVDs in both formats would only prolong confusion and the emergence of a winning format. ''I think the fastest way to end the format war is through decisiveness and strength,'' said Bob Chapek, the president of Buena Vista Worldwide Entertainment, the home video arm of Walt Disney.\nLike other Blu-ray proponents and partners, Mr. Chapek said that he favors Blu-ray because of its greater storage capacity and other attributes. HD-DVD offers the same vivid picture by storing less information on its disc, which means fewer minutes of video and other features. However, among its perceived advantages, HD-DVD players are less expensive and also play standard DVDs, while Blu-ray players do not.\nBecause of manufacturing complexities, the Total HD disc will not contain a standard format version, said Kevin Tsujihara, the president of Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Group. However, several months ago the company filed patents for a new disc incorporating all three formats, which it could produce in the future.\nMr. Tsujihara described the new disc as an elegant way for studios to make their content available more widely ''in a way that is not conceding defeat'' for the format they have been backing.\nIn the short term, Total HD would actually add to the number of formats retailers will have to stock, raising it from three to four. However, Irynne V. MacKay, senior vice president for entertainment products at Circuit City, said she supported the idea because it took pressure off consumers puzzling over which format to invest in. ''The simpler the future is for us, the better,'' said Ms. MacKay.\nCorrection: January 5, 2007, Friday An article in Business Day yesterday about a proposed high-definition videodisc that will play on rival technologies referred incorrectly to one capability of the Blu-ray players, a rival to the HD-DVD technology. Blu-Ray players do, in fact, play standard DVDs, as do HD-DVD players. One difference is that some new HD-DVD discs are sold in a combination format that will also play on standard DVD players, while Blu-Ray discs currently do not have this feature.
1816344	Mother Wonders If Psychosis Drug Helped Kill Son	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E0D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	At first, the psychiatric drug Zyprexa may have saved John Eric Kauffman's life, rescuing him from his hallucinations and other symptoms of acute psychosis.\nBut while taking Zyprexa for five years, Mr. Kauffman, who had been a soccer player in high school and had maintained a normal weight into his mid-30s, gained about 80 pounds. He was found dead on March 27 at his apartment in Decatur, Ga., just outside Atlanta.\nAn autopsy showed that the 41-year-old Mr. Kauffman, who was 5 feet 10 inches, weighed 259 pounds when he died. His mother believes that the weight he gained while on Zyprexa contributed to the heart disease that killed him.\nEli Lilly, which makes Zyprexa, said in a statement that Mr. Kauffman had other medical conditions that could have led to his death and that ''Zyprexa is a lifesaving drug.'' The company said it was saddened by Mr. Kauffman's death.\nNo one would say Mr. Kauffman had an easy life. Like millions of other Americans, he suffered from bipolar disorder, a mental illness characterized by periods of depression and mania that can end with psychotic hallucinations and delusions.\nAfter his final breakdown, in 2000, a hospital in Georgia put Mr. Kauffman on Zyprexa, a powerful antipsychotic drug. Like other medicines Mr. Kauffman had taken, the Zyprexa stabilized his moods. For the next five and a half years, his illness remained relatively controlled. But his weight ballooned -- a common side effect of Zyprexa.\nHis mother, Millie Beik, provided information about Mr. Kauffman, including medical records, to The New York Times.\nFor many patients, the side effects of Zyprexa are severe. Connecting them to specific deaths can be difficult, because people with mental illness develop diabetes and heart disease more frequently than other adults. But in 2002, a statistical analysis conducted for Eli Lilly found that compared with an older antipsychotic drug, Haldol, patients taking Zyprexa would be significantly more likely to develop heart disease, based on the results of a clinical trial comparing the two drugs. Exactly how many people have died as a result of Zyprexa's side effects, and whether Lilly adequately disclosed those risks, are central issues in the thousands of product-liability lawsuits pending against the company, and in state and federal investigations.\nBecause Mr. Kauffman also smoked heavily for much of his life, and led a sedentary existence in his last years, no one can be sure that the weight he gained while on Zyprexa caused his heart attack.\nZyprexa, taken by about two million people worldwide last year, is approved to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Besides causing severe weight gain, it increases blood sugar and cholesterol in many people who take it, all risk factors for heart disease.\nIn a statement responding to questions for this article, Lilly said it had reported the death of Mr. Kauffman to federal regulators, as it is legally required to do. The company said it could not comment on the specific causes of his death but noted that the report it submitted to regulators showed that he had ''a complicated medical history that may have led to this unfortunate outcome.''\n''Zyprexa,'' Lilly's statement said, ''is a lifesaving drug and it has helped millions of people worldwide with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder regain control of their lives.''\nDocuments provided to The Times by a lawyer who represents mentally ill patients show that Eli Lilly, which makes Zyprexa, has sought for a decade to play down those side effects -- even though its own clinical trials show the drug causes 16 percent of the patients who take Zyprexa to gain more than 66 pounds after a year.\nEli Lilly now faces federal and state investigations about the way it marketed Zyprexa. Last week -- after articles in The Times about the Zyprexa documents -- Australian drug regulators ordered Lilly to provide more information about what it knew, and when, about Zyprexa's side effects.\nLilly says side effects from Zyprexa must be measured against the potentially devastating consequences of uncontrolled mental illness. But some leading psychiatrists say that because of its physical side effects Zyprexa should be used only by patients who are acutely psychotic and that patients should take other medicines for long-term treatment.\n''Lilly always downplayed the side effects,'' said Dr. S. Nassir Ghaemi, a specialist on bipolar disorder at Emory University in Atlanta. ''They've tended to admit weight gain, but in various ways they've minimized its relevance.''\nDr. Ghaemi said Lilly had also encouraged an overly positive view of its studies on the effectiveness of Zyprexa as a long-term treatment for bipolar disorder. There is more data to support the use of older and far cheaper drugs like lithium, he said.\nLast year, Lilly paid $700 million to settle 8,000 lawsuits from people who said they had developed diabetes or other diseases after taking Zyprexa. Thousands more suits are still pending.\nBut Ms. Beik is not suing Lilly. She simply wants her son's case to be known, she said, because she considers it a cautionary tale about Zyprexa's tendency to cause severe weight gain. ''I don't think that price should be paid,'' she said.\nMr. Kauffman's story, like that of many people with severe mental illness, is one of a slow and steady decline.\nGrowing up in DeKalb, Ill., west of Chicago, he acted in school plays and was a goalie on the soccer team. A photograph taken at his prom in 1982 shows a handsome young man with a messy mop of dark brown hair.\nBut in 1984, in his freshman year at Beloit College in Wisconsin, Mr. Kauffman suffered a breakdown and was found to have the most severe form of bipolar disorder. He returned home and, after medication stabilized his condition, enrolled in Northern Illinois University. He graduated from there in 1989 with a degree in political science.\nFor the next year, he worked as a bus driver ferrying senior citizens around DeKalb. In a short local newspaper profile of him in 1990, he listed his favorite book as ''Catch-22,'' his favorite musician as Elvis Costello, and his favorite moment in life as a soccer game in which he had made 47 saves. A few months later, he followed his mother and stepfather to Atlanta and enrolled in Georgia State University, hoping to earn a master's degree in political science.\n''He wanted so much to become a political science professor,'' Ms. Beik said.\nBut trying to work while attending school proved to be more stress than Mr. Kauffman could handle, Ms. Beik said. In 1992, he suffered his most severe psychotic breakdown. He traveled around the country, telling his parents he intended to work on a political campaign. Instead, he spent much of the year homeless, and his medical records show that he was repeatedly admitted to hospitals.\nMr. Kauffman returned home at the end of 1992, but he never completely recovered, Ms. Beik said. He never worked again, and he rarely dated.\nIn 1994, the Social Security Administration deemed him permanently disabled and he began to receive disability payments. He filed for bankruptcy that year. According to the filing, he had $110 in assets -- $50 in cash, a $10 radio and $50 in clothes -- and about $10,000 in debts.\nFrom 1992 to 2000, Mr. Kauffman did not suffer any psychotic breakdowns, according to his mother. During that period, he took lithium, a mood stabilizer commonly prescribed for people with bipolar disorder, and Stelazine, an older antipsychotic drug. With the help of his parents, he moved to an apartment complex that offered subsidized housing.\nBut in late 1999, a psychiatrist switched him from lithium, whichcan cause kidney damage, to Depakote, another mood stabilizer. In early 2000, Mr. Kauffman stopped taking the Depakote, according to his mother.\nAs the year went on, he began to give away his possessions, as he had in previous manic episodes, and became paranoid. During 2000, he was repeatedly hospitalized, once after throwing cans of food out of the window of his sixth-floor apartment.\nIn August, he was institutionalized for a month at a public hospital in Georgia. There he was put on 20 milligrams a day of Zyprexa, a relatively high dose.\nThe Zyprexa, along with the Depakote, which he was still taking, stabilized his illness. But the drugs also left him severely sedated, hardly able to talk, his mother said.\n''He was so tired and he slept so much,'' Ms. Beik said. ''He loved Shakespeare, and he was an avid reader in high school. At the end of his life, it was so sad, he couldn't read a page.''\nIn addition, his health and hygiene deteriorated. In the 1990 newspaper profile, Mr. Kauffman had called himself extremely well-organized. But after 2000, he became slovenly, his mother said. He spent most days in his apartment smoking.\nA therapist who treated Mr. Kauffman while he was taking Zyprexa recalls him as seeming shy and sad. ''He was intelligent enough to have the sense that his life hadn't panned out in a normal fashion,'' the therapist said in an interview. ''He always reminded me of a person standing outside a house with a party going on, looking at it.''\nThe therapist spoke on the condition that her name not be used because of rules covering the confidentiality of discussions with psychiatric patients.\nAs late as 2004, Mr. Kauffman prepared a simple one-page résumé of his spotty work history -- evidence that he perhaps hoped to re-enter the work force. He never did.\nAs Mr. Kauffman's weight increased from 2000 to 2006, he began to suffer from other health problems, including high blood pressure. In December 2005, a doctor ordered him to stop smoking, and he did. But in early 2006, he began to tell his parents that he was having hallucinations of people appearing in his apartment.\nOn March 16, a psychiatrist increased his dose of Zyprexa to 30 milligrams, a very high level.\nThat decision may have been a mistake, doctors say. Ending smoking causes the body to metabolize Zyprexa more slowly, and so Mr. Kauffman might have actually needed a lower rather than higher dose.\nA few days later, Mr. Kauffman spoke to his mother for the last time. By March 26, they had been out of contact for several days. That was unusual, and she feared he might be in trouble. She drove to his apartment building in Decatur the next day and convinced the building's manager to check Mr. Kauffman's apartment. He was dead, his body already beginning to decompose.\nAn autopsy paid for by his mother and conducted by a private forensic pathologist showed he had died of an irregular heartbeat -- probably, the report said, as the result of an enlarged heart caused by his history of high blood pressure.\nMs. Beik acknowledged she cannot be certain that Zyprexa caused her son's death. But the weight gain it produced was most likely a contributing factor, she said. And she is angry that Eli Lilly played down the risks of Zyprexa. The company should have been more honest with doctors, as well as the millions of people who take Zyprexa, she said.\nInstead Lilly has marketed Zyprexa as safer and more effective than older drugs, despite scant evidence, psychiatrists say.\nMs. Beik notes that Stelazine -- an older drug that is no longer widely used even though a federally financed clinical trial showed it works about as well as Zyprexa -- stabilized Mr. Kauffman's illness for eight years without causing him to gain weight.\n''He was on other drugs that worked,'' she said.\nCorrection: January 6, 2007, Saturday A front-page article on Thursday about the side effects of the psychiatric drug Zyprexa misstated the name of a older drug tested against Zyprexa in a federally sponsored clinical trial. It was perphenazine (also called Trilafon), not Stelazine.
1816345	Citing Problems, U.S. Bars Lab From Testing Electronic Voting	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E0D71730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	A laboratory that has tested most of the nation's electronic voting systems has been temporarily barred from approving new machines after federal officials found that it was not following its quality-control procedures and could not document that it was conducting all the required tests.\nThe company, Ciber Inc. of Greenwood Village, Colo., has also come under fire from analysts hired by New York State over its plans to test new voting machines for the state. New York could eventually spend $200 million to replace its aging lever devices.\nExperts on voting systems say the Ciber problems underscore longstanding worries about lax inspections in the secretive world of voting-machine testing. The action by the federal Election Assistance Commission seems certain to fan growing concerns about the reliability and security of the devices.\nThe commission acted last summer, but the problem was not disclosed then. Officials at the commission and Ciber confirmed the action in recent interviews.\nCiber, the largest tester of the nation's voting machine software, says it is fixing its problems and expects to gain certification soon.\nExperts say the deficiencies of the laboratory suggest that crucial features like the vote-counting software and security against hacking may not have been thoroughly tested on many machines now in use.\n''What's scary is that we've been using systems in elections that Ciber had certified, and this calls into question those systems that they tested,'' said Aviel D. Rubin, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins.\nProfessor Rubin said that although some software bugs had shown up quickly, in other instances ''you might have to use the systems for a while before something happens.''\nOfficials at the commission and other election experts said it was essential for a laboratory to follow its quality-control procedures and document all its testing processes to instill confidence in the results.\nCommission officials said that they were evaluating the overall diligence of the laboratory and that they did not try to determine whether its weaknesses had contributed to problems with specific machines.\nComputer scientists have shown that some electronic machines now in use are vulnerable to hacking. Some scientists caution that even a simple software error could affect thousands of votes.\nIn various places, elections have been complicated by machines that did not start, flipped votes from one candidate to another or had trouble tallying the votes.\nUntil recently, the laboratories that test voting software and hardware have operated without federal scrutiny. Even though Washington and the states have spent billions to install the new technologies, the machine manufacturers have always paid for the tests that assess how well they work, and little has been disclosed about any flaws that were discovered.\nAs soon as federal officials began a new oversight program in July, they detected the problems with Ciber. The commission held up its application for interim accreditation, thus barring Ciber from approving new voting systems in most states.\nCiber, a large information technology company, also has a $3 million contract to help New York test proposed systems from six manufacturers. Nystec, a consulting firm in Rome, N.Y., that the state hired, filed a report in late September criticizing Ciber for creating a plan to test the software security that ''did not specify any test methods or procedures for the majority of the requirements.'' The report said the plan did not detail how Ciber would look for bugs in the computer code or check hacking defenses.\nA spokeswoman for Ciber, Diane C. Stoner, said that the company believed that it had addressed all the problems and that it expected to receive its initial federal accreditation this month. Federal officials said they were evaluating the changes the company had made.\nMs. Stoner said in a statement that although the Election Assistance Commission had found deficiencies, they ''were not because Ciber provided incomplete, inaccurate or flawed testing, but because we did not document to the E.A.C.'s liking all of the testing that we were performing.''\nShe added that the test plan cited in New York was just a draft and that Ciber had been working with Nystec to ensure additional security testing.\nThe co-chairman of the New York State Board of Elections, Douglas A. Kellner, said Ciber had tightened its testing. But Mr. Kellner said yesterday that Nystec and Ciber continued to haggle over the scope of the security testing.\nNew York is one of the last states to upgrade its machines, and it also has created some of the strictest standards for them. Mr. Kellner said only two of the six bidders, Diebold Election Systems and Liberty Election Systems, seemed close to meeting all the requirements.\nBesides Ciber, two other companies, SysTest Labs of Denver and Wyle Laboratories, in El Segundo, Calif., test electronic voting machines. Ciber, which has been testing the machines since 1997, checks just software. Wyle examines hardware, and SysTest can look at both.\nThe chairman of the Election Assistance Commission, Paul S. DeGregorio, said SysTest and Wyle received interim accreditations last summer. Mr. DeGregorio said two other laboratories had also applied to enter the field.\nCongress required greater federal oversight when it passed the Help America Vote Act of 2002. Since then, the government also put up more than $3 billion to help states and localities buy electronic machines, to avoid a repeat of the hanging punch-card chads that caused such confusion in the 2000 presidential election.\nThe commission was never given a substantial budget, and it did not finish creating the oversight program until last month. Until then, the laboratories had been at the heart of the system to evaluate voting machines, a system that seemed oddly cobbled together.\nWhile the federal government created standards for the machines, most of the states enacted laws to make them binding. The states also monitored the testing, and much of that work was left to a handful of current and former state election officials who volunteered their time.\nAs a result, voting rights advocates and other critics have long been concerned about potential conflicts of interest, because the manufacturers hire the laboratories and largely try to ensure confidentiality.\nMichael I. Shamos, a computer scientist who examines voting machines for Pennsylvania, said about half had significant defects that the laboratories should have caught.\nBesides certifying the laboratories, the Election Assistance Commission will have three staff members and eight part-time technicians to approve test plans for each system and check the results. The manufacturers will be required to report mechanical breakdowns and botched tallies, and Mr. DeGregorio said those reports would be on the agency's Web site.\nDr. Shamos said, ''This is not the sea change that was needed.''\nHe said he was disappointed that the commission had hired some of the same people involved in the states' monitoring program and that it never announced it had found problems with Ciber operations.\nDr. Rubin of Johns Hopkins said the laboratories should be required to hire teams of hackers to ferret out software vulnerabilities.\nAnd the laboratories will still be paid by the voting machine companies, though a bill now in Congress could change that to government financing.\nA recent appearance in Sarasota, Fla., by the SysTest Labs president, Brian T. Phillips, also raised eyebrows. After a Congressional election in the Sarasota area ended in a recount last month, the victorious Republican candidate hired Mr. Phillips as a consultant to monitor the state's examination of whether there had been a malfunction in the voting machines.\nSeveral critics questioned whether Mr. Phillips should have taken such work, either because of its partisan nature or because it represented such a public defense of the industry.\nMr. Phillips said he did not see any conflict because his laboratory had not tested the software used in Sarasota.

1816348	In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of 'Jihad' Case	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E7D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	In 1997, as the government listened in on their phone call, Adham Hassoun, a computer programmer in Broward County, Fla., proposed a road trip to Jose Padilla, a low-wage worker there. The excursion to Tampa would be his treat, Mr. Hassoun said, and a chance to meet ''some nice, uh, brothers.''\nMr. Padilla, 36, a Brooklyn-born Puerto Rican who had converted to Islam a few years earlier, knew Mr. Hassoun, an outspoken Palestinian, from his mosque. Still, according to a transcript of the conversation obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Padilla equivocated as Mr. Hassoun exhorted.\n''We take the whole family and have a blast,'' Mr. Hassoun said. ''We go to, uh, our Busch Gardens, you know You won't regret it. Money-back guarantee.''\nMr. Padilla, laughing, suggested that they not discuss the matter over the phone.\n''Why?'' Mr. Hassoun said. ''We're going to Busch Gardens. What's the big deal!''\nThat conversation took place five years before Mr. Padilla, a United States citizen accused of plotting a ''dirty bomb'' attack against this country, was declared an enemy combatant. Given that Mr. Padilla and Mr. Hassoun are now criminal defendants in a terrorism conspiracy case in Miami, it sounds suspicious, as if Mr. Hassoun were proposing something more sinister than a weekend at the amusement park. He well may have been -- but maybe, too, he was sincere or joking about a Muslim retreat.\nDeciphering such chatter in order to construct a convincing narrative of conspiracy is a challenge. Yet, prosecutors say, the government will rely largely on wiretapped conversations when it puts Mr. Padilla, Mr. Hassoun, and a third defendant, Kifah Jayyousi, on trial as a ''North American support cell'' that sent money, goods and recruits abroad to assist ''global jihad.''\nTens of thousands of conversations were recorded. Some 230 phone calls form the core of the government's case, including 21 that make reference to Mr. Padilla, prosecutors said. But Mr. Padilla's voice is heard on only seven calls. And on those seven, which The Times obtained from a participant in the case, Mr. Padilla does not discuss violent plots.\nBut this is not the version of Mr. Padilla -- Al Qaeda associate and would-be bomber -- that John Ashcroft, then the attorney general, unveiled in 2002 when he interrupted a trip to Moscow to trumpet Mr. Padilla's capture. In the four and a half years since then, as the government tested the limits of its power to deal with terrorism outside the traditional law enforcement system, Mr. Padilla is the only accused terrorist to have gone from enemy combatant to criminal defendant.\nHis criminal trial, scheduled to begin late this month, will feature none of the initial claims about violent plotting with Al Qaeda that the government cited as justification for detaining Mr. Padilla without formal charges for three and a half years. Those claims came from the government's overseas interrogations of terrorism suspects, like Abu Zubaydah, which, the government said, Mr. Padilla corroborated, in part, during his own questioning in a military brig in South Carolina.\nBut, constrained by strict federal rules of evidence that would prohibit or limit the use of information obtained during such interrogations, the government will make a far more circumscribed case against Mr. Padilla in court, effectively demoting him from Al Qaeda's dirty bomber to foot soldier in a somewhat nebulous conspiracy.\nThe initial dirty bomb accusation did not disappear. It quietly resurfaced in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The government filed the dirty bomb charges against Mr. Padilla's supposed accomplice, an Ethiopian-born detainee, at about the same time it indicted Mr. Padilla on relatively lesser offenses in criminal court.\nA Change in Strategy\nThe change in Mr. Padilla's status, from enemy combatant to criminal defendant, was abrupt. It came late in 2005 as the Supreme Court was weighing whether to take up the legality of his military detention and the Bush administration, by filing criminal charges, pre-empted its review. In a way, Mr. Padilla's prosecution was a legal maneuver that kept the issue of his detention without charges out of the Supreme Court. After apprehending him at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in May 2002, the Bush administration made a choice: to detain Mr. Padilla militarily, in order to thwart further plotting, rather than to follow him in order to gather evidence that might serve a criminal prosecution.\nNow that Mr. Padilla has ended up a criminal defendant after all, the prosecution's case does not fully reflect the Bush administration's view of who he is or what he did.\nSenior government officials have said publicly that Mr. Padilla provided self-incriminating information during interrogations, admitting, they said, to undergoing basic terrorist training, to accepting an assignment to blow up apartment buildings in the United States, and to attending a farewell dinner with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the suspected master planner of the Sept. 11 attacks, before he flew to Chicago in 2002.\nBut any confessions by Mr. Padilla while he was detained without charges and denied access to counsel -- whether or not he was mistreated, as his lawyers claim -- would not be admissible in court.\nAnd it is unlikely that information obtained during the harsh questioning of Al Qaeda detainees would be admissible, either -- and, further, the government is disinclined to expose sensitive intelligence or invite further scrutiny of secret jails overseas.\nProbably as a consequence, the current criminal case zeroes in on what the government sees as an earlier stage of Mr. Padilla's involvement with terrorism. It focuses primarily on the other defendants' support during the 1990s for Muslim struggles overseas, especially in Bosnia, Kosovo and Chechnya. Mr. Padilla, who was appended to their pre-existing case, in which he had been an unnamed co-conspirator, is depicted as their recruit.\nAlthough prosecutors have declined to discuss the government's strategy, their filings and statements in court provide a picture of the case they are expected to present at trial.\nThe most tangible allegation against Mr. Padilla is that in 2000 he filled out, under an alias, an Arab-language application to attend a terrorist training camp. That application is expected to be offered into evidence alongside the wiretapped conversations, but Mr. Padilla's lawyers say they will contest its admissibility, challenging the government's assertion that the ''mujahideen data form'' belonged to their client.\nRobert Chesney, a specialist in national security law at Wake Forest University, called the prosecution a pragmatic one, analogous to ''going after Al Capone on tax evasion.''\nBut Deborah Pearlstein, a lawyer with Human Rights First who has consulted with Mr. Padilla's defense, said that his will never be an ordinary, pragmatic prosecution. ''If Jose Padilla were from Day 1 just charged and tried, then maybe,'' she said. ''But this is a case that comes after three and a half years of the most gross deprivation of human rights that we've seen in this country for a long time.''\nFurther, Ms. Pearlstein noted, the government has reserved the option, should the prosecution fail, of returning Mr. Padilla to the military brig. This, she said, ''casts a shadow'' over the current prosecution.\nThe Bush administration's military case against Binyam Mohamed, 28, the Ethiopian detainee at Guantánamo, put the current proceedings in a different light, too.\nIn December 2005, Mr. Mohamed was referred to the military commission in Guantánamo on accusations that he conspired with Mr. Padilla on the dirty bomb plot. It was little noticed at the time.\nBut accusations against Mr. Padilla that are nowhere to be found in the indictment against him filled the pages of Mr. Mohamed's charging sheet, with Mr. Padilla repeatedly identified by name. The sheet referred to the two men meeting in Pakistan after Sept. 11, 2001, studying how to build an improvised dirty bomb, discussing the feasibility of a dirty bomb attack with Al Qaeda officials and agreeing to undertake the mission to blow up buildings.\nMr. Mohamed's lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said that these charges were based on a forced confession by Mr. Mohamed, who, he said, was tortured overseas into admitting to a story that was fed to him. ''Binyam was told all along that his job was to be a witness against Padilla, Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed,'' Mr. Stafford Smith said, adding that his client ''has no conscience knowledge that he ever met'' Mr. Padilla.\nThe charges against Mr. Mohamed and other Guantánamo detainees who were headed for prosecution there have been suspended temporarily as a result of the Military Commissions Act passed by Congress in October. Those charges are likely to be reinstated, a Pentagon official said yesterday.\nThat Mr. Mohamed faced dirty bomb charges and Mr. Padilla does not speaks to the central difference between being a terrorism suspect in Guantánamo and a criminal defendant charged with terrorism offenses in the United States.\nIn Guantánamo, the military commission system that deals with foreign-born terrorism suspects is expected to allow, with some exceptions, the use of information obtained through coercion.\n''Federal court rules are restrictive,'' Professor Chesney of Wake Forest University School of Law said. ''The very essence of why they're trying to have that separate military system was to create rules to use information that is deemed by the intelligence community to be trustworthy but wouldn't make it under the federal rules of evidence.''\nDavid Cole, a professor of law at Georgetown University and author of books on terrorism and civil liberties, sees the difference between the two systems more critically: ''What this says clearly is that they feel that they can get away with using tainted evidence in the military commission system that they can't use in the criminal court system.''\nThe Wiretapping Case\nThe criminal case against Mr. Padilla has its roots in the prosecution of Sheikh Omer Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who was convicted in 1995 of conspiring to blow up the United Nations and other New York landmarks.\nIn the early 1990s, Sheikh Rahman's telephone was tapped, and Mr. Hassoun and Dr. Jayyousi, a Jordanian-born American citizen who holds a doctorate in civil engineering, came to the government's attention through phone calls to or from his line. Then the government, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, began to eavesdrop on them, which eventually pulled Mr. Padilla into their net, too.\nThe government presents the three defendants as ''joined at the hip,'' as one prosecutor put it in a hearing last summer. But Judge Marcia G. Cooke of Federal District Court, noting that Mr. Padilla was appended to a case well under way, asked the government, ''If they are so joined at the hip, why is Mr. Padilla so late to the dance?''\nDr. Jayyousi, a former school system administrator in both Detroit and Washington, D.C., never met Mr. Padilla, his lawyer, William Swor, said.\nIt is Mr. Hassoun, the government said, who recruited Mr. Padilla. But both Mr. Hassoun's and Mr. Padilla's lawyers deny that Mr. Padilla was recruited.\nSeven Taped Phone Calls\nMr. Padilla's lawyers and relatives say that he left South Florida for Egypt in September 1998 on a spiritual journey. A former juvenile offender, he converted to Islam as part of an effort to straighten out his life, they say. His mosque in Fort Lauderdale sponsored his travel, he told friends, relatives and F.B.I. agents who interviewed him in 2002. Mr. Hassoun belonged to that mosque, and the telephone transcripts seem to indicate that Mr. Hassoun helped, at the least, with Mr. Padilla's travel plans.\nThe seven taped phone calls that bear Mr. Padilla's voice involve conversations with Mr. Hassoun from 1997 to 2000.\nOn those calls, Mr. Padilla, unlike some of the other defendants, does not employ what the government says is coded language. According to the government, other defendants refer to their jihad-related plans as ''getting some fresh air,'' ''participating in tourism,'' ''opening up a market,'' ''playing football,'' and so on. This leads to silly-sounding exchanges where ''the brothers'' discuss going on ''picnics'' in order ''to smell fresh air and to eat cheese'' or using $3,500 to buy ''zucchini.''\nIn contrast, Mr. Padilla's seven conversations with Mr. Hassoun range from straightforward -- Mr. Hassoun tells Mr. Padilla that his grandmother has died; Mr. Padilla tells Mr. Hassoun that he has found himself an 18-year-old Egyptian bride who is willing to wear a veil -- to vaguely suggestive or just odd.\nIn one phone call, the two men talked about a dream. It appeared to be the dream that Mr. Padilla, according to his relatives, cites as having played a crucial role in inspiring him to convert to Islam: the vision of a man in a turban, surrounded by the swirling dust of a desert.\nMr. Hassoun brought it up and told Mr. Padilla that he himself had experienced the same vision. ''What do you mean you saw the same dream?'' Mr. Padilla asked.\n''I saw the dream of the uh person with the turban,'' Mr. Hassoun said.\nMr. Hassoun explained how, in his dream, the turban was wrongly wrapped and so he thought the man might be a spy, in which case, he was prepared ''to split his body apart.'' But then, he said, he understood that ''the brother was a good one.''\n''Yeah?'' Mr. Padilla said.\nIn three of the seven conversations, Mr. Padilla made statements that the government has identified as ''overt acts'' in furtherance of the accused conspiracy.\nIn the first, Mr. Hassoun asked, ''You're ready, right?'' and Mr. Padilla said, ''God willing, brother, it's going to happen soon.'' That was the summer of 1997, a year before Mr. Padilla left South Florida for Egypt.\nIn the second, Mr. Padilla told Mr. Hassoun, during a 1999 conversation from Egypt, that he had asked his ex-wife in the United States to arrange for him to receive an army jacket, a book bag and a sleeping bag, supplies that he had requested because ''there was a rumor here that the door was open somewhere.'' In the third, Mr. Padilla told Mr. Hassoun in April 2000, that he would need a recommendation to ''connect me with the good brothers, with the right faith'' if he were to travel to Yemen.\nProsecutors say Mr. Padilla is mentioned, although by his Muslim name Ibrahim or by another alias, on 21 additional tapes. One of them refers to Ibrahim as being ''in the area of Usama,'' which the government takes to mean that he was near Osama bin Laden. But Mr. Padilla's lawyers contest that interpretation.\n''That is just nonsensical, Your Honor, that these men who for years, according to the government, have been talking in code all of a sudden are going to throw Osama bin Laden's name around,'' Michael Caruso, a federal public defender, said in court.\nMr. Padilla has pleaded not guilty. But before his case goes before a jury, his fitness to stand trial will be evaluated. On the basis of Mr. Padilla's lawyers' assertion that he is mentally damaged as a result of his prolonged isolation and his interrogation in the brig, Judge Cooke has ordered a psychiatric evaluation by a Bureau of Prisons doctor to be completed this week.\nFriday in The Times: The only person on the American mainland still held asan enemy combatant.\nCorrection: January 5, 2007, Friday A front-page article yesterday about wiretapped conversations in the case against Jose Padilla, who is accused of plotting a ''dirty bomb'' attack, omitted two lines at the continuation in some copies. The sentence should have read: ''In the four and a half years since then, as the government tested the limits of its power to deal with terrorism outside the traditional law enforcement system, Mr. Padilla is the only accused terrorist to have gone from enemy combatant to criminal defendant.''

The statement by Ms. Walters, far right with Ms. O'Donnell, appeared to be her attempt to prevent further flare-ups to the simmering feud between Mr. Trump and Ms. O'Donnell, which began last month when Ms. O'Donnell poked fun at him for his reprimand of the current Miss USA, Tara Conner, for her public partying. Ms. O'Donnell was on vacation and not on the show yesterday, but Ms. Walters said she would welcome her back next week, adding that she never told Mr. Trump she did not want Ms. O'Donnell on the show. ''Nothing could be further from the truth,'' Ms. Walters said. ''I have never regretted nor do I now regret hiring Rosie O'Donnell,'' who ''has brought a new vitality to this show.'' Ms. Walters also read a statement clarifying Ms. O'Donnell's remarks last month that Mr. Trump has ''been bankrupt so many times.'' Ms. Walters noted that Mr. Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, although ''several of his casino companies have filed for business bankruptcies'' and are ''out of bankruptcy now.''\nEDWARD WYATT

According to Nielsen's estimate, NBC's ''Law & Order: Criminal Intent'' garnered 13.4 million viewers at 9 p.m., the show's largest audience in more than a year. NBC also dominated the 10 p.m. hour with ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' (15.1 million), which drew the night's highest ratings. NBC's ''Dateline'' (9.5 million) ranked second in the 8 p.m. hour. Meanwhile Orange Bowl coverage of Louisville's win over Wake Forest appeared to give Fox an edge over CBS for No. 2 for the night. The game averaged 10.6 million viewers according to time-zone adjusted estimates. CBS received relatively strong ratings for repeats of ''NCIS'' at 8 (13 million) and ''The Unit'' at 9 (9.1 million), but a rerun of ''Numb3rs,'' which is usually broadcast on Fridays, earned 6.7 million viewers at 10. ABC finished fourth with repeats of ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' at 8 (8.1 million) and ''Boston Legal'' at 10 (5 million), as well as two new episodes of ''Big Day'' at 9 (5.2 million) and 9:30 (4.8 million).\nBENJAMIN TOFF

''The New Year brings with it a focus on the fund to help solve the immediate crisis of the tower and spire,'' said the fund-raisers, Friends of Shakespeare's Church. The building is the Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-on-Avon, where Shakespeare was baptized, worshiped with his family and was buried in the chancel in 1616.

''Thanks to the new Acropolis Museum, we were able to conduct the biggest ever dig within the walls of Athens's ancient city,'' said Stamatia Eleftheratou, an archaeologist. The finds, amid the ruins of villas, workshops, bathhouses, courtyards and networks of sewers, also include cooking utensils, children's games and figurines of little-known deities. The decision to build the $183 million museum on an archaeologically rich site was criticized, but it allowed for a dig in a densely settled area of ancient Athens. The bust of Aristotle, with an aquiline nose, protruding forehead, floppy hair and minute eyes and mouth, is a Roman copy of a fourth-century B.C. original. Alkestis Choremi, the former director of the Athens department of prehistoric and classical antiquities, said: ''This comes closer to resembling him than anything ever discovered here.

Rock, punk and rave will illustrate hell, and purgatory will be evoked through Gregorian chant; heaven reportedly will be depicted through classical-style melody.\nLithuanian Court Allows 'Popetown' Broadcast\nA Lithuanian court cleared the way for the start yesterday of telecasts of the irreverent cartoon series ''Popetown'' by rejecting a petition by the Lithuanian Bishops' Conference to ban the series as a mockery of the Roman Catholic Church and clergy and an incitement of hatred, according to MTV, Agence France-Presse reported. Ema Segal, a spokeswoman for MTV Lietuva, said the court rejected the request, ''saying it found no evidence to confirm any threat to the church.'' She added, ''We are happy that the court once again confirmed that media in Lithuania are free.'' The ''Popetown'' Web site (popetown.com) says the cartoon takes the viewer into the ''surreal world of the Vatican as the long-suffering and good-hearted Father Nicholas struggles to walk the narrow path of righteousness, whilst surrounded by money grabbing cardinals and a pogo-stick-riding infantile pope.''\nFootnotes\nSamy Nacéri, below, the French actor who stars in the critically acclaimed film ''Days of Glory,'' was in police custody yesterday on a charge of attempted murder. Mr. Nacéri, 45, was arrested in Aix-en-Provence, where he was accused of pulling a knife on a nightclub doorman. In December, he was sentenced to six months in prison for racial abuse of a black police officer.

1816363	Home Depot Board Ousts Chief, Saying Goodbye With Big Check	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	In May, in a nearly empty basement ballroom at the Hotel du Pont in Wilmington, Del., Robert L. Nardelli, the chairman and chief executive of Home Depot, stood between huge timers, intended to limit questions from the handful of shareholders present. After dismissing questions about his compensation or the independence of the board, Mr. Nardelli abruptly ended the meeting after only 30 minutes.\nTime ran out on Mr. Nardelli on Tuesday, after the board, at a hastily arranged meeting, decided that he should go -- with a $210 million exit package.\nIt was a surprising turnaround for Home Depot's board, which had publicly supported Mr. Nardelli as recently as two weeks ago even as questions about his compensation, business strategy and autocratic management style mounted.\nWhat ultimately divided the board and its chief executive appeared to have been Mr. Nardelli's compensation. Over six years as chief executive, he had taken home $64 million and was on track to earn hundreds of millions more. In recent months, people close to the board say, directors sought to rein in the compensation under the terms of his current contract. Mr. Nardelli, these people said, had challenged that effort.\n''He was brought down by his compensation,'' a person close to the board said. ''It was an erosion of relationships over several months. He lost the confidence of the board.''\nIn the end, the debate over cutting Mr. Nardelli's pay may not have revolved around large numbers. It would have been possible, for example, for the board to give Mr. Nardelli a minimum bonus of $3 million under the terms of his contract, rather than the $7 million he received in 2005.\nA director, however, speaking on the condition of anonymity, insisted that compensation was not the reason for Mr. Nardelli's departure and that there was no ''smoking gun'' behind his resignation.\nThe fall of Mr. Nardelli is the latest illustration of chief executives and boards coming under pressure when rich executive pay yields few apparent returns in the form of a rising stock price or improving profits. Outsize executive pay has increasingly become a flash point for investors, lawmakers and regulators.\nStill, critics of executive pay practices were incensed by Mr. Nardelli's gold-plated exit, the terms of which were largely laid out in his 2000 contract. The pay package includes severance and retirement pay, restricted stock, stock options and other forms of deferred compensation.\nThe package is ''further confirmation of the need to deal with a pattern of C.E.O. pay that appears to be out of control,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who will be chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.\nWhen he was hired, Mr. Nardelli was a prized former manager under John F. Welch Jr. at General Electric, running its $15 billion power systems division. Since he became chief executive, however, Home Depot's stock price has languished and the company has lost market share to its chief rival, Lowe's.\nBut the seeds of Mr. Nardelli's ouster were sown that day in May, according to several people close to the board. The angry outcry over how Mr. Nardelli conducted the annual meeting was compounded by the humiliation board members felt because they had been persuaded to stay away from the May meeting, departing from usual practice.\nThat discontent grew in recent months as large shareholders threatened a revolt at Home Depot's annual meeting this spring.\nYesterday, Home Depot, the nation's largest home-improvement chain, named Frank Blake as its new chairman and chief executive. Mr. Blake, another former General Electric executive, joined Home Depot in 2002 and helped develop business strategy at the company.\nMr. Blake already appears to be distancing himself from Mr. Nardelli and his rigid style. In an address to Home Depot employees over an internal television system yesterday, Mr. Blake advised them to ''lighten up'' and ''have fun again,'' according to one worker.\nMr. Blake's current employment agreement is in force, Home Depot said, and the board is working out details of a new employment contract.\nShares of Home Depot rose 2.3 percent, or 91 cents, to $41.07 yesterday.\nMessages for Mr. Nardelli were not returned yesterday.\nFor Kenneth G. Langone, a director and co-founder of Home Depot, Mr. Nardelli's resignation carries a particular sting. A onetime member of the G.E. board, Mr. Langone played an instrumental role in bringing Mr. Nardelli to Home Depot. And when it became clear that Mr. Nardelli would come aboard only as chief executive, he persuaded his old friend, Arthur Blank, then the chief executive, to step aside.\nMr. Nardelli was the first chief executive plucked from outside of Home Depot since its founding in 1978. He immediately drew fire over his lack of retail experience.\nInside the company, his hands-on, severe management style rubbed against a more casual culture that gave store managers autonomy.\nBy contrast, Mr. Nardelli was an obsessive workaholic who rose at 4 a.m., logged 14-hour days and routinely worked through the weekend, splitting his time between Home Depot's headquarters in Atlanta and shuttling from store-to-store in a chauffeured black Chevy Suburban.\nHe earned the nickname ''general'' -- and, as if to underscore the point, he hired dozens of former military officers to run stores, a recruitment strategy he introduced at G.E.\nMr. Nardelli never won over the chain's store managers, current and former company executives said. After touring stores, he frequently inflamed managers by sending critical e-mail messages about cluttered aisles and poorly lighted displays.\nThe result was a high level of manager turnover. In the last 18 months, three senior merchandise executives -- Tom Taylor, John Costello and Carl C. Liebert III -- left the company, leaving Mr. Nardelli with very few experienced retail executives in his top ranks.\n''The long-term retailers never felt he integrated himself into the retailing piece of the business,'' said Harold Reiter, chairman and chief executive with Herbert Mines Associates, an executive recruitment firm.\nOutside of the company, many shareholders, angry at how the annual meeting in May was conducted, struggled to embrace the bold strategic course Mr. Nardelli was setting for Home Depot that steered it further away from its bread-and-butter business of selling hammers and nails to consumers.\nFor instance, Mr. Nardelli was betting big on Home Depot Supply, a new unit that supplied professional contractors with lumber, cement and pipes. He spent $7 billion in recent years to buy about 40 companies, turning Home Depot Supply into a $12 billion business, whose sales now account for 13 percent of the company's $90 billion in revenue.\nMr. Nardelli also planned to move aggressively overseas, particularly into China, where the company acquired a retail chain in December.\nDuring his tenure, Home Depot doubled its sales and sharply increased its earnings per share.\nYet while the board backed his vision for the company, shareholders were less enthused. The stock has barely budged over his tenure.\nBecause of that lackluster performance, critics sought to make Mr. Nardelli Exhibit A for chief executives who receive millions and millions of dollars in pay for weak performance.\nMany of those critics took aim at Home Depot's board, which they argued was cozy and tight-knit, with close ties between one another and with G.E. Sitting at the center of Home Depot's board is Mr. Langone, who has been the longstanding chairmanof the board's nominating committee and who some critics say has loaded up the board with many of his friends and former business associates. A proponent of paying chief executives well for their performance, Mr. Langone has long supported Mr. Nardelli's generous contract.\nAs chairman of the compensation committee at the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Langone also signed off on Richard A. Grasso's largest pay days as chairman and he remains embroiled in a civil suit over Mr. Grasso's $139.5 million pay package.\nMr. Langone did not return calls for comment.\nThe lawyer who represented the New York exchange was the same lawyer who represented the board of Home Depot: Martin Lipton, the takeover lawyer who founded Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.\nMr. Lipton, a longtime friend of Mr. Langone, was originally hired to help defend Mr. Nardelli and the board against Relational Investors, an owner of Home Depot shares that has challenged Mr. Nardelli's strategies in regulatory filings. Mr. Lipton has often found himself in the middle of sticky situations where the chief executive is ousted and paid an enormous golden parachute. Mr. Lipton also worked for Morgan Stanley's board when Phillip Purcell was fired. He did the same for Disney when Michael D. Eisner was terminated. While many of Home Depot's critics were elated that Mr. Nardelli was leaving the company, they expressed shock at the size of his departure pay package.\n''We're aghast at the level of compensation that Nardelli is walking away with -- this is money directly out of shareholders' pockets,'' said Richard Ferlauto, the director of pension investment policy for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, whose pension fund owns shares in the company.\nFurthermore, if Home Depot is trying to distance itself from Mr. Nardelli, Mr. Blake is a strange choice, some Wall Street analysts said. Like Mr. Nardelli, Mr. Blake has little retail experience. He spent much of his career at G.E. and helped develop the Home Depot supply business.\n''There will be some pushback to his appointment,'' said Stephen C. Chick, an analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities.\nAnalysts said the performance of Home Depot's retail business, which has lagged behind that of its main rival, Lowe's, for several years, lay at the heart of Mr. Nardelli's troubles.\nMr. Nardelli's original strategy of sharply cutting costs -- by reducing employees' hours and hiring more part-timers -- alienated loyal customers, who relied on experienced store staff for advice.\n''Home Depot was managing the company for Wall Street's earnings expectations and that came at the expense of the investment needed in their retail business,'' Mr. Chick said.\nMr. Nardelli ''has to take the blame for that,'' Mr. Chick said.\nFar from cooling down shareholders angry over Mr. Nardelli's pay and other corporate governance issues, Mr. Nardelli's departure seems to have instead inflamed them.\n''It's not enough to shuffle the deck chairs; they haven't changed their strategy and there isn't any fresh blood on the board,'' said Ralph Whitworth, who heads Relational Investors, which owns about $1 billion of Home Depot's stock, or about a 1.2 percent stake.\nAbout three weeks ago, Mr. Whitworth notified Mr. Nardelli in a letter that he was intending to call on shareholders to create a committee to study Home Depot's direction and performance and planned to submit at least two candidates for the board.\nYesterday, Mr. Whitworth said those plans had not changed.\n''There's clearly some big, big corporate governance issues here and I don't expect that to change without fresh blood on the board,'' he said.\nA CHAIRMAN'S FALL\nCorrection: January 6, 2007, Saturday A picture in Business Day on Thursday of the home of Robert L. Nardelli, who was ousted as chairman and chief executive of Home Depot, carried an incorrect credit. It was by Chris Rank of Bloomberg News, not by Home Depot.
1816364	Ethics Overhaul Tops the Agenda as the Democrats Take Over	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	On the brink of regaining power after 12 years, House Democrats said Wednesday that they would move immediately to try to sever ties between lawmakers and lobbyists who figured into scandals that helped Democrats win control of Congress.\nDemocrats, who campaigned relentlessly last year on the theme of a Republican culture of corruption, introduced the proposed ethics rules as part of a week of choreography designed to deliver the message that they did not intend to do business as usual in Washington. In some cases, like restrictions on the use of corporate jets, the rules on gifts and travel by lobbyists go further than what Democrats had pledged earlier.\nAnother part of the Democrats' package called for detailed disclosure of pet projects or special-interest tax benefits that individual lawmakers insert into major bills. On Wednesday, President Bush jumped into the debate on such spending projects, called earmarks, urging that their number and cost be cut in half this year, a proposal that Democrats immediately rejected.\nThe ethics issue continued to reverberate Wednesday, officially the last day of Republican control. Two House Republicans, Representative Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania and Tom Feeney of Florida, agreed to pay for trips that the ethics committee determined had been improperly paid for by outside interests.\nMr. Feeney's case involved a $5,640 trip to Scotland originally paid for by Jack Abramoff, the now-imprisoned lobbyist who was at the center of the Congressional corruption scandals. Mr. Weldon, who was defeated for re-election, will pay $23,000 for an undisclosed trip.\nThe rules changes would also take aim at the so-called K Street Project, the effort associated with the hardball tactics of the former Republican leader Tom DeLay, to pressure trade groups and lobbying firms to hire Republicans or face the legislative consequences. The proposal would prohibit lawmakers and staff members from trying to exert partisan influence on hiring decisions.\n''I think this package is more than a good-faith effort,'' said Meredith McGehee, policy director of the Campaign Legal Center, an ethics group. Referring to the incoming House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Ms. McGehee said, ''If these rule changes are any indication, she is serious.''\nBut the ethics rules do not address the most valuable gifts that come from lobbyists and others interested in legislation: campaign donations. And the Democratic Party's fund-raising machine -- revved up by the advantages of being in the majority -- continued apace this week with individual members inviting lobbyists and other contributors to a host of events.\nOn Thursday night, Mrs. Pelosi is having a $1,000-a-head fund-raiser with performances by Tony Bennett, Carole King, Wyclef Jean and the surviving members of the Grateful Dead. ''Ms. Pelosi is a huge Dead fan,'' her spokeswoman said.\nSenator Richard J. Durbin was among those who stopped by a reception Wednesday evening for a fellow Illinois Democrat, Representative Melissa Bean, who won a close and expensive re-election race in November. The reception, at Johnny's Half Shell, a restaurant on Capitol Hill popular with lobbyists and lawmakers, drew lobbyists from both parties.\nAs they prepared for the pomp and festivities that will mark the Capitol Hill power switch, Democrats got a taste of the potential difficulties of governing with thin majorities in the House and Senate as well as a Republican White House and a presidential election two years off.\nWhile Democrats sought to introduce their ethics legislation at a news conference, the antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan and others interrupted with chants of ''Troops home now; de-escalate, investigate.'' The scene vividly illustrated the pressure that Democrats will face from the left wing of their party to challenge President Bush more aggressively on Iraq. Ms. Sheehan and other antiwar advocates felt they contributed to the Democrats' takeover of Congress.\nAt the same time, Republicans made clear they intend to hold Democrats accountable for their pledge to allow more minority party participation in legislation. They assailed Democrats' plans to push through major legislation right away without allowing Republican alternatives. Though the Republicans severely limited Democrats' input when they were in charge, they rejected accusations that they were hypocritical.\n''The important point here is that the American people were promised a new way of doing business in the United States Congress,'' said Representative Adam H. Putnam of Florida, chairman of the House Republican Conference.\nRepresentative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the new majority leader, said Republicans would get their chance after Democrats disposed of legislation on national security, minimum wage, prescription drug costs, stem cell research, student loan costs and energy.\n''We said to the American people, 'If you elect us, if you put us in charge, this is what we are going to do and we are going to do it in the first 100 hours,' '' Mr. Hoyer told reporters.\nDemocrats were dogged by technical difficulties when a changeover in House Web sites delayed the formal posting of their ethics proposal.\nThe Senate will convene Thursday as well, with Democrats and Republicans meeting first in an unofficial closed-door session in the old Senate chambers to try to find some common ground. Aides said the Senate was going to take up its own ethics package next week, allowing a week or more of floor debate to shape legislation.\nBesides the rules barring lawmakers from accepting gifts, meals or trips from lobbyists or the organizations that employ them, the House Democratic plan would also require preapproval from the Ethics Committee for any trips paid for by other outside groups aside from educational institutions.\nOn the subject of corporate jets, Democrats had previously discussed raising the rate at which lawmakers reimburse corporations or other sponsors for flights, but still allowing use of the jets. But the rules proposed Wednesday would bar lawmakers from any use of corporate jets.\nPrevious Democratic and Republican proposals about shedding light on earmarks, the pet projects lawmakers insert into major spending bills, left large loopholes, particularly in regard to military contracts.\nIn contrast, the new rules appear to apply to all spending earmarks as well as tax or tariff provisions that benefit fewer than 10 companies or people. They would also require disclosure of such items in each bill as well as the individual sponsors.\nThe rules would further require each House member requesting an earmark or limited tax provision to certify that he or she would not profit from the provision.\nDemocratic leaders also said that in February they would take up potential new restrictions on members of Congress and staff members becoming lobbyists, and that in March they would consider creating an outside panel to enforce the ethics rules -- a step that lawmakers of both parties have resisted.\nPresident Bush called for the Democrats to adopt even more drastic restrictions on earmarks, a perennial bane to executive branch officials who resent Congressional meddling in their budgets.\n''One important message we all should take from the elections is that people want to end the secretive process by which Washington insiders are able to get billions of dollars directed to projects, many of them pork barrel projects that have never been reviewed or voted on by the Congress,'' Mr. Bush said. He called on Democrats to require ''full disclosure'' of ''the costs, the recipients, and the justifications for every earmark'' as well as sponsors.\nTHE 110TH CONGRESS
1816365	Where Up Is Still Down, But the Rest Is Changing	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E5D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	There were comparisons to ''Alice in Wonderland,'' ''Star Trek,'' ''The Twilight Zone,'' and all manner of clichés to convey the strangeness engulfing Washington this week as the Democrats prepared to assume control of Congress after 12 years in the minority wilderness. But nothing distilled the new aura of things like this conceit: Steny Hoyer, Rock Star.\n''Here he comes, here he comes,'' a member of the press throng effervesced when Mr. Hoyer of Maryland, the incoming House majority leader, strode into the room as if he owned the place. Which, in effect, he does -- at least the larger, plusher office he is inheriting, which used to belong to Tom DeLay, Mr. Hoyer was compelled to point out. (Not that anyone's keeping track.)\nMr. Hoyer surveyed the conference room and held his arms slightly apart, as if to frame the unusual site before him: a crush of 60 or so reporters, camera operators, TV types and assorted security people, staff members and hangers-on to befit the status of an emerging fuss magnet.\nThe fussers were present for Mr. Hoyer's ''pen and pad'' briefing, and in considerably greater numbers than during his days in the minority.\n''We're going to reserve some seats for those who came to these pen and pads when I was irrelevant,'' Mr. Hoyer said, a line he had deployed before, but which served the recurring purpose of marking the juxtaposition of fortunes that are on full display in the up-is-down realm of Capitol Hill. ''There are some who think I'm still irrelevant,'' he added, not proffering guesses.\nMr. Hoyer wore a shiny white dress shirt, a red power tie and an occasional look of stunned confusion. To his right, movers passed the window, carrying lamps and tables. Mr. Hoyer was hard to decipher at times, speaking in the mumble of someone accustomed to smaller audiences.\n'It's Not Whining'\nNot so the Republicans convened upstairs. Waving his hands and stomping his feet, Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina acted out on Wednesday what the rest of the Republican caucus must have felt. ''It is so hypocritical, just on its face,'' Mr. McHenry fumed.\nHis complaint: That Democrats, on the verge of taking control of Congress, were planning to run the place their way, driving the legislative agenda themselves without input from the Republican minority.\nWasn't that, someone asked, how the Republicans had run Congress for more than a decade?\n''We didn't campaign on this openness,'' Mr. McHenry argued, denying that he and his colleagues were just being sore losers. ''It's not whining,'' he said. ''It's a matter of calling them out on their rhetoric.''\nDemocrats had not even taken over yet. But Republicans, suddenly facing a minimum two-year sentence out of power, coalesced around a message of kvetching.\nThey held up reports that Democrats would conduct their first 100 hours without allowing Republican amendments. They held news conferences to deplore the new regime, citing letters from Mrs. Pelosi from when she was in the minority, requesting a piece of the legislative action.\n''There are lots of messages that came across in this November election, and one of the messages was change in doing things differently,'' said Representative Kay Granger, Republican of Texas.\nWatch for Falling Marble\nAcross town, Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut presided over an afternoon tea that brought together Democratic women for what she described as ''our understated way of saying we've arrived.''\nBut as with much of the week's festivities, there was nothing understated about whom the celebration was for: a giant photograph of the incoming speaker, Nancy Pelosi, was on a screen at the front of the room, alongside one of Ann Richards, the first woman to be governor of Texas, who died in September.\nWhen Mrs. Pelosi takes the gavel, Ms. DeLauro said, ''The sound you hear will be the glass ceiling in this country, and the marble ceiling in this institution, shattering.''\nDrop the Pacifier and Smile\n''Who is that guy?'' a staffer asked, pointing to a big-shotty looking man with a small entourage in the Cannon office building. Must be a new member, he concluded.\nNope, it was Paul Pelosi, the new speaker's husband, leading members of the first family of Congress to get ID card photographs.\nThis included Paul Michael Vos, the 6-week-old grandson of the speaker and Mr. Pelosi and the son of the filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, whose HBO documentary ''Journeys with George'' chronicled George W. Bush's first presidential campaign.\nPaul's birth nearly conflicted with Grandma Pelosi's last-minute campaign plans, but he had the good sense not to go off message and showed up after Election Day.\nAnd yes, newborns require photo ID's on Capitol Hill. His father, Michiel Vos, dutifully carried his son into the room marked ''ID services.'' Fifteen minutes later, he emerged crying (the baby, not the father), but with a shiny new photo ID clipped to his adorable onesie.\nHello, but First, This Protest\nDown the hallway, Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois was starting to address another news media mob that had waited for him to emerge from a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus. Mr. Emanuel wished everyone a happy new year, apologized for being late and was promptly drowned out by a group of antiwar protesters, led by the ubiquitous Cindy Sheehan.\n''De-escalate, investigate,'' the group chanted. ''Troops home now.''\nMr. Emanuel and Mr. Hoyer decided to leave their podium and return later. ''Looks like we're taking a little break,'' Mr. Hoyer said as he and Mr. Emmanuel rushed away.\nMs. Sheehan was happy to take over the microphone, not to mention the lingering throng of reporters.\nShe called for a greater role for the peace movement in the Democratic majority, which she said was ignoring the people who put them in power -- the peace movement. She called for an end to financing the war.\n''And these are not requests,'' said Ms. Sheehan, whose son Casey was killed in Iraq. ''These are demands.''\nMs. Sheehan vowed to stay around all week.\n''It looks like business as usual, and that's why we're here,'' Ms. Sheehan said in a brief interview. ''We want business as unusual.''\nTHE 110TH CONGRESS: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK\nCorrection: January 5, 2007, Friday An article yesterday about the scene in Congress as Democrats prepared to assume control for the first time in 12 years, included an erroneous distinction for the late Ann Richards, whose photograph appeared prominently at a tea for Democratic women. She was not the first woman to be Texas governor; that was Miriam Ferguson, elected in 1924.
1816366	With Ad Deal, Insurer Wades Into Bridge Traffic	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E5D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Drivers crossing the George Washington Bridge must contend with 18-wheelers, infuriating delays and noxious exhaust. Soon, they will also have advertisements from Geico.\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is expected to announce an arrangement with Geico, the auto insurance giant, that will include the posting of a huge billboard on top of the toll plaza in Fort Lee, N.J., that says ''Geico Drive Safely.'' Drivers will also see Geico signs with the company's mascot, a gecko, on the tollbooths and electronic signs on the approach roads.\nGeico's message will also be integrated into the Port Authority's direct mailings and its Web site, and costumed gecko mascots will appear at Port Authority bus stations.\nThe arrangement, first reported in The Wall Street Journal, will provide the agency with $3.2 million over two years. It is the first of its kind for the Port Authority, which has been trying to find new sources of revenue to offset rising costs, said Stephen Sigmund, the agency's chief of public and government affairs.\nGeico is not the first company to think about buying a bridge -- or at least the advertising rights to one. And other public agencies have been exploring unconventional ways to bring in more money, even if it means toying with long-held taboos about commercializing public spaces. The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, for instance, is exploring how to sell sponsorships in San Francisco.\nMr. Sigmund said the Port Authority had been looking for the right advertisers since at least 2005, adding that Geico was a natural since it is one of the country's largest and best-known auto insurers.\nIn a world where consumers can fast-forward through television advertisements, subscribe to commercial-free satellite radio and block pop-up ads on the Internet, companies like Geico are continually looking for fresh ways to get in front of consumers.\nIn that context, getting in front of about 57 million eastbound drivers who cross the George Washington Bridge each year could amount to a gold mine, especially because it is not uncommon for cars to spend 15 or more minutes creeping toward the toll plaza in New Jersey.\n''This is more than just eyeballs; it's about reinforcing a message about a bridge that people have an endearing feeling to,'' said Drew Sheinman, chief executive of Axcess Partners Worldwide, a marketing company hired by the Port Authority to develop new advertising.\nMr. Sheinman said that under the agreement, no other signs can compete with Geico's at the bridge, which may allay fears that the toll plaza will become overrun with ads.\n''This is not going to be left field at Yankee Stadium,'' he said.\nStill, the new signs could irritate drivers who view their cars as a refuge from media messages, as well as preservationists who see the bridge, a landmark, as unfit for commercial advertisements -- even if they appear only on the tollbooths.\n''It's a city icon that should not be tampered with in this way,'' said Vanessa Gruen, of the streetscape committee at the Municipal Art Society, which deals with street and sidewalk advertising. ''It's not really worth the amount of money they'll get out of it to block the view of the span.''\nBrand experts also questioned whether Geico, which has won plaudits for its imaginative advertising campaigns, may turn off customers and dilute its name by making it too prominent.\n''Since advertisers have generally lost some degree of control over what messages get into people's lives, consumers resent getting them foisted on them,'' said Robert Passikoff, the president of Brand Keys, a brand consultant.\nBut, Mr. Passikoff added, consumers may warm to the Geico ads as well as others on prominent public buildings and bridges if they know the proceeds are being used to improve service.\nThe Port Authority has set a goal of generating $100 million in advertising and sponsorships, about three times more than it currently brings in, Mr. Sigmund said. He said, though, that the new advertising must match the surroundings and not jeopardize safety.\nLast month, for instance, the Port Authority announced an agreement with Samsung, the electronics giant, to install power outlets at Kennedy International Airport that travelers with laptop computers will be able to use.
1816367	Spitzer's Health Care Pledge Focuses on Easing the Way for Those Entitled	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E5D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Gov. Eliot Spitzer vowed yesterday to make health insurance available to all children and enroll all eligible adults in Medicaid. If carried out fully, his pledges would cut the number of uninsured New Yorkers in half.\nBut those promises may not turn out to be as ambitious as described. How far they go will depend on details the governor and his staff said would not be made public until late this month.\nAt their most far-reaching, the governor's plans would give New York the lowest percentage of uninsured people in the country, and would mark a sharp increase in coverage for the poor. Even so, such promises would not be as hard or as expensive to carry out as most people would guess, according to people who study the politics and economics of health care.\nPeople who have no health insurance tend to be young and healthy, cheaper to care for and cheaper to cover than those who are currently covered. As a result, the United Hospital Fund, a policy research group, has estimated that covering all of the uninsured in New York would cost $4.1 billion a year -- less than one-tenth of what the state already spends on Medicaid, the health plan for the poor. Most of the uninsured are also poor, and already qualify for Medicaid or a similar program, Child Health Plus, so experts said that easier enrollment and more aggressive recruitment in those programs would almost certainly be at the center of Mr. Spitzer's plans.\nThe biggest obstacle, they said, could be new federal requirements that people signing up for Medicaid produce birth certificates or other proof of citizenship.\nIn his first address to the Legislature, Mr. Spitzer said, ''We will introduce a budget that in the very first year, guarantees access to health insurance for all of New York's 500,000 uninsured children.''\nBut to guarantee access to insurance and to guarantee actual coverage could be two very different things. Many people have access to government programs, at least in theory, but do not take advantage of them. Again, the governor did not say precisely what he meant by his promise.\nIn New York, children qualify for free health insurance through either Medicaid or Child Health Plus, in households that earn up to 160 percent of the federal poverty line -- about $21,000 a year for a family of four. Above that limit, up to 250 percent of the poverty line -- about $33,000 for a family of four -- they are eligible for Child Health Plus for a premium of $15 a month or less.\nAbout two-thirds of New York's uninsured children already qualify for one of the programs on those terms. Danielle Holahan, senior health policy analyst at the United Hospital Fund, said, ''That, plus the fact that children are pretty cheap to insure,'' suggests that getting most of them enrolled ''is something we could tackle pretty easily.''\nState law also says that any child, no matter how high the family income, can be enrolled in Child Health Plus by paying a premium that averages less than $200 a month, much less than a commercial insurance policy. Officials in the Pataki administration argued that that means New York already guarantees access to coverage for all children.\nMs. Holahan said the state could draw middle-income children into Child Health Plus by putting the premiums on a sliding scale as incomes rise, rather than having an abrupt jump up from $15 a month.\nMr. Spitzer said that within four years, ''we will enroll the 900,000 Medicaid-eligible adults'' by simplifying the paperwork.\nThat promise could be tougher to keep, experts said, because he is promising not mere access but actual coverage. Each year, about one-third of the people on Medicaid in New York fail to renew their enrollment, though they remain eligible, so policy analysts say that an easier renewal process would keep some people enrolled. They also proposed tying Medicaid enrollment to food stamps, welfare, schools and other public services.\nBut some people are reluctant to sign up, particularly immigrants who mistrust the government or just cannot be bothered.\n''The only way you ever get to really universal coverage is with some sort of individual mandate requiring people to enroll,'' said Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.\nAlmost 14 percent of New Yorkers are uninsured, according to the Census Bureau, below the national average of nearly 16 percent but well above Minnesota, with the lowest rate, less than 9 percent. If Mr. Spitzer succeeds in insuring all children and all people eligible for Medicaid, the number of uninsured in New York would drop below 7 percent.\nMedicaid spends more than $45 billion a year to insure 4.2 million New Yorkers, but most of those costs are spent on older and disabled patients.\nAn estimated 1.2 million people qualify for Medicaid or Child Health Plus but are not enrolled. They are disproportionately healthy young adults and children.\n''Low-income people who have serious health needs end up in a hospital emergency room, and they enroll in Medicaid at that time, if they're not enrolled already,'' Ms. Rowland said. ''So the remaining uninsured tend to be healthier than those who are insured.''\nCHANGEOVER IN ALBANY
1816368	Construction Worker One Day, Subway Hero the Next	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E5D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Wesley Autrey teetered back and forth on the edge of a subway platform yesterday, re-enacting how he dived onto the tracks of a southbound No. 1 train in Manhattan on Tuesday to save another man's life.\nA little boy with black hair and a bowl cut followed each of his moves. Other passers-by at the 137th Street station let loose the occasional hurrah or hand clap. Still others riffled through newspapers, which featured Mr. Autrey's picture and headlines like ''Subway Superman.''\nA few subway stops away, at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center on 114th street near Amsterdam Avenue, Cameron Hollopeter underwent a second day of medical evaluation. Police said Mr. Hollopeter, a first-year film student at the New York Film Academy, had suffered a seizure, which sent him convulsing off the platform and onto the tracks, where Mr. Autrey held him down as the train rumbled just inches above them.\nMoments after the train came to a halt, Mr. Autrey recounted yesterday, Mr. Hollopeter asked if he was dead. ''I said, 'You are very much alive, but if you move you'll kill the both of us.' '' Both men emerged from the episode with little more than bruises, but Mr. Autrey also emerged a star.\nMr. Autrey, a 50-year-old construction worker, said he knew something was different when he showed up for work later on Tuesday. His boss, he said, bought him lunch -- a ham-and-cheese hero -- and later told him to take yesterday off.\nThen yesterday morning, as he walked to his mother's apartment in Harlem, ''a stranger came up and put $10 in my hand,'' he said. ''People in my neighborhood were like, 'Yo, I know this guy.' ''\nOnce at his mother's apartment, he held interviews in the living room with some of the national morning news programs.\nAfter that, it was back to the scene, where he recounted Mr. Hollopeter's backward tumble off the platform and into the path of the oncoming train.\nThroughout the day, Mr. Autrey's sister, Linda, 48, played the role of administrative assistant, logging invitations for the talk-show circuit, including requests from the David Letterman, Charlie Rose and Ellen DeGeneres shows. Phone calls from well-wishers came pouring in, including one from the mayor's office. Mr. Autrey said he had been offered cash, trips and scholarships for his two daughters, Syshe, 4, and Shuqui, 6, who watched as he dived to the trackbed.\n''Donald Trump's got a check waiting on me,'' he said. ''They offered to mail it; I said, 'No, I'd like to meet the Donald, so I can say, Yo, you're fired.' ''\nBy the end of the day, the president of the New York Film Academy, Jerry Sherlock, had personally handed him a $5,000 check.\nYesterday afternoon, Mr. Autrey and Mr. Hollopeter met again. The meeting was closed to reporters, but afterward Mr. Autrey described how he stepped into Mr. Hollopeter's hospital room, where they shared a few laughs as Mr. Hollopeter's father stood by with tears in his eyes.\nShortly after 4 p.m., Mr. Autrey walked out of the hospital with Mr. Hollopeter's father, Larry, and into a throng of more than 30 reporters and camera operators who jammed microphones into their faces.\n''This is Cameron's father,'' Mr. Autrey began. ''He's a very, very, nice, nice man and, you know, I'm not used to this press,'' he said, as reporters shouted at them to lean closer to the microphones and camera shutters popped like party favors.\nMr. Hollopeter was nervous, his hands shaking, as he read from handwritten notes.\n''Mr. Autrey's instinctive and unselfish act ---- '' Mr. Hollopeter said, hesitating, as reporters inched closer. ''There are no words to properly express our gratitude and feelings for his actions. Cameron is recovering and stable. Now he needs his rest, and our wishes are that you respect his privacy. May God's blessings be with Mr. Autrey and his family.''\nThe teary father then slipped back into the hospital, apparently overcome with emotion.\n''Me and the families are trying to make some plans so his family can meet my family and we can have a little gathering,'' Mr. Autrey said, before breaking into a hearty laugh. ''Without the media!''\nMr. Autrey was asked to reflect on the experience.\n''Maybe I was in the right place at the right time, and good things happen for good people,'' Mr. Autrey said.\nThen he hopped into his brother-in-law's tan Toyota Corolla. As the car pulled away, Mr. Autrey had some final words: ''All New Yorkers! If you see somebody in distress, go for it!''
1816369	On S.I., Boom In Construction Is on the Decline	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E5D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The 20-year building boom on Staten Island, long the city's fastest-growing borough, is decelerating drastically, thanks largely to a reining-in of the island's freewheeling zoning laws, officials say. According to city figures released yesterday, permits for new buildings plunged by 43 percent last year.\nSo substantial was the decline that Staten Island almost single-handedly accounted for a 10 percent dip in building permits citywide last year, which was the first drop in the city in a decade.\nIn the other four boroughs, permits fell by 1.6 percent, the figures from the City Buildings Department show.\nOf course, the real estate market has been cooling all over the city and the country, but city officials and real estate professionals attributed the disproportionate chill on Staten Island to zoning and tax changes.\nNew zoning rules passed in 2004, which were aimed at stemming a flood of town house developments that residents complained were disfiguring communities and overloading streets with traffic, require larger lots and yards and more parking. A tax abatement for new one- and two-family homes was also rescinded last year, further discouraging construction.\n''It's one of these perfect-storm situations,'' said Sandy Krueger, chief executive officer of the Staten Island Board of Realtors. ''Everything kind of came together at once: the downzoning, the tax abatement removal and the change in the market. I think everybody is sort of taking a breath here and waiting this out a little bit to see what happens.''\nLast year, 826 permits for new buildings were issued in Staten Island, compared with 1,441 in 2005 and nearly 2,000 in 2003. Permits for new units of housing also declined more than 40 percent through November, compared with a 1 percent drop elsewhere in the city, according to census statistics.\nThe downturn was broadly welcomed in a place where for years development appeared to proceed with pile driver and shoehorn. A one-acre parcel where 18 units of housing could once be built is limited to 7.\n''I don't want Staten Island to stop growing,'' said the borough president, James P. Molinaro, who helped lead the drive for the zoning changes, ''but I want proper growth.''\nThe decline in new housing permits issued on Staten Island affected multifamily dwellings as well as smaller buildings. Permits for one-family homes fell 49 percent.\nCity officials pointed to several developments planned for the island that they said would be more carefully managed, including a 700-unit waterfront complex in Stapleton, north of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which is expected to bring new life to a vacant port.\nAs for the slight citywide drop in new building and housing permits outside of Staten Island, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, Daniel L. Doctoroff, said he saw little cause for concern. New housing construction is slowing dramatically across the country, he said, and total construction spending in New York City is increasing as builders focus on commercial projects.\n''Particularly relative to the overall national housing market,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, ''and taking into account the fact that through much of the year interest rates were rising, I think by every indicator the market here was very resilient.''\nFrank Naso, one of Staten Island's biggest builders and the former president of the Building Industry Association of New York City, a trade group, said that zoning changes had been long overdue.\n''We needed some kind of reform,'' he said. ''We'll continue to build, but instead of building 10 you might build 6. It's not the end of the world.''\nMr. Naso was more upset about the loss of the tax abatement, which cut a homeowner's property taxes for the first eight years after purchase and allowed many first-time buyers into the market.\nJeff Gallo, an opponent of sprawl and a member of the Preservation League of Staten Island, who lives in a turn-of-the-century Victorian house in Stapleton, said he had noticed a slight calming in the air.\n''There's a feeling out in Staten Island now that you just can't get away with everything,'' said Mr. Gallo, a real estate broker who works in Brooklyn.\nEver since the Verrazano-Narrows bridge was completed in 1964, linking Staten Island to the rest of New York City, people have flocked to the island, developers have worked frenetically to accommodate them, and longtime residents have bemoaned the disappearance of open space and the strain on the island's infrastructure. During the 1990s, Staten Island's population grew by 17 percent and civic discontent skyrocketed. Eventually the clamor brought results.\nBefore the zoning change, you were permitted to build a house with a 4-foot backyard,'' Mr. Molinaro said. ''Now you have to have a minimum of 30 feet. You were able to buy a house on Staten Island where your bottom step was the street -- there was no sidewalk. That was legal! You can't do it no more.''\nStaten Island, still by far the least-populous borough in the city, was the fastest-growing county in the state, according to the 2000 census.\nIt is not even the fastest-growing borough in the city anymore, having fallen into a virtual tie with Manhattan. From 2003 to 2005, the population in both boroughs grew by about 0.9 percent, according to census estimates.\nHelen Siegel, 52, a schoolteacher who lives in New Springville, in the center of the island, thought back yesterday to the days when cows and pigs from nearby farms used to stroll across her yard.\n''It might have been better had they done this sooner,'' she said. ''It's all built up on every spare inch of land already.''
1816370	In the Albany of 2007, Many Familiar Faces And a Few New Names	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E5D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Change is in the air at the State Capitol, but the top faces in the Legislature are staying the same. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, were both confirmed on Wednesday as the leaders of their respective chambers -- positions they have held since 1994.\nMr. Bruno was re-elected temporary president of the Senate on a unanimous voice vote despite his disclosure last month that federal authorities were looking into his business activities.\nThe federal investigation did not seem to shake the confidence of the Senate's Republicans.\n''We all know Joe Bruno, he knows you, and he's run this house with some efficiency not formerly seen -- starting on time; ending sessions on time, more or less; and no 4 o'clock in the morning sessions,'' Senator Owen H. Johnson, a Suffolk County Republican, said in sponsoring the resolution to re-elect Mr. Bruno as temporary president.\nNot a single ''nay'' vote was heard, because Senator John J. Bonacic of the Hudson Valley, the only Republican dissenter, had left the chamber before the vote to symbolically register his protest.\n''I think there's a cloud over him, and that cloud is getting thicker every day,'' Mr. Bonacic said of Mr. Bruno in an interview afterward. ''And my concern is more for the conference and the message that the conference sends out -- that it doesn't get diluted or distracted by the problems of our majority leader with the federal investigation.''\nMr. Bruno said after the vote, ''These are challenging times, these are days that are problematic -- more problematic for some than for others.'' He added, ''And I'm here now, and I can tell you, we will overcome whatever challenges are out there.''\nCHANGEOVER IN ALBANY
1816371	Duke Players Once Accused Of Rape Can Return to School	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E4D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Duke University invited two former lacrosse players to return to school yesterday while they fight charges of sexual offense and kidnapping arising from a stripper's complaint after a team party last March.\nCiting changed circumstances, Richard H. Brodhead, the university president, said in a statement, ''We have decided that the right and fair thing to do is to welcome back Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty to resume their studies at Duke for the spring semester.''\nThe invitation came less than two weeks after Michael B. Nifong, the Durham district attorney, dismissed rape charges in the case, saying the woman was not certain there had been penile penetration. Mr. Nifong retained the other charges, which have similar punishment.\nLawyers for Mr. Finnerty and Mr. Seligmann said their clients had not decided whether to return for the new semester, which starts Tuesday.\nThe university also told the two men that they were eligible to rejoin the lacrosse team, whose season opens in late February.\nThe Finnerty family was ''delighted'' and praised Duke, their lawyer said. The Seligmann family said in a statement, ''By now it should be plain to any person who has any objectivity that the charges against Reade are transparently false.''\nThe men, both sophomores, were suspended under a Duke policy regarding suspects of violent crimes. A third defendant graduated the day before he was charged.\nThe case has attracted controversy since the charges were filed against the players.\nLast week, The North Carolina State Bar filed a formal ethics complaint against Mr. Nifong, accusing him of making inflammatory remarks about the team to the news media and misleading the public about evidence.\nThe complaint took issue with public comments by Mr. Nifong, who had granted dozens of news interviews since March, when a stripper first accused the three players of gang-raping her at a late-night team party.
1816372	School Is Shut After Outbreak Of Encephalitis Kills a Pupil	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E4D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	State and federal health officials are investigating an extremely rare outbreak of encephalitis here that killed a second-grader last month and led officials to close his elementary school this week.\nHealth officials said the cases of encephalitis, which is usually brought on by a virus and causes the brain to swell, are unusual because they appear to be caused by a common bacteria, mycoplasma pneumoniae, or walking pneumonia.\n''It's very rare for someone to be hospitalized with mycoplasma, and it's even more rare to see such a severe complication as encephalitis,'' said Cynthia Whitney, acting branch chief for the respiratory diseases branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''What makes this so unusual is that more than one case has been linked to this outbreak of mycoplasma.''\nThe second-grader, Dylan Gleavey of Warwick, died of encephalitis on Dec. 21. A classmate of Dylan's at Greenwood Elementary School became ill with meningitis that progressed to a mild form of encephalitis, said Dr. David R. Gifford, Rhode Island's director of health.\nThe classmate and a West Warwick middle school student who had encephalitis and walking pneumonia were recovering at home, Dr. Gifford said.\nHealth officials also are investigating higher-than-normal absentee rates among students in two Coventry schools who were reported to have had symptoms of walking pneumonia.\nOver the weekend, Warwick officials turned Greenwood Elementary School into a makeshift clinic, swabbing throats and drawing blood from all but 3 of the 275 students, their families, teachers and staff members. Antibiotics were given to everyone who showed up.\nThe school was closed after five students tested positive for walking pneumonia. Mayor Scott Avedisian said officials were keeping it closed for an extra week after Christmas break so the students would be apart for two weeks, well into the incubation time of one to three weeks.\nState officials said it was the first time a school had been closed for such an outbreak, and federal officials said they rarely intervened in cases of walking pneumonia.\n''I've been here for 13 years, and we have not shut down a school due to mycoplasma,'' Ms. Whitney said.\nMayor Avedisian said more than 1,400 rounds of antibiotics were dispensed and nine informational sessions were held for concerned parents. Parents were notified of the illness by computerized phone calls.\nParents were upset, Mr. Avedisian said, but he said he believed they had been given enough information and the chance to ask questions.\nRather than close additional schools, officials were stressing the importance of hand washing and advising people to sneeze into their arms rather than their hands. Lisa Freeman, 41, whose three children attend Greenwood Elementary, said her entire family was taking antibiotics. Her son, Stone, was in the same class as Dylan's brother.\n''It was scary, definitely scary,'' she said. ''But I feel it was handled in a very professional way.''\nMs. Freeman, her husband and children spent New Year's Day getting throat cultures, and came back the next day for blood work. Doctors discovered that Stone had an ear infection, causing neighbors and concerned parents to call and see if he was feeling all right.\n''It's very close-knit here,'' Ms. Freeman said as a gaggle of neighborhood children played in her backyard. ''I think it was the right decision to close school and put us all on antibiotics.''
1816373	IN SHIFT, DIRECTOR FOR INTELLIGENCE IN STATE DEPT. POST	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E4D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	John D. Negroponte, whom President Bush installed less than two years ago as the first director of national intelligence, will soon leave his post to become the State Department's second-ranking official, administration officials said Wednesday.\nMr. Negroponte will fill a critical job that has been vacant for months, and he is expected to play a leading role in shaping policy in Iraq. But his transfer is another blow to an intelligence community that has seen little continuity at the top since the departure of George J. Tenet in 2004 as director of central intelligence.\nMr. Negroponte had been brought to the intelligence job to help restore credibility and effectiveness to agencies whose reputations were badly damaged by failures related to the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and mistaken prewar assessments of Iraq's illicit weapons. He has maintained a low public profile but provides Mr. Bush with a briefing most mornings.\nPresident Bush has hailed the establishment of the intelligence post as an essential step in helping prevent another terrorist attack. On paper, the director of national intelligence outranks the deputy secretary of state, raising questions about why the White House would seek -- and why Mr. Negroponte would agree to -- the shift.\nThe move, expected to be announced this week, comes as the president prepares to announce a new strategy for Iraq as sectarian violence worsens there and approval ratings sag at home.\nThe administration has had great difficulty filling the State Department position. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has asked several people who have turned down the post, according to senior State Department officials.\nBut administration officials interviewed on Wednesday would not say whether Mr. Negroponte was moving because the White House saw him as uniquely qualified for the diplomatic post, or because President Bush was dissatisfied with his performance as intelligence chief, or whether it was a combination of the two.\nMr. Negroponte has served as ambassador to the United Nations and to Iraq, and administration officials say Ms. Rice was trying to recruit him to bring more Iraq expertise to her office.\nAdministration officials from two different agencies said Wednesday that the leading candidate to become the new intelligence chief is J. Michael McConnell, a retired vice admiral who led the National Security Agency from 1992 to 1996. Admiral McConnell was head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Gen. Colin L. Powell during the first Persian Gulf war, in 1991.\nMr. Bush had at first been reluctant to set up the intelligence post, but ultimately bowed to Congressional pressure and made the office a cabinet-level position.\nAs deputy secretary of state, Mr. Negroponte, who would need Senate confirmation for the post, would fill a pivotal foreign policy position that has been vacant since Robert B. Zoellick resigned to take a post at Goldman Sachs.\nThe shift of Mr. Negroponte, first reported Wednesday evening by NBC News, reflects a further transformation in President Bush's foreign policy team that has already seen Robert M. Gates take over as defense secretary from Donald H. Rumsfeld. Mr. Bush still has other top posts to fill, including that of ambassador to the United Nations, left vacant with the departure of John R. Bolton.\nMr. Negroponte would move to the State Department as the administration is preparing a shift in Iraq strategy.\nAs a career diplomat who also served as ambassador to Mexico, the Philippines and Honduras, Mr. Negroponte brought a policy maker's perspective to the role of intelligence chief, a post established by Congress at the end of 2004 to address a lack of coordination among intelligence agencies. He took over the job in April 2005, and said in an interview on C-Span last month that he expected to stay in his position until the end of the Bush administration.\nAdmiral McConnell is a career intelligence officer who is a senior vice president of Booz Allen Hamilton, an international consulting firm. During his tenure at the Pentagon and as director of the National Security Agency, Admiral McConnell worked closely with Mr. Gates during Mr. Gates's time as deputy national security adviser and as director of central intelligence, and with Dick Cheney while he was defense secretary during the first Persian Gulf war.\nSenator Susan M. Collins, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Senate Government Reform Committee, was a major backer of the intelligence post, and on Wednesday she said of the reported transfer: ''The director of national intelligence is an absolutely critical position. I'm disappointed that Negroponte would leave this critical position when it's still in its infancy. There are a number of people who could ably serve as deputy secretary of state, but few who can handle the challenges of chief of intelligence.''\nRepresentative Jane Harman, a California Democrat who also pressed for establishment of the intelligence job, said: ''I'm worrying that our deficit in intelligence will not be corrected. I'm sorry Negroponte isn't completing his term because he at least understood intelligence.''\nMr. Negroponte's move to the State Department has been rumored for months. Ms. Rice was pushing to bring Mr. Negroponte in as her deputy, and officials in Washington speculated that the career diplomat might be more comfortable returning to the State Department.\nThe White House press secretary, Tony Snow, declined to comment on the change. ''We don't comment on personnel matters until the president has announced his intentions,'' Mr. Snow said in an e-mail message Wednesday night.\nOfficials said one priority in replacing Mr. Negroponte had been to select someone who could pass swiftly through the Senate confirmation process. They also cautioned that the choice of Admiral McConnell was not final.\nThe job of deputy director of national intelligence is also vacant, and the White House is conscious that a long nomination battle in the Senate, where Democrats are now in the majority, could throw the intelligence office into disarray.\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ
1816374	Giants See The Angles In a Prism Tinted Blue	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E4D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	At one end of the range of possibilities is a blowout first-round playoff loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. On the opposite end is a Super Bowl victory next month.\nAnd somewhere between may be the point where Giants Coach Tom Coughlin saves his job.\nPerhaps only the team president, John Mara, and the chairman, Steve Tisch, know what it will take for Coughlin to be back for the fourth and final season of his contract. Given that they are declining to discuss the topic, it is reasonable to believe that they are not sure, either.\nThat is why the Giants' game against the Eagles is only a small part of the franchise's larger backdrop. It is a big game, to be sure, but much of the intrigue is not simply from the result on the field, but from what it might do to the Giants' long-term future.\nThe Giants, considering themselves a Super Bowl contender at the season's outset, started 6-2, then lost six of their next seven. They beat the Redskins on Saturday, 34-28, to finish 8-8 and slip into the playoffs.\nIf the Giants beat the Eagles, they will play the Chicago Bears. Maybe it will be enough to ensure Coughlin's return for the 2007 season. Maybe it only takes a solid effort against the Eagles, even in a loss. But if the Giants lose, the focus immediately will turn to the co-owners, the Mara and Tisch families. They must fill the general manager position because Ernie Accorsi is retiring. Now they are being faced with two questions that cannot be viewed independently of that search: Do they give Coughlin another chance? Or do they become the rare team to fire a playoff coach?\nThe analysis is complicated. It would have been easier if the Giants did not make the playoffs. It can become easier if the Giants make a promising playoff run.\nBut the Giants are wallowing in the middle, and it leaves all of them -- owners, coaches and players -- in an awkward spot.\n''Of course, when a team goes 8-8 with high expectations, it doesn't sound good,'' linebacker Antonio Pierce said. ''Truth be told, we're in the playoffs.''\nThat is why the owners are waiting. They have said nothing publicly about Coughlin in weeks. They have not tried to squelch the speculation by saying Coughlin's job is safe, by defining what he must do to secure it, or by suggesting that the entire team will be evaluated.\nMara declined a request Wednesday to discuss Coughlin. Tisch did not return a phone message left at his office in California.\nCoughlin has been left to address his own job security. He has given no indication whether he knows his status. On Sunday, during a conference call, he said that he does not want to talk about it and that he does not think about it.\nThe players also are in an unusual position. Against the Eagles, they could be, in effect, playing for the job of a man many wish was not their coach.\nIt is not lost on some players that the retiring running back Tiki Barber, with his franchise-record 234 rushing yards against the Redskins and a short history of second-guessing Coughlin's coaching, may have helped secure Coughlin's job. That might become part of Barber's legacy -- bequeathing his soon-to-be former teammates another season or more of Coughlin.\nRumors about Coughlin's future are a locker-room topic, players said, but the speculation is fueled mostly by what they see in the news media. Coughlin and his assistants have not suggested during meetings that their jobs are at risk, players said.\nPlayers said they do not believe that the uncertainty surrounding Coughlin has had any effect on the team's performance. Coughlin, with his penchant for militaristic rules and a belief that coaches and players are not meant to be friends, is not popular enough to stir ''win one for the coach'' motivation. But there is no sign that players have given up, either, and the occasional sniping about Coughlin has dissipated.\n''We're all in it together,'' said receiver Plaxico Burress, whose occasional nonchalance has put him at odds with Coughlin. ''I think we all know that we've all got to do our job, and if we don't, nobody's job is secure.''\nIf the result of Sunday's game is not the determining factor for Coughlin's future, Mara and Tisch will have to weed through the factors that created the confusion.\nOn one hand, the Giants had the toughest schedule among the 12 teams that made the playoffs, measured by opponents' winning percentage. Their midseason fade coincided with season-ending injuries to their best defensive player (end Michael Strahan), their primary off-season acquisition (linebacker LaVar Arrington), their sturdy left tackle (Luke Petitgout) and their most reliable receiver (Amani Toomer). They made the playoffs for the second season in a row, the first time that has happened for the Giants since 1989 and 1990. Only a handful of N.F.L. teams have fired coaches after a playoff appearance; the Giants have never done it.\nOn the other hand, they squandered the 6-2 start. They have occasionally displayed a galling lack of discipline and have consistently struggled with injuries -- two traits that Coughlin inherited three years ago and vowed to correct. This season's offense was ranked 14th in total yards; the defense was ranked 25th. And, perhaps most important, the progress of the third-year quarterback Eli Manning has stalled.\nMara and Tisch have the unenviable task of mulling it all and deciding what to do. And maybe it will take one last game -- at least -- for the answer to be clear.\nEXTRA POINTS\nTight end Jeremy Shockey (sprained ankle) did not practice and is questionable for Sunday's game.\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816375	Backhanded Compliments Lobbed by Patriots' Belichick	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E4D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Nick Saban had left the Miami Dolphins only minutes earlier Wednesday morning when Patriots Coach Bill Belichick was asked what he thought of the move. He praised Saban's intelligence. He revealed that he and Saban had spoken by phone Tuesday night. He called him a good friend.\nThen someone asked if having Saban out of the N.F.L. -- and out of the American Football Conference East -- would change the tenor of a friendship that goes back several decades.\n''It will certainly put it on a different footing,'' Belichick said.\nPresumably much better footing than Jets Coach Eric Mangini is on. Belichick and Saban have been close for years, and when Saban was the coach at Louisiana State, Belichick would visit him during the off-season so they could share their knowledge. Those skull sessions ended when Saban became a rival two years ago, but the friendship did not come to a halt. Before each of the two annual meetings between the Dolphins and the Patriots, Belichick could be counted on to speak effusively about Saban -- his coaching, his personal friendship, how well he thought he was doing in Miami.\nIt is a bit different from his treatment of Mangini, the Belichick disciple who left the Patriots after last season to take over the Jets. Belichick has turned a cold shoulder to Mangini this season, barely shaking his hand or making eye contact with him during postgame handshakes.\nIt is easy to imagine that there was nothing more galling to Belichick this season than losing to Mangini and the Jets in Gillette Stadium. With the Jets and the Patriots about to play a first-round playoff game Sunday, the time seemed ripe for a thaw, and Belichick nearly provided it. He spoke of Mangini by name -- something he had rarely, if ever, done in speaking about the Jets this season.\n''Eric and his staff have done a great job down there this year,'' Belichick said, in what amounted to a breakthrough during his news conference Wednesday.\nBut when it seemed détente might be at hand in their latest battle, Belichick subtly pulled back.\n''This is a team that two years ago was a field goal away from the A.F.C. championship game,'' Belichick said. ''Those guys have a lot of playoff experience there. I'm not saying it's the same team from two years ago, but it's pretty close.''\nIn other words, Herman Edwards did a heck of a job with the Jets.\nIt may be a new year, but there does not seem to be much holiday spirit between these teams. For most of the season, Mangini referred to New England as ''the other place.'' But Wednesday, Mangini seemed to go out of his way to gush about all he had learned from Belichick, noting that he is sure to be voted into the Hall of Fame when he retires.\n''One of the qualities I admire so much about him is, as smart as he is, as much success as he's had, his work ethic hasn't changed,'' Mangini said in New York.\nIf this feud seems more farcical than anything else, it may be because nobody is quite sure what is at its root. When Belichick and Bill Parcells feuded, it was because Belichick had left the Jets -- for whom Parcells was general manager at the time -- to join the Patriots.\nCould Belichick be bothered that Mangini left to go to a division rival that Belichick had presumably advised him not to go to, and is now using some of Belichick's techniques to beat the master at his own game? Is Belichick fuming over what the Patriots alleged was tampering with the holdout receiver Deion Branch, who was eventually traded to Seattle for a first-round pick after a contract stalemate, but not before the Jets had offered a second-round pick? Could it be that Mangini, as he was headed out the door in Foxborough, was hoping to take others with him, and Belichick wanted him to keep his hands off the meticulously assembled organization?\nThose are a few of the prevailing theories, but nobody -- or at least nobody who will talk on the record -- can parse the truth from what is rapidly becoming a legendary feud.\nWhen a reporter in New York asked Belichick on a conference call Wednesday why he had been so chilly during the postgame handshakes, Belichick said: ''I made comments about Eric when he was hired. But this game is about two teams this week trying to keep their season alive. It's a very competitive situation, but the focus is on this week and nothing else.''\nLater, he added -- three times -- another thought, ''I never said anything negative.''\nThat is because he has barely said anything at all. Moments after suggesting his friendship with Saban would be in full flower again now that Saban is safely out of the N.F.L., Belichick remained silent when a reporter suggested something that might patch things up with Mangini:\n''Maybe Eric will take another job.''\nEXTRA POINTS\nPatriots safety Rodney Harrison will miss Sunday's game because of an injured right knee. Coach Bill Belichick made the announcement Wednesday but did not say whether Harrison would be available for future games if New England wins. Harrison was injured last Sunday when he was blocked by Tennessee receiver Bobby Wade.\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816378	Resisting the Big Contract And the Quick Fix	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	This being the fourth day of January, it is not too early to talk about baseball -- even in New York, with our two local pro football teams in the playoffs.\nBecause New York is the center of the universe -- it is always about us -- New York fans are convinced they are owed more front-line pitching.\nInstead of going after 44-year-old Roger Clemens for six innings a week, starting in June, the Yankees should take a lesson from Omar Minaya, on the other side of the Triborough Bridge, and seek out relatively obscure pitchers on their way up.\nIn one of the great performances by a general manager, Minaya stocked and restocked his pitching staff with amazing consistency last year. He was able to do it partially because he could evaluate one of the great sources of baseball talent in the world today -- Latinos who may have gotten caught up in psychological quotas or language barriers or cultural divides.\nBut Minaya was hardly locked into signing Hispanic players. He just went out and found talent -- middle-inning, moderate-priced, been-around talent -- and Willie Randolph, the manager, and Rick Peterson, the pitching coach, made the most of it. That's the model -- not Barry Zito for seven years and $126 million, which Minaya and the Wilpon family wisely avoided.\nThe Yankees have traditionally gone the other route, looking for quick fixes with older stars. Look how that worked out, with Randy Johnson winning 17 games in each of two seasons but generally giving the impression that his lanky, rickety body and his testy psyche were breaking down and acting up, respectively.\nNow there is evidence the Yankees are looking to send Johnson back to play for Arizona, a move that would surely make Joe Torre's day, and night. Torre sometimes seemed spooked by having a 6-foot-10 pitcher glide past him in the narrow confines of the clubhouse without even acknowledging him. It wasn't disrespect, necessarily -- just distance, as vast as the Sonora Desert.\n''Randy nodded at me,'' Torre would relate with great relief, once in a while, when asked about Johnson's various ailments.\nIt was galling to Yankee fans to watch the enthusiastic young Tigers defeat their team in a division series last October. The Yankees have been victims of their history of acquiring pitchers on the downward slope -- Johnson, Carl Pavano, Jaret Wright, David Wells redux, and so on.\nNow it appears the Yankees are trying to persuade Roger Clemens to do them a favor and start up those flashes in the stands all over again. Clemens may still need the buzz, but the Yankees don't, even with the Batman-and-Robin friendship Clemens has with Andy Pettitte. But at least Clemens is a good teammate who shares pitching tips and training regimens, unlike Johnson, who just wants to be alone.\nThe prodigal son Pettitte is not the Yankees' answer, either, even if there are older women all over the New York area who consider him their long-lost son or grandson. Andy is modest, decent and courageous, and an icon of the championship days, but he doesn't figure to have much left in his arm.\nNow that George Steinbrenner does not rock the Yankees' world with hourly bombast, the Yankees should build with younger players, the way Gene Michael did while Steinbrenner was temporarily suspended, an exile that led directly to four world championships.\nBrian Cashman, the general manager, seems to have more power and confidence than in the past. He was steadfast after the final hideous loss in Detroit, reassuring waves of reporters that Torre would be back next season, and, by the way, so would Alex Rodriguez. We saw apocalypse; Cashman saw continuity. Now Cashman may have some leeway to reconstruct the Yankees. Young arms are the way to go. Whether Ron Guidry is a good pitching coach, even two-thirds of Mel Stottlemyre, is still not clear.\nThe Mets, at this stage, have their act together, although not necessarily their pitching staff. The fans, who were so upbeat about 2007 after the called third strike to Carlos Beltrán that ended the 2006 season, are now coming to the realization that Pedro Martínez may never be dominant again, that Orlando Hernández may not pitch a full season, and that Tom Glavine will be 41 on opening day.\nSome Mets fans feel deprived because Minaya would not lobby the Wilpons to pay Zito for seven years. The fans should recall the way Minaya went out and found pitchers named Mota and Sánchez and Feliciano, and how, in the desperate final days of the league championship series, the Mets received stunning starts from one John Maine and one Oliver Pérez. They almost won the pennant with two fringe pitchers.\nEven as we speak, Minaya is probably at some estadio in a warmer clime, inspecting a pitcher who has appeared in 20 or 30 major league games for one of the lower-budget teams and needs the right place to reinvigorate his career. This may sound simplistic, but I have faith in Minaya, wherever he may be. There. Now we can get back to football.\nSPORTS OF THE TIMES E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

1816381	Clues on Next Coach? Check the Flight Data	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E3D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	As rumors about Alabama's coaching search reached a fever pitch here in recent weeks, many fans seeking clues about who might fill the Crimson Tide's vacancy looked to the skies.\nNo, not to the stars.\nTo the planes.\nBefore Nick Saban announced Wednesday that he was leaving the Miami Dolphins to take over at Alabama, fans had flocked to FlightAware.com, a Web site that allows users to track flight activity. Was South Carolina Coach Steve Spurrier flying into Tuscaloosa Regional Airport? Was a plane owned by the University of Alabama departing for Norman, Okla., perhaps with university officials on their way to court Sooners Coach Bob Stoops?\n''When you set out a vision for how you can help people, you can envision a whole lot of things,'' said Daniel Baker, the founder and chief executive of FlightAware.com. ''We'd like to claim we had unlimited foresight into how our service would be used, but this certainly is an unusual use for FlightAware.''\nCoaching searches at other prominent college programs have also sent fans scurrying to glean information from online flight data. Internet message boards revealed that fans from Michigan State, Cincinnati and North Carolina State turned to the Web site.\nBaker said he and the other 10 employees of FlightAware.com, a year-old company based in Houston, did not immediately understand the reason for spikes in the site's activity, which he said increased by about 24 percent. They knew, for example, that recent snowstorms in the Denver area generated more traffic, but the reasons for other surges were unknown until the connection was made to coaching searches. Baker said fans were also using the site to coordinate welcome-home parties at airports after a team's victory.\nBaker and his staff could not have anticipated those uses by fans. Neither could Wayne Cameron, manager of the Tuscaloosa airport. He said that after Mike Shula was fired, he fielded dozens of inquiries aboutactivity at the airport.\n''Everybody in the country has been tracking the university's plane and Paul Bryant Jr.'s plane,'' Cameron said. Bryant, the son of the renowned Alabama football coach Bear Bryant, is a member of Alabama's Board of Trustees and the board's athletics committee.\n''They would ask who I'd seen get off planes, or if I'd seen Spurrier, or if I knew where the university plane was going,'' Cameron added. ''It was kind of like a feeding frenzy there for a few days.''\nJohn Howard, a 25-year-old Crimson Tide fan, created the blog hirebobstoops.blogspot.com after he determined that flight activity he traced on FlightAware.com indicated that Alabama may be interested in hiring Stoops from Oklahoma.\n''You have a lot of activity between Norman and Tuscaloosa,'' Howard said in an interview in early December. ''I have no clue if it's all connected, and I'm not saying it is.\n''I just think it's real interesting that all these planes and these cities are connecting.''\nBy this week, however, signals were pointing elsewhere. Flight data turned Alabama fans' attention to Saban when reports emerged that Mal Moore, the athletic director, had flown to Miami.\nDoug Walker, the university's associate athletic director for media relations, said Moore and others involved in the search knew that flights were being tracked.\n''We're aware of it, but it's not affecting the way we're conducting our business,'' Walker said. ''We're not trying to conduct a world war here, we're just trying to hire a football coach.''\nAnd Baker is only trying to operate a flight-tracking service. If fans visit his site, so be it.\n''If it's all in good fun and everyone's happy, it's always a good thing,'' Baker said.\n''But I wouldn't be surprised if people are losing sleep by hitting refresh on the page.''\nNow Alabama's search is over, so at least Crimson Tide fans can rest.\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL
1816382	Saban Goes to Alabama; Miami Fans Turn Crimson	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E3D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Nick Saban had been saying for more than a month that he would not leave the Miami Dolphins. Nearly two weeks ago, he said, ''I'm not going to be the Alabama coach.''\nOn Wednesday, Saban became the Alabama coach. And Dolphins fans were not happy. Chagrined by Saban's departure, two years after he came to South Florida from Louisiana State, many fans flooded the airwaves Wednesday with claims that included deception and carpetbagging.\nSaban flew to Tuscaloosa, Ala., on Wednesday to begin a new life, leaving behind an avalanche of ill will. Kim Bokamper, a linebacker/defensive end who played his entire career with the Dolphins from 1977 to 1985 and has been in South Florida radio and television since, was among those who said he felt betrayed.\n''Wayne Huizenga was in the garbage business for years,'' Bokamper said on WQAM-AM Wednesday morning in reference to the Dolphins' owner. ''Nick Saban may be the biggest piece of trash he's ever collected.''\nBokamper added that he had been inside the Dolphins' complex many times over the years. ''And the morale there right now,'' he said, ''is as low as it's ever been.''\nHuizenga was more forgiving.\n''I am not upset with Nick, because it's more involved than what you think,'' Huizenga said at a news conference. ''I've been through this with Nick for quite some time now, and I feel the pain and so forth and so on, of Nick and Terry, and it's not a very simple thing. No, I think Nick is great. I'm a Nick Saban fan.''\nThat was a hint by Huizenga that family issues affected Saban's decision. There have been reports that Saban and his wife, Terry, did not particularly embrace South Florida. The Miami Herald reported that Saban has a $7 million home on the water in Fort Lauderdale, but that he longed to spend more time in a house on a lake in Georgia.\nThus Saban's two-year experiment as a head coach in the N.F.L. came to a rocky conclusion. He leaves after a 6-10 season, his only losing year in 13 as a head coach.\nSaban, who had a 15-17 record in two seasons with the Dolphins, departs with three years left on his contract at $4.5 million a year. At Alabama, which fired Mike Shula at the end of the regular season and finished 6-7, Saban reportedly agreed to an eight-year deal worth more than $30 million. That would place him among the nation's top-paid college football coaches.\nThere is some feeling that Saban prefers to coach the college game. He told reporters in November, ''There is a great spirit and sense of community when you're in college football, because of people's ties to the school.''\nHuizenga now faces the prospect of having to find the Dolphins' fourth head coach in the past nine years. Don Shula held the job for 26 years. Huizenga would say only that the Dolphins have a process to find a replacement for Saban, and that the Dolphins Enterprises chief executive, Joe Bailey, and the club's chief operating officer, Bryan Wiedmeier, would be in charge of implementing it.\nCandidates could include Ron Rivera, Chicago's defensive coordinator; Mike Sherman, a former Green Bay head coach and current assistant head coach with Houston; Jim Caldwell, the Indianapolis assistant head coach; and Cam Cameron, San Diego's offensive coordinator. Two Dolphins assistants, Dom Capers and Mike Mularkey, have N.F.L. head-coaching experience.\n''In my opinion, the Dolphins have always been about winning,'' Huizenga said. ''I don't care what it takes, what it costs, what's involved. We're going to make this a winning franchise.''\nHuizenga appeared to pull off a major feat when he lured Saban from the college game after Saban had repeatedly declined other N.F.L. overtures. As a college coach for 11 seasons -- at Toledo, Michigan State and Louisiana State -- Saban did not have a losing season. At L.S.U., he was 48-16, which included a share of the national championship in 2003.\nHuizenga, who lives near Saban, called him Wednesday morning and asked if he could come over for a talk rather than meet him at Dolphins headquarters. That was when Saban told him of his decision. Saban then shared the news with his assistant coaches on a speakerphone at the team complex.\n''This is a decision probably he struggled with tremendously,'' Capers said.\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL

For the Pirates, that may be as good as it gets the rest of this season.\nIn front of a small crowd (7,214) at Continental Arena that included an impartial Gov. Jon S. Corzine, Seton Hall defeated interstate rival Rutgers, 77-72, Wednesday night.\nThe game kicked off the Big East portion of the schedule for Seton Hall and Rutgers, which figures to mean problems for both. Neither team fared particularly well in the nonconference portion of their schedules and must now play much tougher opponents.\nBoth have first-year coaches and are in a rebuilding mode. Bobby Gonzalez has come over from Manhattan to try to get Seton Hall (9-4, 1-0) back on track. Fred Hill is the new coach at Rutgers (7-7, 0-1).\nSo far, it is Gonzalez's team that seems to be on the faster track.\n''We don't know how long we are going to stay undefeated in the league, but the bottom line is that we're 9-4 and we won our first Big East game, and it's a rivalry game,'' Gonzalez said. ''Rivalry games are important. We've got to find ways to win games and scratch and claw. That's what we did. That's what we're going to have to do every game. No games this year are going to be easy for us.''\nThe Pirates have a talented freshman, Eugene Harvey, they can build around. A point guard, he had 21 points for Seton Hall on Wednesday. Brian Laing also had 21.\n''Eugene Harvey makes everyone else on the floor better,'' Hill said. ''Everybody gets worried about Eugene's penetration and that opens up the floor for Laing and Jamar Nutter. He's their catalyst and he makes them go. The better Eugene plays and as he continues to develop and grow, they will develop and grow as a team.''\nIt appeared early on that Seton Hall was going to run away with the game. The Pirates had a 34-16 lead with 5 minutes 17 seconds to go in the first half.\nBut the Scarlet Knights went on a 17-0 run to cut the Pirates' lead to 34-33. Rutgers had its first lead, 54-53, on a hook shot by J. R. Inman with 10:11 to go. Seton Hall then started to take control. When Harvey scored on a driving layup with 4:44 to play, the Pirates had a 68-61 lead.\nRutgers was not done. When Hamaday N'Diaye dunked with 1:07 left to go, the Seton Hall lead was down to 68-66. Making 9 of 10 free-throw attempts inside the final minute, Seton Hall was able to close out the game.\nRutgers was led by Inman, who had 18 points and 12 rebounds.\nST.

1816386	The Big East Is Closing In on Perfection in Bowl Games	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	With just a handful of days remaining in the college football season, it is not too early to declare which conference had the best year in 2006.\nWith a regular season that restored the league's reputation, an off-season in which it retained its marquee coaches and a postseason bowl record of 4-0, no conference had a year quite like the Big East.\n''I don't think in our wildest dreams anyone could have imagined us having this kind of season,'' said Mike Tranghese, the Big East commissioner.\nLouisville's 24-13 victory over Wake Forest in the Orange Bowl on Tuesday night put the league in the rare position to have a perfect bowl season. The conference could improve to 5-0 on Saturday, when Cincinnati plays Western Michigan in the International Bowl in Toronto.\nThe Bearcats are favored in the game and have a special edge in that their new coach, Brian Kelly, already has a victory over Western Michigan this season. His team beat Western Michigan, 31-7, in his previous job at Central Michigan.\nThere is a hint of an asterisk to the conference's bowl mark: its teams have been the favorite in every game, caused in some cases by playing lower-profile opponents in lower-tier bowls. Some of those bowl alignments were made after the Big East lost its three marquee teams three years ago and struggled to find top-tier bowl tie-ins.\nBut in Rutgers's victory over Kansas State in the Texas Bowl and South Florida's victory over East Carolina in the Papajohns.com Bowl, the results were never in doubt.\nWest Virginia needed a mountain-sized comeback to topple Georgia Tech in the Gator Bowl, and Louisville took advantage of some timely turnovers to outlast Wake Forest.\nBut the impressive victories by Rutgers (11-2) and South Florida (9-4) will most likely mean that, along with West Virginia (12-1) and Louisville (11-2), four teams from the conference will start next season in the top 25. Only two teams from the league were ranked when this season began.\n''We don't think we could have had a better season this year than we've had,'' said Nick Carparelli Jr., the Big East associate commissioner. ''We feel the best thing about this season is that by no stretch of the imagination have we reached the end of the road. We really feel this is just the beginning for us.''\nPerhaps the biggest victories for the Big East in the past month did not come on the field. Miami made a strong push to lure Rutgers Coach Greg Schiano, and Alabama was on the brink of wooing West Virginia Coach Rich Rodriguez.\nBoth stayed, much as Louisville Coach Bobby Petrino did last year when the Oakland Raiders called and South Florida Coach Jim Leavitt did when Kansas State was among his suitors.\nIn the three years since Miami, Virginia Tech and Boston College jumped to the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big East has managed to transform from a league that no one wanted to be in to a league in which no one wants to leave.\n''I think what that does is send a clear message to recruits that anything you want to accomplish you can do in the Big East,'' Carparelli said. ''Clearly, those coaches who've elected to stay feel that they can win a national championship at their schools and accomplish their goals.''\nThe only coaching loss of the off-season came when Mark Dantonio left Cincinnati for Michigan State. And while that loss hurt, the university made a solid hire in Kelly, and the program is on the rise.\nA key factor in the balance of power within the conference next season will be whether Louisville tailback Michael Bush and quarterback Brian Brohm make themselves eligible for the N.F.L. draft. If both return, the Cardinals could begin the season ranked as high as No. 3 in the polls. If they decide to go to the N.F.L., there is plenty of experience in place at both positions.\nWest Virginia returns its top two players, quarterback Patrick White and tailback Steve Slaton, both of whom will be Heisman favorites. South Florida's freshman quarterback, Matt Grothe, may be the league's best freshman quarterback since Donovan McNabb was at Syracuse.\n''It's not as if Louisville is going to fall off the map,'' Tranghese said. ''Rutgers is only going to get better, and West Virginia is going to get better. We're in a far better place today than we were two years ago.''\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL

But Russell left the Superdome on Wednesday night as a Louisiana State legend and may just leave college football altogether as the N.F.L's next No. 1 pick.\nRussell, a 6-foot-6, 260-pound junior, was alternately bruising and brilliant in leading the No. 4-ranked Tigers to a 41-14 drubbing of the No. 11 Fighting Irish. He ran for one touchdown and threw for two others, one of them a 58-yard dart to Brandon LaFell that finally broke the spirit of Notre Dame in the closing seconds of the third quarter.\nHis statistics were formidable -- Russell was 21 of 34 for 332 yards. But it was his poise in the pocket, his nimble feet and his rocket launcher of an arm that made him dwarf Quinn, who for most the season had been regarded as the best quarterback in college.\n''My main thing was to go out and play a good game against Brady Quinn's defense,'' said Russell, who was named the Sugar Bowl's most outstanding player. ''He wasn't the guy I was playing against.''\nQuinn, a senior, is indeed a fine quarterback and will most likely be a high first-round pick in the N.F.L. draft. As the week progressed here, however, Russell's teammates could not squelch their irritation that the discussion revolved around Quinn rather than Russell.\n''JaMarcus is a good team leader, great guy, has a great work ethic, strong arm and he's a great athlete,'' said Glenn Dorsey, the Tigers' all-American defensive tackle. ''When I step on the field with him, I'm just glad he's on my side.''\nThere was little doubt that Russell was the difference in handing the Irish their ninth straight bowl defeat, much to the delight of the predominately L.S.U. crowd of 77,781. He showed that his remarkable regular season was no fluke: Russell had the nation's third-best passing rating, and he completed 211 of 308 passes for 2,797 yards and 26 touchdowns, with 7 interceptions.\n''Our quarterback was the finest quarterback in the country,'' said L.S.U. Coach Les Miles.\nQuinn, on the other hand, struggled mightily Wednesday. Miles had been polite about the task his defense faced in containing Quinn, but he expressed extreme confidence in his unit.\n''To be honest, I like our matchup there,'' Miles said before the game. ''I like our defense.''\nThe Tigers (11-2) bull-rushed and blitzed Quinn, sacking him once and forcing him to hurry his passes and throw two interceptions. His two touchdown passes were the 94th and 95th of his career at Notre Dame (10-3), but he was just 15 of 35 for 148 yards. For much of the first half, Notre Dame's offensive line, which gave up 30 sacks this season, looked overwhelmed by a swarming Tigers defense that was led Dorsey.\nIn the Irish's last three losses, to Southern California, Michigan and Ohio State in last year's Fiesta Bowl, they trailed at halftime by a combined score of 75-31. Coach Charlie Weis had hoped his team would get off to a strong start, especially against an L.S.U. team that had outscored its 12 opponents this season by 122-20 in the first quarter.\nInstead, the Tigers needed just two plays and 35 seconds to put the Irish into a 7-0 hole after snuffing Notre Dame's fake punt attempt on its first possession. First, Russell found Early Doucet for a 31-yard completion to Notre Dame's 3-yard line, then running back Keiland Williams rammed the ball in the end zone.\nStill, behind Darius Walker's 125 rushing yards, the Irish managed to control the ball for 19 minutes 35 seconds to L.S.U.'s 10:29 and claw their way back to a 14-14 tie with 2:25 left in the first half after Quinn drilled a 10-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Samardzija.\nBut Russell needed just 1:10 to take the Tigers 82 yards, sending a pass 58 yards to Doucet to the Notre Dame 5. Then, on a quarterback draw, Russell ran into the end zone for a 21-14 L.S.U. lead.\n''They took it from us there in the third quarter,'' Quinn said. ''We really didn't convert any third downs. Some of that maybe came from the momentum they got at the end of the first half, but we just didn't play well enough in the second half.\n''I'm proud of my guys, especially these seniors and everything we been through. I think we laid the groundwork for these guys to do great things in the future.''\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL
1816388	Curry Finds Form and Knicks Find a Way to Win	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E1D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Eddy Curry found daylight on a dull gray evening in the Pacific Northwest. It was perhaps the most pleasant sight the Knicks had seen on their extended tour of the N.B.A.'s better conference.\nAfter three straight games of watching Curry get swarmed, harassed and nearly negated by opposing defenses, the Knicks saw him roam freely Wednesday night. After three straight losses, the Knicks saw the clear opportunity for a turnaround.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers were kind enough to leave Curry with single coverage for most of the evening, and Curry did what he does best under such conditions. He attacked the basket with vigor, scoring 27 points and leading the Knicks to a relatively stress-free 99-81 victory at the Rose Garden.\nCurry made 11 of 17 field goals and also collected 10 rebounds for a double-double, checking out of the game with 3 minutes 25 seconds to play. Jamal Crawford scored 25 points and fed Curry, his close friend, with some of his best dunks of the night.\n''I thought he did a better job of understanding where the traps were coming from and when to score and when to pass,'' Knicks Coach Isiah Thomas said. ''He was a load underneath.''\nSo the Knicks (14-21) got their first victory in four games on this road trip, which concludes Friday night in Seattle. They could get Quentin Richardson back for that game, and given the SuperSonics' struggles, the Knicks are set up for a happy end to what began as a dismal week.\n''This is a big win for us,'' Thomas said. ''This whole season, every time it seems like we are at death's door the team responds and gets a win.\n''Who knows maybe this will turn out to be a very lucky season for us.''\nThey arrived here having a three-game losing streak, and with one particularly disturbing set of figures: Their record was identical to what they achieved in their first 34 games under Larry Brown. That is surely not a sign of the ''significant progress'' that James L. Dolan, the Garden chairman, has demanded of Thomas.\nBefore the game, Thomas spoke earnestly of the need for better defense and better foul shooting, and said the Knicks had been too focused on scoring. ''But 95 percent of the players in the league are that way,'' he said.\nThe defense and foul shooting were still iffy Wednesday, but the Knicks did not need them. After the Blazers cut a 12-point lead to 7 in the third quarter, the Knicks blew the game open. Crawford lobbed to Curry for a reverse dunk, and David Lee found Curry for a layup. Stephon Marbury sank back-to-back 3-pointers, and the Knicks closed the period with dunks by Renaldo Balkman and Curry. They led 80-60 going into the fourth quarter.\nThe night opened with a good omen for the Knicks. When Curry hit a free throw in the opening minute, they had their first lead in three games. They converted 58 percent of their shots in the first half. And Curry got rolling against the Blazers' indifferent defense.\nPortland curiously opted for single coverage for most of the half, and Curry pounced on the open space. He had 18 points by halftime, on 8-of-12 shooting, and the Knicks had a 51-42 lead.\nThere were still some blemishes. The Knicks converted just 21 of 34 free throws, and Jared Jeffries remained in a minor funk. He air balled a free throw in the first quarter, and a 3-pointer in the third. Little has gone right for Jeffries on this road trip. He remains a starter but has been losing playing time to the more productive David Lee.\nThough a poor shooter, Jeffries is known to fill a box score with everything else. But he has supplied little lately and is showing the strain. After missing a layup and a tip-in against Sacramento, he slapped his forehead with both hands.\n''Just thinking too much, just pressing, trying to make things happen instead of just letting them happen,'' Jeffries said. ''I'm very honest with myself. If I'm playing good basketball, he'll play me. If I'm not playing good, then he should take me out.''\nThomas said his players understand that their playing time is not guaranteed -- a point he hammered home in November, when he twice benched Marbury in the second half of games.\n''It started at the start of the season, with Marbury's acceptance of being taken in and out of the game or being benched,'' Thomas said. ''Now it makes it easier for you to have a quick hook with everybody else. Had Marbury reacted different to that, we'd be having a problem in January, as opposed to guys understanding that they got to come perform.''\nREBOUNDS\nStephon Marbury has supported the Knicks' effort to make Eddy Curry the No. 1 scoring option. But with Curry recently bottled up by defenses, and the Knicks losing, Marbury sounded like he was losing patience. ''At the end of the day, Eddy's still going to get double-teamed and we're still going to go to him,'' Marbury said after Tuesday's loss to Sacramento. Asked if the Knicks could do something else on the nights Curry is negated -- rather than force-feed him passes in the post -- Marbury said, ''That's how we're playing right now, man.''\nPRO BASKETBALL
1816389	Praise From a Former Rival	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E1D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	A few minutes after Gov. Eliot Spitzer's address, as the crowds left the Capitol's Assembly chamber, a familiar figure walked slowly down the stairs, buffeted by the crush of bodies with nary a press secretary to smooth his passage. It was Thomas R. Suozzi, the bright, passionate Nassau County executive who ran an uphill -- some would say politically suicidal -- primary campaign against Mr. Spitzer, and lost.\nMr. Suozzi, who during the address was seated with some of Mr. Spitzer's new appointees, said the governor had laid out ''a very ambitious and exciting agenda.''\n''It's going to be very tough, but if there's one person who can accomplish it, it's Governor Spitzer,'' said Mr. Suozzi, who last fall attacked Mr. Spitzer for failing to prosecute Medicaid fraud, accused him of throwing ''a temper tantrum'' at one debate, and said that as a prosecutor, Mr. Spitzer did not ''understand what it takes to manage a large, complex, multibillion-dollar government.''\nAsked what he thought of Mr. Spitzer's delivery, he smiled tightly and responded graciously.\n''I would only wish that I could do it as well as he had done it,'' Mr. Suozzi said.\nNICHOLAS CONFESSORE\nCHANGEOVER IN ALBANY
1816390	Chair, Borrowed. Job, Hers.	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E1D61730F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Like Halley's comet or swarms of 17-year locusts, the arrival of a freshman state senator in Albany is so rare that it provokes fascination and uncertainty in equal measure.\n''There was some confusion about my chair,'' said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the only new state senator this year. Ms. Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat, defeated a powerful and popular Republican incumbent, Nicholas A. Spano, in a close-fought election in November.\nBut when she arrived at the Senate chamber for a brief meeting Wednesday morning, Ms. Stewart-Cousins found that there was, literally, no place for her: Her personal chair -- bearing, like every senator's chair, a brass plaque with her name engraved on it -- had not yet arrived.\n''It's supposed to come on Monday,'' she said. Luckily, a colleague, Senator George Onorato, was not there, so she was given his chair.\nAfter Mr. Spitzer's address, Ms. Stewart-Cousins held court near an elevator bank, a stream of well-wishers and future favor-seekers clustered around her. As usual, she wore a scarf draped over one shoulder, a holdover from her early days in the Westchester County Legislature.\n''Ten years ago, when I first became elected, there was another African-African woman who was elected, and people confused us,'' she said. ''I thought I would distinguish myself.'' She wore one on Wednesday, as well, like a muted victory sash.\nMost everyone, she said, had been welcoming. ''Even Senator Bruno was waving at me from across the aisle, even as he was shaking Nick Spano's hand,'' Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. She herself, however, had not had a chance to say hello to Mr. Spano, her former opponent.\nHer office, unlike her chair, was waiting for her when she arrived. ''I have a wonderful office,'' she said. ''It's temporary, though.'' Asked which room it was, she looked around at all the people waiting their turn with her, and lowered her voice as she smiled conspiratorially.\n''I don't want anybody coming in,'' she said. Finally, she relented. ''Eight-oh-eight,'' she whispered.\nNICHOLAS CONFESSORE\nCHANGEOVER IN ALBANY\nCorrection: January 9, 2007, Tuesday A brief report on Thursday about Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a freshman New York State senator, in an article about the opening session of the State Legislature, misstated the number of new senators taking office and referred imprecisely to the historical significance of Ms. Stewart-Cousins' election. Counting Ms. Stewart-Cousins, there are seven new senators; she is not the only one. She is one of a few candidates in recent years to have won by defeating an incumbent; more commonly, newcomers win by running for open seats.

On Monday, he was an honored guest at Mr. Spitzer's inauguration, and on Wednesday, he received a standing ovation during Mr. Spitzer's State of the State message. In an interview afterward, he seemed delighted to see a fellow Democrat control the governor's office after 12 years of Republican rule.\n''Rip van Winkle just got a bad case of insomnia,'' Mr. Carey quipped. He was referring to Mr. Spitzer's inaugural address, which compared the state during the Pataki years to Rip van Winkle, the Washington Irving character who was asleep for 20 years. Mr. Carey, New York's governor from 1975 through 1982, said of Mr. Spitzer's address: ''It's a very big agenda, but it's not too big for New York.

The suit, filed Friday in State Supreme Court, contends that inflation has effectively cut salaries 28 percent since the last raise, in 1999, violating a constitutional bar against reducing judges' compensation. The suit also accuses legislators of linking judicial pay to their own, violating the separation of powers and ignoring the fact that judges work full time with limited outside work, unlike legislators. The lawyer filing the suit, Steven Cohn, said he had been inundated with support from judges. A court spokesman declined to comment but said court officials were pushing hard for raises. Gov. Eliot Spitzer has said he also supports raises for judges. Legislative leaders declined to comment.\nBRUCE LAMBERT

1816401	Defensive Strategies and Fast Food Cravings	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E4DD1130F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	The media poured into town this week for the Bowl Championship Series national title game between Florida and Ohio State. The first day of news conferences Tuesday offered a nice snapshot of some of the storylines emerging this week.\nHere, in no particular order, are 10 that may fill the airwaves and newspapers around the country:\nThe Defensive Pow-Wow\nDuring the off-season, the Ohio State defensive staff took a junket to Gainesville to share ideas with its Florida counterparts. The coaches shared ideology, terminology, watched film and talked philosophy. This is a common practice among college football programs that don't expect to play each other during the season. Ooops.\nThe Tent Boy\nThe star Ohio State receiver Anthony Gonzalez sleeps in a tent that simulates altitude and that has been a key, he believes, to his all-America caliber season. It's similar to the training method used by athletes like Lance Armstrong. Gonzalez has brought the tent with him to Arizona. He's even angling for Colorado Altitude Training, the company that produces the tent, to hook him up with a room of adjusted altitude when he graduates. ''I've given them enough free advertising,'' he said with a smile.\nThe Speed Factor\nAnytime a fast SEC team plays a traditionally plodding team from the Big 10, there are a lot of stories about speed. The biggest difference the Buckeyes will likely see this year is the speed of the Gators' defense, especially the front seven.\nThe Layoff\nWhen the Buckeyes take the field on Monday, it will be 55 days since they defeated Michigan. If they struggle early in the game, the talk will immediately turn to how the team suffered from the lay off. ''Both of us have a huge layoff,'' Gonzalez said. ''So I think it is a complete non-issue.''\nThe In-N-Out Factor\nNothing brought more smiles to reporters' faces on the first full media day than Troy Smith's detailed description of just what makes the local delicacy, the In-N-Out Burger, so tasty. He offered this explanation: ''For the folks back in Ohio, they need to understand first and foremost, it is a fresh burger. The lettuce and tomatoes are extremely fresh. And they toast the buns. That's huge. That's key. They toast the buns. They use a special kind of sauce, too. It is an extremely -- the sandwich is incredible after a long night.''\n(Personally, I find the fries are much better and fresher than conventional fast food fries.)\nThe Underdog Role Reversal\nThere are several similarities between the 2002 Ohio State team that upset Miami in double-overtime in the national championship game and this 2007 Florida team. Like the '02 Buckeyes, the Gators are uninspiring on offense. And like Ohio State Coach Jim Tressel's national championship team four years ago, Florida Coach Urban Meyer's team is a heavy underdog going against a dominant, undefeated team.\nWe'll see if history repeats itself and Florida can pull off a stunner Monday night.\nReggie Nelson's Psyche\nMeyer has maintained all season that his best player is Reggie Nelson, the star safety known for big hits, special teams brilliance and timely plays. Nelson's mother passed away from cancer more than a week ago and Meyer hasn't made him available to the media.\n''Reggie is holding up good,'' said Joe Cohen, one of Nelson's close friends. ''He loves the support, but that's kind of just personal. That's a little too personal. He kind of just wants to keep that to himself.''\nLeak vs. Tebow\nFlorida has treaded the delicate line all season of rotating quarterbacks Tim Tebow and Chris Leak. Tebow is the backup and often comes off the bench in short-yardage situations. The tactic has helped Florida compensate for the team's lack of a competent tailback. It's a credit to Meyer that the system hasn't turned into a chemistry disaster.\nTroy Smith's Height\nExpect the well-gelled Mel Kiper clones to keep bringing up the fact that Troy Smith is only 5-foot-10, which makes his N.F.L. stock questionable despite a stellar senior season that included the Heisman Trophy. This will be a repetitive theme until April's draft. But the Florida defensive coordinator Charlie Strong pointed out that Smith doesn't get many balls tipped at the line of scrimmage.\nThe Team That Can't Kick Straight\nOne of Florida's glaring weaknesses all season has been kicking field goals. The kicker Chris Hetland is 4-of-13 on the season, which is good for less than 31-percent. His long for the season is 33 yards. If the game is close, expect a lot of Fox camera close-ups of Hetland's face in high definition.\nB.C.S. NOTEBOOK
1816402	FROM THE DESK OF DAVID POGUE: How Secure Is Your Wi-Fi Connection?	2007-01-04	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E4DD1130F937A35752C0A9619C8B63	Long-time readers know that I'm not exactly one of the privacy paranoid.\nI've accepted that we all live in thousands of databases. The state of New York knows where and when I drive, thanks to my E-ZPass (electronic toll-booth badge). Stop & Shop knows what I eat, thanks to my grocery discount card. Blockbuster knows what kinds of movies I watch. Verizon knows whom I call, MasterCard knows what I buy--it's just hopeless.\nFrankly, I consider the details of my life so boring to other people that I really couldn't care less. I've got nothing to hide, so why not accept it?\nThat attitude spilled over to a "From the Desk of David Pogue" e-column I wrote in 2004, in which I attempted to throw water on scare-tactic computer-magazine articles that said, in effect: "Ooooh! If you use your Wi-Fi laptop at public Internet hot spots, the bad guys will see everything you're doing and rifle through your files!"\nI'm back again today to throw that water right back into my own face. On this topic, my eyes have been opened.\nIt came about like this: I recently filmed six episodes of a new TV series ("It's All Geek to Me," which airs in February on The Science Channel, Discovery HD and Discovery Europe). In one of them, I wanted to get to the bottom of this Wi-Fi snooping business. I wanted to see exactly what is, and is not, possible for the bad guys to intercept when you're sitting there in Starbucks or the hotel lobby.\nI put a note up on my blog, seeking a guest who could appear on the show and show me the hacky ropes. I found John Baer, a technical consultant who seemed just right for the part.\nWe met (John, the camera crew and I) in a Manhattan Wi-Fi coffee shop. Turns out there was absolutely nothing to it. John sat a few feet away with his PowerBook; I fired up my Fujitsu laptop and began doing some e-mail and Web surfing.\nThat's all it took. He turned his laptop around to reveal all of this:\n* Every copy of every e-mail message I sent *and* received.\n* A list of the Web sites I visited.\n* Even, incredibly, the graphics that had appeared on the Web sites I had visited.\nNone of this took any particular effort, hacker skill or fancy software. Anyone could do it. You could do it.\nAll John needed was a "packet sniffing" program; such software is free and widely available. (He used a Mac program called Eavesdrop.) It sniffs the airwaves and displays whatever data it finds being transmitted in the public hot spot.\nNow, the fact that it's so easy to intercept your Internet signals in a public hot spot doesn't mean that somebody is *doing* it. In fact, of course, most of the time, nobody is.\nNonetheless, John's little demonstration made clear that somebody *could* intercept your transmissions extremely easily.\nSo are you supposed to crawl into a hole, turn off your Wi-Fi, and go back to dial-up?\nNot exactly. You can take steps to protect yourself:\n* If you see the little padlock in the corner of your Web-browser window (or if the Web address begins with "https://" instead of "http://"), you're connected to a secure Web site. Your transmissions are encrypted in both directions, so you have little to fear from casual packet sniffers.

Born August 20, 1917 in New York, the city she loved. Devoted wife of the late Costa and adoring mother of Nicky and Jill. Remembered for her strength, common sense, and elegance. But above all, it was her devotion and un-conditional love for her children and the joy she gave them that set her apart. She will forever be in their hearts.
1816409	Paid Notice: Deaths   FALK, HARRY C.	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E3DB1E3AF936A35752C0A9619C8B63	FALK--Harry C. Everyone at the New York Board of Trade mourns the profound loss of our dear friend and colleague, Harry Falk. Harry's history was filled with achievements, professional and personal: President, CEO, Chairman of the Board (NYBOT & Coffee, Sugar and Cocca Exchange) and leader in the sugar industry with Czarnikow - Rionda, Richco Sugar, and Louis Dreyfus and more important husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend. He was a student of history and often found himself in the middle of some of its defining moments. From the rise of Castro in Cuba to the terrible tragedy of September 11th, Harry responded always as a man of good sense who understood that his role was to do his job with his considerable intelligence, understanding and compassion. He was not the man who proclaimed loudly and made headlines in the midst of all the chaos. He emerged in each instance as a leader who listened intently, spoke honestly, cared deeply about those around him and led them forward with a clear-eyed concern. History sometimes chooses its leaders wisely and it did just that when it chose Harry Falk to lead New York's oldest futures exchange out of the death and destruction of September 11th to a return and renaissance in Lower Manhattan. His practical wisdom was of the rare sort that could see through the turmoil of the current crisis, one eye on the past and one on the future, and act on that knowledge. That ability to look in both directions had after all led him to strongly support the building of the backup facility after the 1993 bombing that allowed the exchange to survive September 11th. He was not afraid of what he saw or what we must do even if it meant we must face wrenching change. He believed that if we all did our jobs to the best of our abilities we would persevere and prosper. Harry loved honesty, curiosity, fairness, decency, kindness and the truth. He hated hypocrisy, greed, injustice, needless suffering, fear and above all the ignorance that produced them. He could not abide the abuse of power and fought passionately against the big and powerful who bullied the little guy. Perhaps that explains his devotion to children. He always loved to say that his main hobby was being with his grandchildren. He knew real joy in the company of children. He understood that the real job of the powerful was to care for those who had little power so he gave much of himself to the Exchange's charitable organization, Futures and Options for Kids. Harry loved children so much, because he knew they alone carried the real keys to the future, a good heart and an open mind, two things that he cherished. God bless you, Harry, as you have blessed us with your wisdom, kindness, integrity, wit and presence all these years. May your family and friends find comfort and consolation in the memories of the remarkable life of a truly good man. The funeral service will take place on Saturday, January 6th, 2007 at 11:30 am at Higgins Funeral Home, 321 South Main St., New City, NY 10956, 845-634-6110. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation or NYBOT Futures and Options for Kids in memory of Harry.

1816434	Paid Notice: Deaths   FREUND, PHILIP	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1D91F3AF936A35752C0A9619C8B63	FREUND--Philip, author and educator, Fordham University Professor Emeritus, died on December 20 at 98, after a short illness. He was born in Vancouver, Canada. He sent prize-winning stories and poems to the Detroit News before he was ten, began college at 16 and almost immediately began to write for the Cornell University literary magazine of which he became editor. While pursuing his long academic career, initially at Cornell, from which he graduated in 1929 and Fordham University where he taught courses in creative writing, film, and entertainment and the arts, he published eight novels, thirteen plays, nine short-story collections, as well as poetry, essays, literary criticism, and other nonfiction. The last thirty years of his long life were devoted to researching and writing a massive history of the theater, ''Stage by Stage,'' published in four volumes the last of which will be available in 2008. The series has been reviewed as one of the most important studies of theater in the 20th century. Amazingly, he was fully productive up to the last few weeks of a life that spanned nearly a century. Philip Freund was a polymath and wide-ranging cosmopolitan but mainly a consummate human being. His many friends will miss his dry wit and his erudite, wise and always gracious counsel.
1816435	Paid Notice: Deaths   FRIEDMAN, JACK	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E1D91F3AF936A35752C0A9619C8B63	FRIEDMAN--Jack, 84, of Hewlett and Boca Raton, died January 4, 2008. For 63 years he was a beloved and loving husband of Jacklyn, a loving and devoted father of David, Dianne and Steven, a most affectionate father-in-law to Rebecca and Michael, and a proud grandfather of seven and great-grandfather of two. An avid tennis player, pianist and music lover, a veteran of WWII, a life long fan of the New York Yankees, he was cheerful and accepting and gave generously of himself to others. He had a wonderful sense of humor and was a true gentlemen in the best sense of the word. He will be sorely missed.

Revolutionizing the merchandise concept in women's footwear was his game and passion. He brought the accessory business to a dominating new high through women's footwear. That was his life, second to his family. We will all miss him greatly.

1816449	The Listings: Jan. 5 - Jan. 11; FRENCH QUARTER FESTIVAL	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E2DF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	France has had more than a casual stake in jazz history. Some of the most influential jazz critics of the 1930s and '40s were French -- notably Hughes Panassie, Charles Delaunay and André Hodeir -- and they established a culture of appreciation that has not abated. (Among the stereotypes recently skewered by Sacha Baron Cohen was the French jazz aficionado; when we first meet his character Jean Girard in ''Talladega Nights,'' he's kicking back to John Coltrane on a jukebox in a country bar.) And over the years France has developed its share of serious musicians. That legacy in particular fuels the French Quarter Festival, an initiative of cultural organizations on both sides of the Atlantic. The festival, also scheduled to run in New Orleans and Washington, gathers a potpourri of French jazz talent; next week's offerings in New York are bountiful. On Monday the pianist Hervé Sellin and the bassist Riccardo del Fra will appear together at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, while the pianist Bojan Z and the guitarist Louis Winsberg will each lead a trio at the Blue Note. On Tuesday the France-Louisiana Friendship Concert will be held at Joe's Pub. On Wednesday and Thursday the violinist Didier Lockwood and the guitarist Sylvain Luc will perform with the drummer Billy Cobham at the Cutting Room. Also on Wednesday a handful of French artists, including the singer Mina Agossi and the percussionist Mino Cinelu, right, will take part in the NYC Winter JazzFest at the Knitting Factory. And at the 34th annual conference of the International Association for Jazz Education, which initiated the festival in collaboration with CulturesFrance, numerous performances will take place, along with some official business: the presentation of an IAJE President Award to the composer Michel Legrand. (The French Quarter Festival runs from Monday through Jan. 21 at various locations. Information: frenchculture.org.)\nNATE CHINEN

Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.\nPreviews and Openings\n'THE FEVER' Previews start on Tuesday. Opens on Jan. 24. Wallace Shawn stars in his own play about a man who wakes up in a war-torn country feeling under the weather (2:00). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.\n'IN THE HEIGHTS' Previews start on Tuesday. Opens on Feb. 8. A new Off Broadway musical about two days in the life of Washington Heights from the vantage point of a corner bodega (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100.\n'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Previews start tomorrow. Opens on Feb. 4. F. Murray Abraham plays Shylock in this Theater for a New Audience production. Darko Tresnjak directs (2:20). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200.\n'THE SCENE' In previews; opens on Thursday. A buzz-maker at the Humana Festival, Theresa Rebeck's new play is about an out-of-work actor who doesn't solve his problems by having an affair. Tony Shalhoub (''Monk'') and Patricia Heaton (''Everybody Loves Raymond'') star (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.\n'A SPANISH PLAY' Previews start on Wednesday. Opens on Feb. 1. Zoe Caldwell leads an extraordinary cast (Linda Emond, Denis O'Hare, Larry Pine, Katherine Borowitz) in Yasmina Reza's new backstage play, in which real life and fiction blur (1:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101.\n'TRANSLATIONS' In previews; opens on Jan. 25. Brian Friel's drama about a British officer in 19th-century rural Ireland deals with themes of language, imperialism and culture clash. Garry Hynes directs (1:55). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200.\nBroadway\n'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley)\n'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)\n'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)\n'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)\n'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\nOff Broadway\n'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)\n*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective (1:40). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983. (Neil Genzlinger)\n'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)\n'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)\n'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)\n'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)\n'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)\n'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)\n'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300.

St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)\n'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)\n* 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\nOff Off Broadway\n'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\nLong-Running Shows\n'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30).

(Brantley)\nLast Chance\n'BECOMING ADELE' Eric Houston's one-woman show about a young Brooklyn waitress's journey to self-actualization imagines a New York where fairy tales are possible even for the very ordinary. The sentiment is heavy and thick, but Kimberly Stern's performance burrows through it to deliver moving moments (1:40). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Ginia Bellafante)\n'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100; closing on Sunday. (Van Gelder)\n'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.\n'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more ''Braveheart'' than ''Passion of the Christ.'' Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott)\n'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)\n'BLACK CHRISTMAS' (R, 100 minutes) It's been more than 30 years since the original ''Black Christmas'' revealed how much fun it could be to unleash a psycho in a sorority house. Glen Morgan's disastrous remake not only sidelines the original's hilariously obscene phone calls but also drags its unseen killer, and his psychoses, into the light. Smothering terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, the movie is no more than a dismal Christmas card to its predecessor. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\n'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)\n'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)\n* 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)\n'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)\n'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott)\n* 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis)\n'COPYING BEETHOVEN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) The director Agnieszka Holland and her star Ed Harris bring intelligence and passion to a fictional account about the creation of the Ninth Symphony. Diane Kruger also stars. (Dargis)\n'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Catsoulis)\n'THE DEAD GIRL' (R, 93 minutes) An impressively well-acted movie, ''The Dead Girl'' has a chip on its shoulder. The relentless emotional violence in it, a compendium of five vignettes related to a young woman whose naked, mutilated corpse is discovered on a barren hillside, is of a level rarely found in movies, even those steeped in gore. There is some gore in ''The Dead Girl,'' but it is eclipsed in intensity by the verbal abuse hurled by its desperately unhappy characters at the people closest to them. (Stephen Holden)\n'DEATH OF A PRESIDENT' (No rating, 93 minutes) This fake-umentary, the subject of much hyperventilation since it was shown at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, imagines what might happen if George W. Bush were assassinated. Condemned as irresponsible wishful thinking by some, hailed as a brave artistic statement by others, the movie, directed by Gabriel Range, is far too banal to merit such strong responses. Its formal cleverness wears thin and after a while exposes a lazy, pretentious form of provocation. (Scott)\n'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)\n'DÉJÀ VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis)\n* 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)\n'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the ''smartest and coolest thief alive,'' and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz)\n'ERAGON' (PG, 99 minutes) This lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Edward Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. Some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. (Catsoulis)\n* '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)\n* 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)\n'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)\n* 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)\n'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)\n'THE GOOD SHEPHERD' (R, 157 minutes) This chilly film written by Eric Roth and directed by Robert De Niro about a spy trapped in the cold of his own heart, seeks to put a tragic human face on the Central Intelligence Agency, namely that of Matt Damon. (Dargis)\n'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh tries to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis)\n'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)\n'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this ferociously engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)\n'I LOVE YOU (VOLIM TE)' (No rating, 83 minutes, in Croatian) In this bleak drama about a young advertising hotshot who learns that he's H.I.V.-positive, the Croatian writer and director Dalibor Matanic conjures a disaffected, post-Communist lifestyle of casual hedonism and emotional bankruptcy. The premise may be trite -- personal growth through unexpected adversity -- but in its pervasive atmosphere of haunting sterility, the movie is as much about the loss of a generation as the redemption of an individual. (Catsoulis)\n* 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)\n'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)\n* 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)\n* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)\n'MAN OF THE YEAR' (PG-13, 115 minutes) Robin Williams plays a comedian and talk show host who plunges into the presidential campaign, telling truths the timid politicians dare not utter. Not really. This would-be satire, written and directed by Barry Levinson, is hectic and tired, with too many plots and too few sharp insights. (Scott)\n* 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)\n'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM' (PG, 108 minutes) In this chaotic, overstuffed family comedy, Ben Stiller is a night watchman at the American Museum of Natural History, where the exhibits come to life at night and attack him and one another. This computerized spectacle spares no expense, but the storytelling is weak, and the hit-or-miss jokes miss more than hit. (Holden)\n'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zoë Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis)\n* 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott)\n'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)\n'PERFUME: THE STORY OF A MURDERER' (R, 147 minutes) There's no other way to say it: Tom Tykwer's excruciatingly literal-minded adaptation of the best-selling novel about an 18th-century serial killer with an acute sense of smell is a real stinker. (Scott)\n'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)\n* 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)\n'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning, Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden)\n'THE TIGER AND THE SNOW' (No rating, 115 minutes, in Arabic, English and Italian) War may be hell, but for Roberto Benigni it's just another romantic comedy waiting to be filmed. This time that gnomic Italian superstar is a poetry professor who must pose as a Red Cross surgeon to rescue his beloved from a Baghdad hospital. But this contrived setup is merely an excuse for Mr. Benigni to climb onto a camel, blunder into a minefield and confront the American military; to Mr. Benigni, war is simply another stage for his outlandish ego. (Catsoulis)\n'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)\n'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)\n* 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)\n'WE ARE MARSHALL' (PG, 128 minutes) This fact-based story of a West Virginia college town recovering from the death of its entire football team in a 1970 plane crash is a stiff, manipulative dud that gets wrong everything ''Friday Night Lights'' got right. Matthew McConaughey hams it up as the college's goofy new coach, who whips the replacement team into decent shape.

In time the sentimentality overtook the guitar-rock, as in the 1991 megahit ''(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,'' but that never hurt anyone's popularity. Here Mr. Adams plays a rare concert in New York. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Ben Sisario)\nBABY DAYLINER (Tonight) Ethan Marunas, the pale, sometimes pompadoured crooner who performs as Baby Dayliner, is a throwback to a few different strains of '80s pop: murmuring about being a ''star without a movie'' over brittle electronic beats, he joins the blue-eyed soul of Joe Jackson, the fragility of Morrissey and the arty synth-disco of New Order and Human League. With the Pierces and Five O'Clock Heroes. At 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10.

(Jon Pareles)\n* BLACK DICE, SIGHTINGS, EXCEPTER (Tomorrow) Noise, noise, glorious New York noise. Black Dice, from Brooklyn, is a big player in the international avant-rock scene, and has remained vital by staying truly experimental: whether playing spacey, hokey psychedelia or alien-invasion squalls of feedback, the band throws itself deeply into its every unpredictable turn. Sightings sticks to guitars and drums for its nightmarish din, and Excepter's songs, with gurgling, irregular electronic blips, evoke the aimless flailings of a damaged robot. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario)\nJAMES COTTON (Thursday) Playing in Muddy Waters's bands in the 1950s, James Cotton helped define modern blues harmonica with his moaning, wrenching phrases and his train-whistle wails. Recent albums with the younger players who studied him prove that he can still rip into a blues. At 8 p.m., B. B.

(Pareles)\nTIM FITE, O'DEATH (Tomorrow) Tim Fite's songs about ''kicking every can in New York City'' are booby-trapped with quick changes from clean country-pop to corrosive punk. O'Death draws from the starkness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the menace of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits, jumbling sacred and profane.

On her own, this Canandian songwriter is as far away from the disco ball as she could be, with dark and rich piano ballads about looking for a cure for the ''lonesome lows.'' For her tour, the Canadian neo-surrealist filmmaker Guy Maddin has put together montages of his work set to her songs. With the Tall Firs.

Or, for that matter, with ''Breaking Free,'' the PG-rated climax from ''High School Musical,'' the Disney Channel phenomenon whose soundtrack was the best-selling album of 2006? Performing the songs from this tween ''Grease,'' to the accompaniment of thousands of squeals, will be the cast of the movie, or at least most of it: Zac Efron, who played the heartthrob, Troy, is replaced here by Drew Seeley, who supplied many of Troy's vocals on the soundtrack.

Alas, the story of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who unified the country through brutality and conquest, is compelling, but Mr. Tan's ponderous score is a huge disappointment. There are gripping moments, especially some propulsive orchestra passages that incorporate Chinese instruments. But the opera's lyrical flights are slow-moving, ponderous and sometimes cloying. Mr. Tan has tried to meld Chinese melody and Italianate lyricism. His music, though, seems caught in some nowhere land between ''Crouching Tiger'' and Puccini's ''Turandot.'' Even the great Plácido Domingo, bravely taking on the challenging title role, cannot save the show. The colorful production is by the Chinese film director Zhang Yimou (''House of Flying Daggers''). Mr. Tan conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out.

(Vivien Schweitzer)\n* 'I PURITANI' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The reason the Met dusted off its stodgy old 1976 production of this Bellini work, and the one compelling reason to see it, is Anna Netrebko. This glamorous, dusky-voiced Russian soprano makes an affecting and vocally lustrous Elvira, the daughter of a stern Puritan father during the English Civil War whose sanity slips away when she thinks her adored Arturo, a Royalist sympathizer, is unfaithful. Ms. Netrebko may not be a bel canto purist's ideal -- her execution of coloratura roulades is sometimes imprecise, and her diction could use more clarity -- but she sings excitingly and stops the show with her Act II mad scene. On the illness-plagued opening night last week, only the fine bass-baritone John Relyea, singing Elvira's kindly uncle despite grappling with remnants of bronchitis, was in the same dramatic class as the star. Patrick Summers conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out.

(Tommasini)\n* EIGHTH BLACKBIRD (Thursday) This inventive and energetic young new-music ensemble from Chicago has built its audience with eclectic programming and commissioning. They have also impressed listeners by playing complex scores by memory, a feat rarely seen in ensemble concerts with much more familiar music. The program includes works by Steve Mackey, Jennifer Higdon, Gordon Fitzell and David M. Gordon. At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org; $10. (Allan Kozinn)\nJUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) The bassoonist Frank Morelli is the guest of this feisty chamber ensemble in a woodwind-dominated program that includes arrangements of arias by Rossini and Mozart, an unfinished wind quintet by Schubert, Gounod's ''Petite Symphonie'' and an Andante by Reicha. At 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-1259, jupitersymphony.com; $10 to $25. (Kozinn)\n* 'MOSTLY OPERETTA' (Wednesday and Thursday) To celebrate a neglected genre that once held Europe in thrall and spawned the Broadway musical, the Austrian Cultural Forum is starting a two-week festival on Wednesday with a program of Emmerich Kalman, Oscar Straus and Franz Lehar, accompanied by visuals by the Austrian artist Victoria Coeln. Kalman and Lehar both wrote for Marta Eggerth, a major stage and screen star from the 1930s who has retained a solid vocal technique into her ninth decade, and gave several sold-out cabaret evenings at Café Sabarsky last year to prove it. On Thursday she will talk about operetta style and demonstrate it with some singing of her own; it's worth hearing. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org; free, but reservations are required. (Midgette)\nMY LORD CHAMBERLAIN'S CONSORT (Sunday) This early-music group was formed in 1997 to present a complete performance of John Dowland's ''First Book of Songs or Ayres.'' Here they will perform four centuries of English carols arranged for lutes, harps, voices and viol. At 3 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 288-8920, mapc.com; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer)\nNEW YORK GILBERT AND SULLIVAN PLAYERS (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) ''The Yeoman of the Guard'' is perhaps Gilbert and Sullivan's most operatic work; ''Mikado,'' their most beloved; and ''The Rose of Persia,'' not really a Gilbert and Sullivan work at all, since the book (based on the ''Arabian Nights'') was written by Basil Hood some years after a quarrel ended Gilbert and Sullivan's collaboration. These three works constitute the 33rd season of New York's best-established G&S troupe, led by the indomitable Albert Bergeret. ''Yeoman,'' tonight at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 3; ''Mikado,'' tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., and Tuesday at 7 p.m.; ''Rose,'' Thursday at 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $40 to $96, 10 percent off $40 to $80 tickets for 65+. (Midgette)\nNEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow and Tuesday) Old favorites are making return visits, and this means the pieces and the performers. Zubin Mehta conducts, and Pinchas Zukerman is the soloist in the Beethoven Violin Concerto and Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $33 to $101. (Holland)\n'ONE DOLLAR CONCERT AT CARNEGIE HALL' (Tomorrow) The pianist João Carlos Martins, a Brazilian who has made some provocative but powerful Bach recordings, has moved to the podium and is introducing himself to New York as a conductor in a bargain-priced concert meant also to call attention to the Amazon Region Protected Areas program and its efforts to preserve the Amazon rain forest. Mr. Martins will lead his 27-player Bachiana Chamber Orchestra in Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 1, Villa-Lobos's ''Preludio Bachiana'' and the premiere of ''Amazona'' by Stefan Meylaers. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $1. (Kozinn)\n* SEQUITUR (Monday) This first-rate new-music band turns its attention to contemporary Cuban works, with a program that includes scores by Tania León, Sergio Barroso, Keyla Orozco, Orlando Jacinto García and Jorge Martín. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, sequitur.org; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)\nVOLKER VOGEL (Tuesday) The music of the Austrian composer and writer Ernst Krenek ranges from neo-romanticism to serialism. He wrote his tonal ''Reisebuch aus den Österreichischen Alpen,'' a cycle of 20 songs about the Austrian countryside, in 1929, after studying Schubert. Mr. Vogel, a tenor, sings the work as part of the Sound of Song series at the Austrian Cultural Forum, accompanied by the pianist Ann Beckman. At 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org; free, but reservations are required.

If you want to see how real men pirouette, check out the Trocks, as they are called, performing classics like ''Swan Lake'' and creepy 20th-century ballets like ''The Cage.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44.

(Dunning)\nCLARE BYRNE DANCE (Thursday) Ms. Byrne, a nicely quirky longtime presence in New York modern dance, describes her ''Rounds, the First Last Dance, or the Last First Dance, or an Ordination'' as calling up ''the doing-ness of dance. Uh-oh. (Through Jan. 14.) At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com; $20. (Dunning)\nComplexions Contemporary Ballet (Tuesday through Thursday) This company, founded in 1994 by Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, is notable for its wonderful dancers and, often, less-than-wonderful choreography. But this season looks promising, with a work by Mr. Richardson to the music of Marvin Gaye; new pieces by Nicolo Fonte and Jodie Gates; and a solo for Mr. Richardson -- one of dance's true stars -- by Taye Diggs. Yes, that Taye Diggs. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $42; $32 for Joyce members. (Roslyn Sulcas)\n* DANCE ON CAMERA FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday and Wednesday) Presented by the Dance Film Association and the Film Society of Lincoln Center, this festival ranges more widely than ever, with nine programs of dance created for the camera, documentaries and archival compilations. Today at 1, 3:30, 6:15 and 8:30 p.m.; tomorrow at 1, 3:30, 6 and 8:30 p.m.; Sunday at 1, 4 and 7 p.m. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; $10; $5 for 65+ and children 6 through 12.

(Sulcas)\n* NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The company director, Peter Martins, has combined the sleekness of 21st-century ballet dancing with elements of the 19th-century classic in this staging of ''The Sleeping Beauty.'' This production also offers a chance to savor familiar favorites and unfamiliars in new roles. Tonight there will be debuts in the leading roles: Prince Désiré (Sébastien Marcovici), Aurora (Yvonne Borree), the Lilac Fairy (Sara Mearns) and the evil Carabosse (a vivid Melissa Barak). The cast will return on Sunday afternoon. The ballet's lead roles will also be danced by Wendy Whelan, Jennie Somogyi, Jenifer Ringer, Philip Neal, Teresa Reichlen and others. Tonight and Thursday night at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $20 to $95.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.\nMuseums\n* American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith)\nCooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)\n* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n* THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n* THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)\n* MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)\n* Museum of Arts & Design: 'Simply DROOG: 10 + 3 YEARS OF CREATING DISCUSSION AND INNOVATION,' through Jan. 14. Droog Design, a many-headed, loosely affiliated collective of usually, but not entirely, Dutch designers and architects has probably generated more discussion than innovation in its 13 years of existence. Presented in a free-flowing, Droog-designed layout, this show vigorously continues the process. It includes about 150 mostly domestic objects by scores of designers. Some are great, some are silly, some are Conceptual Art. But there is plenty to sink your teeth into, especially with help from the small free brochure containing label information and rationales for each item. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org. (Smith)\n* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)\nOnassis Cultural Center: 'Athens-Sparta,' through May 12. Painted vases, pottery, sculptured steles, tiny carved figures, writings inscribed on stone and a selection of coins are among the nearly 300 objects in this show, whose first section begins with objects from both cities during the Geometric Period (1050-700 B.C.) Two other sections deal with the on-again, off-again relationship between the cities in the fifth century B.C. As society evolved from tribal to civil and felt the first stirrings of democracy during the Archaic Period (650-480 B.C.), rigid geometrical motifs were succeeded by more human forms, like the kouroi and korai, the stone or bronze statues, sometimes life-size, representing young men and women and symbolizing a new emphasis on the individual. On view from the sixth century B.C. are two small Attic representations of kourai, dressed statues of maidens, said to represent the Athenian aristocracy in rites celebrating the goddess Athena. Carved in stone, with long, braided hair (one is headless, but her braids are visible) and beautifully articulated drapery that clings to their bodies, they disappeared as a type after the Persian wars. 645 Fifth Avenue, near 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck)\n* P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER,' through Jan. 15. With 46 artists and a mix of usual and unusual suspects, this exhibition forms a black hole in which Dada, Fluxus, Punk, Pop, Conceptual and Neo-Conceptual mingle like cackling furies along with Performance art, feminism, abject art and various forms of appropriation. While its dour tone becomes a bit relentless, it is admirably consistent and shows artists grappling with reality, which has its own kind of comfort. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)\nP.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'THE GOLD STANDARD,' through Jan 15. Gold is both color and subject in this glittering, pertinent show, installed on creamy yellow walls. Even though a generally dim view of contemporary society prevails, it is scary how good gold makes everything look. (See above.) (Smith)\nWhitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Holland Cotter)\nLast Chance\nAmerican Folk Art Museum: 'A Deaf Artist in Early America: The Worlds of John Brewster Jr.,' Few Early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Mr. Brewster was born deaf in an era before remedial help or a common sign language existed. The case the show makes that Mr. Brewster's disability is reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)\nBrooklyn Museum: 'Looking Back from Ground Zero: Images from the Brooklyn Museum Collection' This show presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, ''Building the World Trade Center,'' produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. ( Cotter)\n* Frick Collection: 'Domenico Tiepolo (1727-1804): A New Testament' The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattista, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)\nInternational Center of Photography: 'Ecotopia: The Second I.C.P. Triennial of Photography and Video' Punctuated by big, black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of Al Gore's ''Inconvenient Truth.'' The work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered. Along the way, some of the current uses for, and technical developments in, photography and video are surveyed, adding to the impression that the I.C.P.'s focus on camera-related media, coupled with its curators' determination to be purposefully topical, sidesteps many of the pitfalls of the biennial-triennial genre. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)\nMORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION' AND 'MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION' Memorializing Mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots, among them François Boucher, Hubert Robert and Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Jacques-Louis David; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan's collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display -- letters and musical scores, like the autograph manuscript of the ''Haffner'' Symphony performed at Mozart's first public concert in Vienna in 1783 -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)\n* New-York Historical Society: 'Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery' Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the '60s, a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 2 West 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)\n* A. L. STEINER: 1 MILLION PHOTOS, 1 EURO EACH (MINIMUM ORDER) and UNBORROWED FROM THE EYE: LUKE DOWD, SCOTT MYLES, DAVID NOONAN, BRETT CODY ROGERS AND GILES ROUND Contrasts happen. In the outer gallery five young men explore what might be called Neo-Constructivist quasi-painting with a kind of desperate, post-punk glower. In the inner gallery A. L. Steiner's raunchy, out-there photographs show almost nothing but women having a blast being women. They avoid the all-too-usual connotations of exploitation and sensationalism that plague intimate, often sexual photographs, which is no mean achievement, politically or aesthetically. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9563, johnconnellypresents.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n* CHEYNEY THOMPSON: 'QUELQUES ASPECTS DE L'ART BOURGEOIS: LA NON-INTERVENTION' A teasing, tantalizing, subtly beautiful show by one of the sharper young artists of the moment explores the tensions between street and studio, skill and skepticism, painting and nonpainting and culture and commerce with seemingly abstract canvases, photographs framed by folding street-vendor tables and tinted off-set lithographs of the gallery's storage shelves. The title translates as ''Certain Aspects of Bourgeois Art: Non-Intervention.'' Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8849; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n* ATELIER VAN LIESHOUT: SLAVECITY In this only partly satirical show, architectural scale models, drawings, sculpture, a map and an extensive business plan propose a highly efficient, completely self-sufficient city whose ''participants'' each have a desk job, a farm job and very little time off. The tyranny of it all is brought home in the second gallery, which contains the ''Midi Disciplinator,'' a cell built to accommodate 18 people working in shifts, filing logs into sawdust for no good reason. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n* 'When the Revolution Comes' The artist Michael St. John has brought some interesting people together in this scrappy, savory group show. It's great to revisit Nancy Grossman's leather-bound heads, looking as radical as they did 30 years ago, and Holt Quentel's distressed gray banners from the 1980s, out of view since but looking right, right now. Strong young artists like Nate Lowman, Joshua Weintraub and Josh White sustain growing reputations, and a bevy of less familiar figures look good. Also in the gallery: a small solo of vivacious, minutely detailed drawings by Josedgardo Granados that bring pre-Columbian and post-Columbian worlds together in a cultural and psychic revolution still in progress. Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts, 508 West 26th Street, Suite 5A, Chelsea, (212) 463-8500, kathleencullenfinearts.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n* The Whitney Museum of American Art: Mark Grotjahn Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shieldlike frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)\nCorrection: January 12, 2007, Friday A dance entry in the Listings pages of Weekend last Friday about Complexions Contemporary Ballet, which is at the Joyce Theater this week, misstated the date its engagement ends. It is Sunday; it did not end yesterday.\nThe entry also misidentified the choreographer whose work is set to the music of Marvin Gaye. He is Dwight Rhoden -- not Desmond Richardson, who is a choreographer and dancer who runs the company with Mr. Rhoden. And the entry included an outdated reference to a new work by Nicolo Fonte. The program was changed and does not include that work.

The network of grass-roots promotion and word-of-mouth Web sites that, irritatingly, has come to be called Web 2.0 -- YouTube, MySpace, etc. -- has been a significant force in music over the last year or two. And if the success of Cold War Kids is any indication, it remains a vital and effective tool for a band to build a big audience quickly, and is nowhere near the Malthusian implosion that cynics foretell. The band, above, from Long Beach, Calif., was founded in 2004, and last year found itself on the top of the music-blogger food chain, with a repertory of craggy guitars, verge-of-a-nervous-breakdown vocals and elliptical songwriting. Par for the indie-rock course, maybe, but on its debut album, ''Robbers & Cowards'' (Downtown), Cold War Kids sketch unusually intense portraits of doubt and faith. ''Hospital Beds'' features two terminally ill men keeping each other company, and in ''Passing the Hat'' the thief of a church collection basket offers his defense: ''The givers not knowing where their money's going is as sinful as throwing away.'' This month the band is playing a ''bicoastal residency'': weekly gigs at three New York clubs, beginning on Wednesday at Pianos, and on Fridays in Los Angeles. (The schedule is -- where else? -- on its MySpace page, myspace.com/coldwarkids). After completing this series, the group heads out on tour with Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, the Web musical phenomenon from way back in 2005. (Wednesday at 9 p.m., with the Virgins, at Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, 212-505-3733, pianosnyc.com; sold out.)\nBEN SISARIO
1816452	The Listings: Jan. 5 - Jan. 11; FRESH TRACKS	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E1DF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Another year, another edition of Fresh Tracks. If you're still looking for the perfect way to mark the new year, you could do worse than this, Dance Theater Workshop's longstanding showcase for new dance. Created in 1965, Fresh Tracks is the workshop's longest-running series for new choreography, and it is highly competitive. Its choreographers have ranged from Bill T. Jones to Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker. The latest roster, chosen through open auditions, is all female: Ursula Eagly, Lala Ghahreman, Heather McArdle, Tara O'Con, Deganit Shemy and Ani Weinstein. Fresh Tracks is not just an opportunity for choreographers to gain exposure; the program last year also began offering each artist a residency, including 50 hours of rehearsal space and training sessions in grant writing, fund-raising and marketing. Service changes aside, Fresh Tracks remains the usual grab bag of short works. Ms. Shemy will present ''Queen-tet,'' a tricky ensemble for five women, performed in Israel in 2005. Ms. McArdle, above, who some dancegoers may remember from David Dorfman's ''Underground'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, will present work by her own company, BluePrintViolation. Ms. Weinstein will close each evening with her solo ''Show Me the Body,'' inspired by both the legal proceedings surrounding detainees at Guantánamo Bay and by Paul Auster's ''Invention of Solitude.'' (Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $12 and $20.)\nCLAUDIA LA ROCCO
1816453	The Listings: Jan. 5 - Jan. 11; SERGIO PREGO	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E1DF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	To take the fullest pleasure in the exhibition of sculptures and video by the Spanish artist Sergio Prego at Lehmann Maupin Gallery, you must stand perfectly still and quiet in front of ''Black Monday'' (2006), a single-channel video of still life photographs of controlled fireworks explosions taken inside an abandoned factory in Bilbao, Spain (above). In all, the artist took more than a thousand photographs of 17 different explosions with 40 cameras. He then scanned them into a computer, cropped them and ran them together. He also composed what he calls ''a sequencing of sounds,'' a series of repeating ambient electronic noises that serve as the soundtrack. The results are a multifaceted representation of something that is usually invisible to the eye: explosion clouds immobilized in time and space, forming immensely beautiful sculptural shapes. It brings out the inner pyro in all of us. Sometimes these clouds even resemble dancing figures. It is as if you were looking at a three-dimensional sculpture in video, though a few frames later, the form magically evaporates. The video lasts only three and a half minutes, which gives you just enough time to get hooked before it starts all over again. It is like stepping into another dimension. (Sergio Prego, Lehmann Maupin Gallery, 540 West 26th Street, Chelsea, 212-255-2923, lehmannmaupin.com, through Feb. 10.)\nBENJAMIN GENOCCHIO
1816454	SPARE TIMES: Jan. 5 - Jan. 11; HENRY AND MUDGE	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E1DF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Theatreworks/ USA's latest production is full of luxurious romps in the grass, tender caresses and big, wet kisses. But none of it is inappropriate for children. The hunka hunka burnin' love behind these displays is Mudge, the canine half of the boy-and-his-dog duo Cynthia Rylant made famous in her ''Henry and Mudge'' books.\nAnd what a large hunk he is: 182 pounds. He and Henry are now frolicking onstage, above, in Theatreworks's hourlong musical adaptation, which focuses on Mudge's boisterous entry into Henry's life. Henry and his parents have just relocated from an unnamed city to farm country (although you may wonder just how rural this spot is; the family still buys Chinese takeout). The move feels like foreign exile to Henry, who misses his best friend, his cousin Annie. So his parents (Joan Hess and Patrick Boll) offer him man's best friend.\nJoseph Morales, a young adult actor, makes a winning Henry, and Todd Buonopane -- this is no insult -- is quite a dog as Mudge. Mr. Buonopane, who began his Broadway career as an understudy in ''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,'' faces far greater challenges here than polysyllabic words; as a dumb animal (Henry's mother feels this applies in every sense of the phrase), Mudge is ignorant of the entire language. Kait Kerrigan, who wrote the show's book and the lyrics for Brian Lowdermilk's ebullient score, provides very funny monologues of Mudge's thoughts and offers a wry take on a dog's perspective: when first given commands, Mudge just grins, offers a hand (or paw) and cluelessly says, ''Hi.'' (This will be immediately recognizable to anyone who has been around Labrador retrievers.) And Mr. Buonopane is very convincing. Jennifer Cody is also delightfully feisty as Annie, who threatens to steal Mudge's heart when she pays a visit.\nEven children who don't have dogs will recognize the jealousy this encounter engenders and will be relieved to see that friendship prevails all around. Directed by Peter Flynn, this is one story in which ''I feel complete again when I smell you'' is the purest expression of love. (Today and tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 4 p.m., the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, 212-279-4200; $25. Through Jan. 20.)\nLAUREL GRAEBER
1816455	SPARE TIMES: Jan. 5 - Jan. 11; FLOODWALL	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE1DF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	When Jana K. Napoli, an artist born and bred in New Orleans, returned to her hometown a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit, she sifted through the detritus in her neighborhood. She found sofas and pianos and hand-sewn lace, but she picked up only the abandoned dresser drawers. Originally she envisioned them as receptacles for a new project. But the more drawers she salvaged, the more she saw promise in them alone. ''I began to realize that these drawers could be a symbol of the households that were lost,'' Ms. Napoli said. She collected 700 drawers from across the city, meticulously labeling each with the address where it was found. They became the basis for ''Floodwall,'' above, an installation now on view on the Liberty Street Bridge, near the World Financial Center. Balanced along the span of the bridge like luggage left behind, the drawers are revealingly empty: once home to family secrets and worldly goods, they now contain only layers of liner paper and imprints from letters and photographs. But they are not anonymous. Working with neighborhood associations, Ms. Napoli found some of their owners. With a partner, she began an ambitious oral history and database, cataloging the lives of New Orleans residents through this most steadfast of possessions. ''My father surprised me with that cedar chest for my trousseau,'' one woman recalled; another kept her son's belongings in a drawer, decades after he was murdered. In ''Floodwall,'' comments like these are broadcast on LED signs as reminders of the lives these wooden survivors touched. (On the Liberty Street Bridge; enter at One World Financial Center on Liberty Street and South End Avenue, Lower Manhattan. Through Feb. 9. For more information or to be a part of the oral history project: floodwall.org.)\nMELENA RYZIK

They published more than 150 scholarly articles and several exhibition catalogs before they both died in 1993.\nAnd then there is the relatively quick and intense collecting model, which Mark and Susan Laracy, a Connecticut couple, followed as they formed a collection in 25 years. They are selling 225 pieces of American antique furniture and folk art at Sotheby's on Jan. 20.\nAfter buying their first antique in 1982 from the veteran Stonington, Conn., dealer Marguerite Riordan at the Winter Antiques Show, the Laracys plunged into the Americana world with unfettered enthusiasm. Every year they attended the Americana auctions in Portsmouth, N.H., visited the Skinner sales in Boston and scoured the antiques fairs and auction houses in New York.\nNow they are selling everything in a single-owner sale that is expected to bring $3 million to $6 million. It includes folk art portraits by John Brewster Jr., Sheldon Peck, Sturtevant J. Hamblen and Ammi Phillips, as well as New England highboys, chairs, chests and desks. One standout is a Queen Anne mahogany desk and bookcase with original finials, brass hardware and pad feet that was made in the Connecticut River Valley in the late 1700s.\nWhy was Americana so appealing to the Laracys? ''When you are 40, you want to convey an image of stability and having had ancestors, even if you come from nowhere,'' Mr. Laracy said. ''Americana provides that.'' A former perfume executive, Mr. Laracy established his company, Parfums de Coeur, when he was 40; sales of its inexpensive versions of popular designer fragrances are now $100 million a year.\nAfter that first purchase at the Winter Antiques Show, the Laracys began collecting Americana seriously under the guidance of Mrs. Riordan. ''She controlled our brains for 10 years,'' Mr. Laracy said. ''If we were attracted to a piece for aesthetic reasons, she made sure there were no condition issues, that the piece was unique and retained its original color.''\nSeveral important works came through Mrs. Riordan, from small sculptures to needlepoint samplers to major Queen Anne Connecticut case pieces: a cherry bonnet-top high chest, a small cherry dressing table, a cherry blanket chest and a maple tavern table.\nEqually important are four portraits by Brewster, the itinerant deaf painter. Mrs. Riordan negotiated the acquisition of a pair of large Brewster portraits depicting Maj. Daniel Coffin and his wife, Elizabeth Stone Coffin, of Newburyport, Mass. She persuaded Eddy G. Nicholson, a New Hampshire investor and part owner of the Congoleum Corporation, to sell them to the Laracys.\n''We never did meet Eddy Nicholson, but I can tell you it took two years to agree on a price with him,'' Mr. Laracy said. Sotheby's estimate for the pair is $150,000 to $300,000.\nMrs. Riordan also sold the Laracys a smaller-scale pair of Brewster portraits, of a brother and sister. They show a sensitivity to children and are similar in feeling to the children's portraits in the current Brewster show at the American Folk Art Museum, which closes on Sunday.\nThe sale is also noteworthy for its wealth of little objects: a whalebone knitting basket, a carved slate plaque with a couple dressed in Indian attire, an engraved and scrimshawed whale ivory watch stand and a Windsor cradle.\n''I love smalls,'' Mr. Laracy said. ''They have a tactile quality.''\nElisabeth Donaghy Garrett, an Americana expert, author and educator, noted another characteristic of the collection: charm.\n''It is an exceptional collection in terms of provenance, outstanding form, condition, outline and color,'' she said, ''but the theme that popped out at me is love, or affection, which comes through pictorially. There are pieces with hearts and courting couples on textiles and plaques. There's a playfulness that carries through.''\nOne hooked rug shows 34 children jumping rope, skating, fishing and dancing around a maypole, with a banner reading ''Children will play, four seasons round.''\nCollectors of Americana typically focus on either furniture or folk art, but the Laracys collected both. The sale includes a group of 19 blue-decorated salt-glazed stoneware vessels, a weather vane, whimsical andirons and a bird cage in addition to all the antique furniture.\n''Our approach was to focus on the finest examples we could find across a number of categories,'' Mr. Laracy said.\nProvenance seems to have been particularly important to the Laracys, who organized the lots in the catalog by provenance.\nApart from Eddy Nicholson's portraits, there are several pieces formerly owned by the Littles, including a magnificent Hamblen folk art portrait of a girl in a white dress that is estimated at $100,000 to $300,000. Other pieces were once owned by such serious collectors as Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Paul and Margaret Weld, Virginia Ramsey-Pope Cave, Burton and Helaine Fendelman and John Howland Ricketson III.\nThe Laracys are selling their Georgian colonial house in New Canaan, Conn., and moving into Manhattan. They now plan to collect contemporary art and 20th-century modern furniture: ''a mix of American, Italian and French,'' Mr. Laracy said.\n''We are changing our lives,'' he added.\nThe presale viewing begins next weekend, on Jan. 13. On the morning of Jan. 18 Sotheby's Institute of Art is to hold a private tour of the collection and a symposium with Ms. Garrett; Paul S. D'Ambrosio, director of the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y.; and Thomas P. and Alice K. Kugelman, authors of a definitive study on Connecticut River Valley furniture.

1816459	A Woman Called Iran, a Refuge Called America	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E0DF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	My Name Is Iran A Memoir By Davar Ardalan Illustrated. 323 pages. Henry Holt & Company. $24.\nIran Davar Ardalan, the author of ''My Name Is Iran,'' has spent her life bouncing back and forth between America and Iran, torn between these two poles in her family history, always finding herself an outsider in both countries, always missing one nation's traditions and ideals when living in the other.\nAs a high school student Ms. Ardalan -- who dropped her first name, Iran, after anti-Iranian sentiments blossomed in America in the wake of the hostage-takings in 1979 -- entered a beauty contest in Massachusetts and posed ''like Brooke Shields in her famous Calvin Klein ad''; within a few years she had moved to Iran, donned the veil and entered into an arranged marriage with a man she hardly knew. She attended a mass audience with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and chanted his name, lost in the moment ''of the Islamic dream'' ; later, feeling suffocated by her marriage and disenchanted with the direction of the revolution, she moved back to the United States, where she eventually became a producer with National Public Radio.\nBy turns fascinating and frustrating, Ms. Ardalan's memoir is a case study of a book in desperate need of an editor. While compelling portraits of relatives are left curiously truncated and incomplete, the volume is padded with clumsily written, New Agey asides that should have been left on the cutting-room floor.\nThe reader wants to know more about Ms. Ardalan's memories of life under the shah and less about her early jobs in the United States; more about what she witnessed during the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and less about her quest to see ''the oneness of humanity.'' The book lacks the keen, reportorial eye that Azadeh Moaveni demonstrated in her 2005 book ''Lipstick Jihad: A Memoir of Growing Up Iranian in America and American in Iran,'' and it most definitely lacks the lyrical power of Azar Nafisi's remarkable 2003 book ''Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books.''\nWhat keeps the reader reading ''My Name Is Iran'' is the remarkable trajectory traced by members of three generations of Ms. Ardalan's family, as they moved back and forth between the East and West, Iran and America, trying to balance a personal equation of tradition and modernity, religious faith and individualistic freedom.\nThe story of her maternal grandfather, Abol Ghassem, is in itself a remarkable tale of perseverance and will. At the age of 40, Abol -- who grew up in a remote village in the Bakhtiari tribal area of Iran -- enrolled in the American Mission School, learned English alongside 7- and 8-year-olds, and eventually received a scholarship to study in America.\nAfter attending Columbia University, he joined a carnival (where he was billed as the ''Persian Lion'') to earn money for medical school, graduated from Syracuse University Medical School at 54, and married the author's grandmother Helen, a young nurse, who had grown up in a strict Christian home in a small town, Weiser, Idaho. The couple moved to Iran in 1931, rented a large Tehran house that doubled as their private hospital, and had seven children.\n''Their days began early in the morning,'' Ms. Ardalan writes, ''when Abol would rise at 4 a.m., shave his face and head, and listen to the BBC News on a shortwave radio. He would then do laps around the balcony for 20 minutes. As he ran, he recited the 'Shahnameh' '' -- an Arthurian-like epic about Iran's early kings -- ''to himself. Then, summer or winter, he would wake the children and line them up under the shower as he continued to chant to them from the 'Shahnameh.' ''\nHelen and Abol eventually decided that their children should be raised in the United States, and the author's mother, Mary Nell -- the one child not given a Persian name -- was sent to a private boarding school in Washington. At 19 she met a Kurdish aristocrat named Nader Ardalan on a blind date; she soon married him and a few years later moved with him to Iran, closely following the path her mother had chosen years before. Nader, a Harvard-educated architect, had accepted a job with the National Iranian Oil Company to design worker housing and later became an associate partner in a leading architectural firm in Tehran.\nIn discussing her childhood in Iran and her visits to America, Ms. Ardalan does a better job conveying her own sense of emotional dislocation than giving the reader a palpable appreciation of the two very disparate worlds she straddled. Her descriptions of life in Iran under the shah feel oddly generic and familiar: ''In our school many different cultures flourished, but for the most part we were all Americanized. By 1977, the Bee Gees's hit 'Night Fever' landed in Tehran, and 'Saturday Night Fever' was the big rage.''\nAnd her descriptions of the harshness of life in post-revolutionary Iran tend to have the impersonal feel of a wire report: ''Increasingly, the penalties imposed were gruesome and brutal. Under the penal code, the penalty for adultery for unmarried men and women was a hundred lashes of a whip.''\nToward the end of this ungainly book Ms. Ardalan asks: ''Could the telling of this story about Iran's search for a lawful society also be my conscious quest for my own identity as Iran, the woman?'' The problem is she never convinces the reader that her personal journey is more interesting than the plight of Iran, and in focusing too insistently on her own search for an identity, she seems to have squandered a splendid opportunity to give us a window on a conundrum of a country that she has known intimately through several tumultuous decades of change.\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES
1816460	Strange Love	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E0DF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	IT'S odd, the feeling of comfort you get staring up at a 103-foot-tall intercontinental ballistic missile from the bottom of a hardened silo buried in the Arizona desert.\nIt's not that there is any joy in knowing that an ICBM like this, the centerpiece of the Titan Missile Museum in Sahuarita, Ariz., about 20 miles south of Tucson, could have been launched in just 58 seconds, hurling a city-destroying nuclear warhead at the Soviet Union. Armageddon is not a pleasant prospect.\nNo, the sense of comfort in seeing a Titan II comes from knowing that it was never launched.\nDuring the heart of the cold war, from the 1960s to the mid-80s, the 54 Titan II underground complexes like this one -- with its blast doors, firing console and spartan crew quarters, all preserved as the Titan Missile Museum -- were part of the American program of nuclear deterrence, on constant alert to keep aggressive impulses in the Soviet Union at bay.\n''This is what it took to wage nuclear war,'' said Chuck Penson, the museum's archivist. ''And this is what it took to wage nuclear peace.''\nSince those days, both the enemy and the sense of what keeps the country secure have changed. In an age of color-coded threat levels, the cold war and concepts like mutual assured destruction can seem far away. But they are kept alive at museums and historical sites like the one in Sahuarita, relics of a recent bit of American history.\nI went to the Titan Museum, which is operated by the nonprofit Arizona Aerospace Foundation, on a quick trip back to that time. The journey, last fall, also took me to New Mexico, where the atomic bomb was invented, and Nevada, where it was perfected during more than three decades of atmospheric and underground testing.\nAtomic tourism is not for everyone. After all, the focal point is a weapon that can, and did, kill on a horrific scale. The technology tends to appeal to those with an interest in science and engineering or the military.\nBut if you are so inclined, you can see things that not too long ago were among America's best-kept secrets. Mr. Penson, whose long hair makes him look like anything but a military man, guides lengthy ''top to bottom'' tours of the Titan silo (shorter tours are available, too) and will show you every last detail, down to the safe that kept the launch codes that could start World War III. At the Nevada Test Site, the Department of Energy will proudly drive you through the ground zeros of its atomic wasteland.\nAlbuquerque is a good place to get introduced to the atomic age. It is home to the National Atomic Museum, which is owned by the Department of Energy, the federal agency that oversees the nuclear weapons program.\nThe museum has basic exhibits on topics like radiation and nuclear waste, a detailed explanation of the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atom bomb, and artifacts like a calutron, an electromagnetic machine for separating the bomb-quality isotope of uranium. Thousands of these were built during World War II, and since copper was scarce, more than 14,000 tons of silver were requisitioned from the government for the electromagnets.\nBut most of the museum is devoted to the modern nuclear arsenal (which, despite the end of the cold war, still includes thousands of warheads deliverable by more modern ICBMs, bombers and cruise missiles). If you've ever wanted to know what your basic H-bomb looks like (with the active ingredients removed, of course), this is the place.\nTHE Nevada Test Site, where nuclear bombs were tested from 1951 until 1992, is on nearly 1,400 square miles of dry lake beds and mountains 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas. While much classified work continues there (including testing to ensure that weapons remain safe as they age), the historical areas are now open once a month for free all-day bus tours -- an attempt by the Energy Department ''to educate the public about what really happened out there,'' said Roger Staley, who worked at the test site for 32 years as a health physicist.\nMr. Staley was speaking from the front of a tour bus, serving as guide for a group that included a retired airline pilot from Reno, a former school worker from Oregon, a nuclear power plant operator and members of a recreational-vehicle club from nearby Pahrump, Nev. Education is not a bad idea, given the history of the testing program, including the deliberate exposure of thousands of soldiers to atomic blasts.\nMr. Staley told his passengers that there was no radiation risk. He was required to wear a dosimeter only to keep the lawyers happy. Current radiation levels where they were going, he said, were somewhere between extremely little and none at ground level.\n''Beneath the ground,'' he said, ''is another matter.''\nOnce through a security checkpoint at the nuclear company town of Mercury, the bus wound its way up over a hill, past large ''Radiation Hazard'' signs and down into Frenchman Flat, where the first atmospheric tests (of 100 total) were conducted. Like all the tests conducted there, they had two purposes: to develop weapons and to determine their effects on life and property.\nEvidence of the second purpose was all around us. As the bus headed toward the site of a 37-kiloton blast in 1957, it drove past the mangled remains of several shelters made of aluminum. Nearby was a blasted bank vault, an experiment to see whether money and valuable documents could survive nuclear war. There were twisted I-beams from a section of a trestle bridge, large poles for testing window glass and concrete bunkers that looked relatively unscathed.\nThen there were the pig pens, where live pigs dressed in protective gear were exposed to blasts and examined to see how well the gear worked.\nNothing was spookier than the remains of the Apple 2 project, a 1955 explosion designed to test civil defenses. Parts of a small town were constructed for the test, with stores, cars and houses complete with refrigerators filled with food and mannequins dressed in clothing.\nMost of the debris from the test has been long since carted away, but a two-story house remains, about a mile from ground zero. It was weather-beaten and lacked windows and the chimney had been shifted off its foundation, but otherwise it seemed normal, just another abandoned building baking in the Nevada sun.\nAtmospheric testing was banned by treaty in 1963; from then until 1992, the site was the scene of more than 825 underground tests, most of which left subsidence craters on the surface.\nThe test site is so peppered with these craters that from some vantage points you'd think you were on the moon. The bus actually drove down into one: Bilby, created in 1963 by the detonation of a 249-kiloton bomb buried several thousand feet underground.\nAs craters go, however, none can match Sedan, in the northeast corner of the test site. The 1962 Sedan test was part of Operation Plowshare, a program to see if nuclear bombs could be used for peaceful purposes -- in this case, creating harbors or canals.\nA 104-kiloton hydrogen bomb left a crater 320 feet deep and about 1,300 feet wide -- a magnificent yawning space that can be viewed from a small platform at the edge.\nThe problem, Mr. Staley said, was that the explosion also sent a large plume of radioactive dust into the atmosphere. ''If we had known what would happen, we wouldn't have done the test,'' he said.\nThe Plowshare experiments were eventually discontinued.\nWITH more than 900 tests over four decades, it seems as if technicians must have been constantly detonating bombs at the Nevada Test Site. By contrast, at a Titan II silo, a nine-megaton W-53 warhead could sit atop a missile for years, waiting for a launch order that never came.\nAt the Titan Museum, Yvonne Morris, the director, who as a young Air Force missile crew commander in the early 80s worked 24-hour shifts at this and other silos, said the warhead was almost the last thing to worry about. The complex was full of equipment and systems that could, and did, fail.\nWhile on duty, ''I wasn't thinking about 'Is today the day I might have to fire the missile?' '' she said. ''I was thinking about: 'Is today the day that they're doing a propellant operation at my site? I really hate those, because so much can go wrong.' ''\nMr. Penson, Ms. Morris's colleague at the museum, may not have shared her military experience, but you'd never know it from the in-depth tours he leads -- he can describe practically every piece of equipment in the silo. He knows, for instance, that the diesel fuel tank for the emergency generator is about the only item that isn't shock-mounted. Just about everything else, from the light fixtures to the entire crew module to the missile itself, is suspended from springs, as protection from blast shock in the event the Soviets struck before the Titan could be launched.\nIn all, it's an impressive demonstration of technology -- granted, early '60s technology -- that was dedicated, at fabulous expense, to one goal: keeping the missile ready for a launching that the whole country hoped would not be needed.\n''Which was really the idea behind this,'' Mr. Penson said. ''To never use it.''\nCorrection: January 12, 2007, Friday A picture credit with an article last Friday about visits to Atomic Age sites misstated the photographer's given name.

Most of the Nike missile sites that once ringed New York, Philadelphia and Washington, ready to shoot down enemy planes that swooped too close, have been paved over or are capped off and overgrown with trees. But there are still places in the East that provide windows into the world of cold war defense.\nNew Jersey: Fort Hancock\nThis former army base at Sandy Hook, N.J., guarded New York Harbor until 1974 and is now part of the 26,000-acre Gateway National Recreation Area. With 24 nuclear warheads at one time, its arsenal was substantial. What remains are three unarmed missiles and an attendant radar site.\nFrom April through October, half-hour walking tours led by military veterans meet on weekends at the radar site's gate, and more comprehensive tours are given monthly. For details, call 732-872-5970 or check www.nps.gov/gate.\nWest Virginia: The Greenbrier\nAt this sprawling old resort in Sulphur Springs, W.Va., beyond what is today a spa and three golf courses, a 112,000-square-foot bunker was carved into the side of a mountain as the secret refuge for Congress in case of nuclear attack. Lawmakers were to cast votes in an air-locked, radiation-free complex and then bunk alongside their cross-the-aisle rivals upstairs.\nDespite its size and the presence of a secret staff disguised as TV repairmen, the bunker was unknown to even longtime Greenbrier employees until The Washington Post published an article about it in 1992. ''There were plenty of rumors,'' said Dr. Robert Conte, the resort's historian, who has worked there for 28 years, ''but I couldn't get them confirmed.''\nTours (age 10 and up) cost $20 and last about 90 minutes; no cameras are allowed. For reservations, call 800-453-4858.\nFlorida: Peanut Island\nOf course, the president needed fallout protection even if he was kicking back in Palm Beach, as John F. Kennedy often did. So a bunker came to the president, built on nearby Peanut Island. Though the exterior resembles an earthen Quonset hut, the inside is vintage Cuban missile crisis, with old cans of water, collapsible spoons and President Kennedy's desk.\nTours ($10) are conducted on weekends by the Palm Beach Maritime Museum (561-832-7428, www.pbmm.org).\nMassachusetts: Chesterfield\nA Grange hall, general store and 18th-century houses don't scream high-value target, but with a key interstate telephone line running through Chesterfield, a few miles west of Northampton, the government wasn't taking any chances. Outside town, a 40,000-square-foot bunker was buried 40 feet below ground in the early 1960s.\nToday it houses Chesterfield Custom, a manufacturer of vinyl organizers and other office products, though it retains details like toilets spring-mounted to absorb shocks in an attack.\nFrank Keefe, the company's chief executive, said that this bunker was where Richard Nixon's daughter Julie was to seek shelter if a war broke out while she was attending Smith College. ''There can be a blizzard going on, and you would never know it,'' Mr. Keefe said.\nYou can drive by 11 Bofat Hill Road, off East Street (Chesterfield Road), to judge for yourself.

Now I learn what it is. When they go visiting, they switch from being imperious hosts to demanding guest dieters.\nWho in their right mind puts up with such people -- guests who demand more culinary services from their hosts than they could expect at a five-star restaurant?\nMy wife and I had on several occasions invited a new business colleague for dinner. Only on the third visit did it transpire that he was vegetarian! He had gamely eaten the pork, beef and chicken that we had routinely served, without demur. Thanks to that gracious attitude, he was invited back often, and we gladly catered to that minor need. Had he attacked us for not divining his culinary peculiarities, his first invitation to dinner would have been his last.\nTom Holzel Boston\nTo the Editor: I read with interest and then irritation the article about the ''demanding guest diet.'' While I am sure there are plenty of humorous and frustrating stories out there, the other side was not represented. I am someone with strict dietary limitations; if I do not eat carefully, I cannot function, sometimes for days. I travel with my own food, knowing how much to bring and what can be prepared simply (I need a small space in a refrigerator and boiling water) so as not to be a burden. If I am invited to a restaurant, I simply study the menu ahead of time and call the restaurant so I do not demand an undue amount of attention. Others that I have known with similar restrictions have similar manners.\nIt is difficult enough in a society that idolizes the pleasure of eating to have such restrictions. We do not need articles that portray those with these limitations as inconveniences and only possessing poor manners.\nKaren Beaumont Milwaukee\nTo the Editor: One hostess, in order to avoid a drive to the grocery store, served caffeinated coffee and told guests it was decaffeinated. Another believes there is no space for a single box of cereal or Pop-Tarts, brought as backup by parents of young children. If these vignettes illustrate anything, it is that these passive-aggressive hosts are more demanding than their guests.\nHelen Feit, M.D. Villanova, Pa.
1816464	Snowbound Neverland	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EFDF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	SAM BUCKMELTER, who is 10 years old and lives in Denver, has spent most of his waking life studying the vainglorious snowboard acrobatics of the Great Ones -- riders like Danny Kass, Jeremy Jones and Andreas Wiig-- whose names and sponsors' logos are etched in the margins of his fifth-grade notebooks.\nSam aspires to ride with the goggle-tanned gods who throw slow-motion 900s off flesh-eating cliffs and drop out of helicopters to outride thundering avalanches. Given his dream, the path was clear. Sam convinced his parents to buy him a season pass to the new Neverland of freestyle stunt pilots, Echo Mountain Park, near Evergreen, Colo.\nPerched at 10,500 feet with wraparound views of the frosted Rockies, Echo is the nation's first winter resort devoted exclusively to the contagious urge to ''go huge'' and ''get your switch-front boardslides dialed.'' There are no gently groomed slopes, no wide cruiser runs, not even a single mogul field. Echo is 100 percent terrain park -- 50 acres of jumps, rails, boxes, picnic tables, stairs, mailboxes and pipe. With a good-times agenda, Echo aims to be the X Games proving ground for the young and indestructible.\nEcho, 35 miles west of Denver, bodaciously bills itself as ''the most exciting place to be with snow pants on.'' So on opening weekend in late November Sam Buckmelter came to guinea-pig the claim.\nHe and an army of bandana-masked snow desperadoes -- freestyle skiers and snowboarders jacked up on SoBe Full Throttle -- got their shred on until 9 p.m. under lights that blazed like a Swedish solstice. They pinwheeled across monster gaps and surfed curvaceous dragon rails in ''steezy'' hood ornament poses while Echo's jukebox rocked the freestyle world with their favorite thrasher tunes.\nFew parents could be found on the Echo slopes -- the energy, aesthetics, acoustics and entire ethos of the place is aimed at kids. Echo's owner, Jerry Petitt, said he hadn't built the park to please everyone. He has carved out a narrow, vigorous niche within the ski and snowboard market and is raising his newborn resort with a lot of parenting advice from the very 12- to 29-year-olds he hopes to serve. ''It's nothing against places like Aspen, but the young people we consulted early on told us they can't afford to pay $75 for a lift ticket or $14 for a buffalo burger,'' Mr. Petitt said. ''What kept coming back to us was: 'Keep it inexpensive. Make it for us.' ''\nThe lift tickets at Echo are priced for teenagers on a lawn-mowing budget, and the cuisine is spartan even by cafeteria standards: energy bars and nuke-able burritos from vending machines.\nMr. Petitt bought the Echo property in 2003 for a mere $700,000. It was just a small defunct ski hill in the midst of a wooded 240-acre lot then. ''I called my wife and said, 'We've just bought a ski area!' which went over really well,'' he said.\nStill a passionate skier at 61, Mr. Petitt invested $5 million to develop the first 50 acres into a terrain park, hiring Planet Snow Design, the company that built the superpipe for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games, to finesse the flow on each slope. They mixed boxes, stairs and rail sequences on one run, a medley of jumps and rocketing ''kickers'' on another. For rookies laying the foundations for their melon grabs and switch noseslides, they installed a ''progression center.''\n''We've got to let our riders create us,'' said Eric Petitt, 30, Jerry's son and the architect of Echo's guerrilla marketing campaign, which focuses on an interactive Web site with a ''rant'' page where kids weigh in on what they want Echo to be. He hopes to make Echo a year-round park, implementing the ideas generated in Echo's chat rooms -- rock climbing, mountain biking, all-terrain skateboarding, even zip-lining.\n''We're not going to build any million-dollar homes or stone-and-timber lodges strewn with bearskin rugs,'' said Doug Donovan, 34, the general manager, surveying his singularly young clientele swigging Red Bull while recharging by the Xbox at the base lodge. ''It's going to have a rock concert feel to it every day.''\nEcho's architecture makes creative use of pre-fab industrial design, with corrugated steel and glass jutting out at crisp angles. Underground snowboarding and freestyle ski brands like 4frnt, Unity and Capita are stickered liberally on chair backs, tables and garbage cans. The walls are hung with artwork by Denver area rider-artists -- a Japanese woodblock print of Mount Fuji with a snowboarder flying through the air, psychedelic abstracts painted on skateboards.\n''We looked at the industry and realized it's impossible to build a new Vail,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''Their model is a giant real estate play more than anything. But if you're looking to make money on the slopes, you build a skateboard park on snow, close to a metropolitan area.''\nAll the growth over the last five years, Mr. Donovan argued, has come from snowboarders, freestyle skiers and the terrain parks that reel them in. Conglomerates like Intrawest, Vail Corporation and American Skiing Company have gobbled up full-service winter resorts where affluent baby boomers spend as much time shopping at Ralph Lauren and dining on corn-fed elk as they do out on the blue and green groomer runs. That has opened the door for smaller, easy-to-get-to day slopes to attract young, underserved locals with more chutzpah and less cash.\nBEFORE starting Echo, Mr. Donovan and Jerry Petitt looked at a trio of resorts in California -- Bear Mountain, Boreal and Mountain High -- that converted their beginner and intermediate slopes into terrain parks and halfpipes over the last several years, tripling their number of visitors per acre. Other small-scale ski slopes like Mountain Creek Resort in Vernon, N.J., followed suit, and megaresorts from Killington to Mammoth dialed up the wattage on their trickster terrain. But Echo is the only resort to be built expressly for baby boomers' kids -- ''echo boomers'' like Sam Buckmelter.\nFiguring prominently in Sam Buckmelter's's personal pantheon of slope stylists are Pat Milbery and Chad Otterstrom. Both are professional shredders who came to Echo on Thanksgiving weekend to impart nuggets of launching and looping wisdom at a Pro Series Camp. ''There was nothing like Echo when I was a kid,'' lamented Mr. Milbery, 22. ''I learned how to ride by building jumps on the hill behind our house. This place is an incubator for the future of the sport -- it's going to spawn bazillions of talented young riders who'll invent moves we've never dreamed of!''\n''Yeah, if I'm still in one piece by the time I'm as old as you, Milbery!'' Sam Buckmelter said as he hiked up the hill. ''Right now I'm learning to pop off of jumps with steeze'' -- style -- ''but one day, I'm going to throw something big off of that.''\nThat is a 1961 Tucker Sno-Cat. Back in the day, it groomed this former mom-and-pop one-rope-tow hill. Echo's staff painted it an electric slime green and recycled it as the platform for a house rail, a trapezoid of logs with steel rails embedded in the tops. While the campers were working on their shred cred, Echo was christening the Sno-Cat rail by holding a jibbing contest (jibbing being the term for riding gantlets of obstacles embedded in the slopes) sponsored by Rome, a low-profile snowboard and apparel company with the advertising mantra ''Corrosion of the Corporate.''\nTen brothers of the board were swarming around the Sno-Cat, taking turns shredcasting the contest with a handheldmike.\n''Next rider steppin' up is Lance Machado out of Breckenridge, Co-lo-ra-do,'' one brother drawled with snow gangsta elocution. ''This jibber is comin' in fast, firin' it up, takin' it air borne! Pullin' a corked three outta the hat.'' (Read: helicoptering 360 degrees on a tipped axis.) ''That, my friends, is Lance-the-Ripper!''\nMr. Machado, the stringy 19-year-old who won the contest, favors a sartorial style borrowed from pioneer punk rockers like Iggy Pop and the Ramones -- skinny jeans and tight striped T-shirts -- placing him in a sectarian group within the soul-patched, hip-hop-influenced snowboard tribe: the sub-subculture sometimes derogatively labeled Emos. ''I always hear, 'Are those pants painted on or something?' from what I call the 'food court gangstas,' '' Mr. Machado said.\nThe politics of shred fashion are murky. But there is a shared ethic behind Mr. Machado's punk-chic and the standard saggy pants and XXL parkas: Both are anti-brand and, if possible, label averse. It's a culture of irreverent individualism to which the Echo design team is acutely sensitive.\nLoud banners advertising overexposed corporate brands (Burton, Salomon, Oakley) are shunned here. Only the Echo insignia is stamped on the park's centerpiece, a 23-foot-high structure shaped like a Stomp Rocket called Knuckles that riders and skiers slide up, flip off and soar over.\n''Without a doubt, there'll be some carnage off of it,'' said Marc Vitelli, who helped design Knuckles. ''For those who dare ride up it, it's game on -- anything can happen!'' he shouted as a twin-tip skier popped off the hip, arcing backward, arms outspread, a snowboarding Greg Louganis tracing the sky with his fingertips. Seconds later, the rider lawn-chaired (collapsed) on impact.\n''Insufficient rotation'' was Mr. Vitelli's critique, though he whooped approvingly. The only way to learn how to stomp tricks, he said, is by going huge and embracing the occasional yard sale (a total wipeout that litters gear all over the slope).\nAlas, there are no heated pools at Echo to soak battered body parts at the end of the day, and in fact no overnight facilities at this stage. ''Unless you want to crash on my couch,'' offered Mr. Vitelli, who lives in Evergreen. Eventually, Echo may add a youth hostel-style bunkhouse to spare its customers multiple laps driving up and down the steep, sometimes treacherous 12-mile road between Evergreen and the resort.\nBut Echo has its advantages. Set in the front range of the Rockies, it typically gets late snows that can last until May. And unlike most Colorado resorts, it isn't on Forest Service land, so there's no regulated close date. Most riders won't complain about the drive back and forth from Denver, since they'll completely bypass the I-70 parking lot of weekend skier traffic, and pay less than half the price of tickets at the ski-tropolises on the other side of the conga line.\nStill, Echo isn't likely to spark a flood of émigrés from stodgy megaresorts. But for the Sam Buckmelters who are coming up at a time when freestyle skiing and boarding are gaining legitimacy, Echo could be the fuse that lights the next revolution in snow sliding.\n''I'm stoked,'' Sam said.\nBOARD AND MORE\nECHO MOUNTAIN PARK (303-325-7347; www.echomountainpark.com), 35 miles from Denver, is open daily from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Lift tickets are $25 on weekdays, $35 on weekends (less if you buy in ''six-packs'' or ''three-packs'') and $20 after 4 p.m.\nBoards, boots and twin-tip skis can be rented from Echo's Garage, the park's retail and rental shop, for $25 a day.\nEvents are held every weekend, like the Shut Up and Snowskate competition tomorrow and the Armashreddin' Colorado versus Colorado State battle on Jan. 20. The Sports Monster League on Wednesday nights is billed as the first social snow-sports league in Colorado.\nSKI REPORT
1816465	HAVENS | Panama City Beach, Fla.; A Vacation Town Tries to Take Off Its Blue Collar	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EFDF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	LIKE a supermodel showing off her good side, Panama City Beach is not shy about flaunting its most valuable asset. ''The World's Most Beautiful Beaches,'' boasts the sign at the end of Hathaway Bridge, which leads into the city.\nBut anyone driving through this resort on the Florida Panhandle can't fail to notice the honky-tonk strip on the main drag, Thomas Drive: video arcades, body piercing shops, tattoo parlors, adult novelty shops, down-at-the-heels motels, vacant lots. All this, city boosters insist, is the old Panama City Beach.\nFix your gaze directly across the street at the high-rise condominiums stacked like dominoes on the dunes. This is the resort's new face, with units in the most exclusive buildings selling for as much as $1.5 million. Here and there are the old narrow, two-story mom-and-pop motels that date from the 1940s and 1950s. But most have been bulldozed. Signs of change are everywhere, from the construction crews clogging the roads to the soaring cranes that hover above the clear emerald waters and white beaches of the Gulf of Mexico.\nLike much of Florida, Panama City Beach has been hurt by the downturn in the real estate market. But what sets the resort apart is the planned construction -- scheduled to begin in late spring-- of a $330 million international airport to replace the outdated Panama City-Bay County International Airport. The new airport, scheduled to open in late 2009, will have longer runways to handle larger jets, opening the resort to more domestic and international markets.\nCurrently, 83 percent of the city's four million tourists arrive by car. With the new airport, that will change. And Panama City Beach is betting that the new visitors filling those jets will have money to spend.\n''We're going from what used to be a blue-collar resort and sharing that with a higher-end customer,'' said Bob Warren, president of the Panama City Beach Convention & Visitors Bureau.\nThat housing prices are still low compared with Florida's other coastal resorts has also caught the attention of real estate investors. ''This is like an undiscovered little gold mine right now,'' said Mark McSparin, an investor from Charleston, Ill., who has bought several dozen condos in Panama City Beach in the last three years and who has his own condo there.\nThe Scene\nEven in peak summer season, the area's 17-plus miles of beach are rarely crowded. ''It's not like Coney Island, where you're stepping all over each other,'' said Patricia Remer, a native New Yorker who now lives in Birmingham, Ala. Mrs. Remer bought a three-bedroom, two-bath house one block off the beach in 2001 for $113,000, which she has on the market for $249,000. She plans to move to a waterfront condo so she can walk out her door and feel the sand between her toes.\n''It's so peaceful,'' she said. ''I get my umbrella, my chair, a bottle of water and a book, and I could just stay there forever.''\nIn winter, the families from Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee retreat to make way for snowbirds from the Upper Midwest and Canada, most of whom rent condos for a few months. Some even swim in the chilly waters, which shocks local residents. ''I guess it's hot to them,'' said Jack Mashburn, a longtime resident of the county. ''Nobody here would dare put a foot in the gulf in February.''\nJust off the beach, on the strip, are family activities that range from amusement parks and go kart tracks to water parks and miniature golf. A Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum opened last summer. And there are alligators, stingrays and performing dolphins at Gulf World Marine Park.\nIf you can get past the restaurants shaped like pirate ships and seafood places with names like Captain Crabby's, there are plenty of chances to commune with nature. The beach is flanked by state parks with pristine coastline, walking trails and fishing. Boating on the gulf is popular, as is fishing for flounder, trout, redfish, snapper and grouper. You can swim with dolphins for $49 a person. There are airboat tours of nearby rivers and marshes.\nPanama City Beach has had a reputation for years as a spring-break destination for college students, although it has faded somewhat as the old motels disappear and the owners of condo buildings set strict rules. ''Spring breakers are a lot better behaved,'' said Patrick Pfeffer, who owns Club La Vela. ''You don't see as much nudity and throwing TVs out of the windows.''\nYou can still kiss your quiet time goodbye in March, though, when the beach is jam-packed with college students dancing to live bands and playing volleyball. Club La Vela, which has a capacity of 6,000 indoors and outdoors, books national acts like Aerosmith and Stone Temple Pilots and is periodically host to MTV. Spinnaker Beach Club holds 2,000 revelers.\nPros\nExcept for spring break, Panama City Beach is family-oriented. Rosemary Butler, of Dallas, Ga., remembers traveling to Panama City with her parents in the 1950s when Thomas Drive was a dirt road. After two condos, she and her husband bought a single-family house so they could be host to their extended family. ''We buzz across the street in our golf cart, go to our boat and take off,'' Mrs. Butler said.\nCons\nMost residents welcome the changes, but some are unhappy that high-rises have obliterated the dunes and blocked the gulf view from the street. A few buildings tower 35 stories above the sand, but rules put into effect two years ago now limit buildings to 22 stories. ''If I had my choice, we would never have built anything on the beach side of the street,'' said the city's mayor, Gayle Oberst. ''But we're 50 years too late.''\nWayne Kirby, also of Dallas, Ga., misses the relaxed pace of the days before high-rises. He started vacationing in Panama City Beach in the 1950s, staying with his family in one of the old mom-and-pop motels. He bought a condo in a two-story building on the beach in 1987 for $67,000, but finally sold it last November after years of pressure from developers. It will be torn down to make way for another high-rise.\n''We were so happy where we were,'' Mr. Kirby said. ''We could sit on our deck and watch the grandkids play on the beach and not have to worry about them. I'm not against growth, but I believe the growth has gotten out of hand.''\nThe Real Estate Market\nAs the number of unsold properties grows -- there are 2,000 condos in Panama City Beach for sale, according to Katie Patronis, a broker for Century 21 Ryan Realty-- construction of new units continues. Although four projects were delayed in 2006 and 12 postponed, another 22 are under way, said Mr. Warren of the visitors bureau; altogether, that's almost 7,000 units.\nUnits stay on the market an average of 180 days before being sold.\nPeople who bought a condo in the pre-construction stage two years ago, Ms. Patronis said, ''are closing on their property now and paying more than what it's worth.'' Sales of existing condo units were down 45 percent in 2006, she said, but sales of new condos were up by 3 percent.\nThe median price of a condo in Panama City Beach is $316,000, up from $118,000 in 2000. But that's down from the peak of $385,000 in 2005.\nPrices range from $150,000 for a studio or a unit not facing the gulf to $2 million. A single-family home a half-mile from the beach is about $150,000. New three-story, Key West-style houses near the beach are $450,000 to $500,000. Three-bedroom single-family houses in the Martinique development, on an artificial lake, start at $500,000.\nBut no matter how skittish investors are, city officials and real estate professionals in the long run see nothing but blue skies over an emerald sea. ''The market will take care of itself,'' said Mayor Oberst. ''The northwest part of Florida has been discovered. Everybody wants to live here.''\nLAY OF THE LAND\nPOPULATION -- 11,477, according to a 2005 estimate by the Census Bureau. In peak season, the population rises to at least 35,000, according to the city's planning and zoning department.\nSIZE -- About seven square miles, according to Census figures.\nWHO'S BUYING -- Families with young children and baby boomers nearing retirement. Most come from cities like Atlanta, Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Tenn., and Louisville, Ky.\nGETTING THERE -- Panama City Beach is about 130 miles west of Tallahassee and 95 miles east of Pensacola. The nearest major highway is Interstate 10. From the north, take Route 231 south, which crosses Interstate 10, then take Route 98 west for about six miles.\nWHILE YOU'RE LOOKING -- The Bay Point Marriott Resort (4200 Marriott Drive, 850-236-6000; www.marriottbaypoint.com) is on the bay.

1816466	A Revised Edition	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405EEDF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	MAYA ANGELOU has lived in New York many times. She has had apartments in Brooklyn and on Central Park West and Riverside Drive. But three years ago she decided it was time to buy a brownstone in Harlem.\nIt was to be a retreat from her full-time residence, an 18-room house in Winston-Salem, N.C., where she is the Reynolds professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University. Ms. Angelou wanted a space in which to entertain her legions of friends in New York, dating from her first visit to the city in the early 1950s. Unlike most second-home owners, she was looking for a getaway to the city -- not from it. And she soon found it.\n''This was the first and only house I looked at,'' she said one mild morning in December as she sat in her breakfast nook in Harlem, sipping a glass of ice water and looking chic in a V-neck black velvet chemise and a triple strand of freshwater pearls, her gently curled salt and pepper hair framing her unlined face. She used the verb loosely. In fact, no one had ''looked at'' the four-story brownstone at all. Longtime friends, the musicians Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, caught wind of this landmark property for sale and placed a $10,000 deposit on it for her. Built in 1881, the house is nearly 4,000 square feet and sits on a historic block of 120th Street in the Mount Morris Park neighborhood, the most-sought-after area in Harlem.\nBut it was a decrepit wreck and tied up in litigation as well. Competing claims took two years to sort out. ''I got the house, and then I saw what I got,'' said Ms. Angelou, 78, speaking in her trademark majestically enunciated syllables with enough space between them for the drama of the tale to sink in. ''It had been vandalized and rained in; there was no floor between the first and second stories and no stairs. A lot of the wainscoting and the newel post were buried under debris in the backyard with nine coats of paint on them.'' At that low point, she intoned wryly, her performer's voice dropping to great effect, ''I owned an address.''\nIt took a gut renovation to turn the shell into the stunning, high-ceilinged home it is today, with five bedrooms, three full bathrooms and two half bathrooms. ''I was blessed and highly favored, and it only took nine months to finish,'' Ms. Angelou said with some awe, still finding such a timely transformation hard to believe.\nHer own well-publicized transformation is far more remarkable -- from her dirt-poor childhood in Stamps, Ark., to her current iconic literary prominence, by way of California, Egypt, Ghana and finally North Carolina. The best-selling first volume of her autobiography ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' is required reading for millions of American students; her collection of poems ''Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Diiie'' was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. She has written, produced, directed and starred in productions for stage, film and television, and has long been a civil rights activist.\nHer front parlor is not unlike Ms. Angelou herself: vivid and a little larger than life (though a bit frail, she is six feet tall). Oversize armchairs and couches are upholstered in raw silk in shades of lime, tangerine, cherry, grape and bright yellow. The grouping gives new meaning to the phrase eye candy, but it wasn't candy Ms. Angelou had in mind when she chose them. ''I wanted the room to look like a bowl of summer fruit,'' she said. And to accentuate the point, a bowl of perfectly formed glass fruit in jewel-like colors sits in the center of a marble-topped table, topped by a single glass cherry.\nThe house is 20 feet wide and 50 feet deep. The dining room is behind the parlor, dominated by a round glass-topped table that seats 10 in bright red lacquered chairs. Painted clouds drift overhead on the light blue ceiling. Ms. Angelou still enjoys cooking in the well-equipped kitchen off the dining room; steak and kidney pie with mashed potatoes is a favorite. At the back of the house is her favorite spot, the breakfast nook -- sunlit and painted marigold with terra cotta-colored trim. From its black-and-white checkered farm table, she fields calls, jots on ever-present yellow legal pads and issues instructions to her assistant, Lydia Stuckey, who lives and travels with her, staying in a ground-floor bedroom when they are at the Harlem house. Ms. Angelou loves several other spaces in her house, but, she says, ''Sooner or later, I end up back here.''\nTHESE days, the nook occasionally serves as a studio for her newest venture: a weekly talk show on the Oprah & Friends Channel on XM Satellite Radio. ''It's the first radio show I've had,'' she said, gesturing to a pair of headphones and a pile of audio taping equipment stacked nearby. Sex, religion, race, music and food are all fodder for the program.\nAn elegant stairway arises from the front entryway, although an elevator carries Ms. Angelou to the blue master bedroom (years of professional dancing have taken a toll on her hips and knees). A 46-inch TV faces her crisply dressed king-size bed, and a 15-foot bay window framed by burgundy brocade draperies overlooks 120th Street. A glimpse outside reveals a row of Victorian lampposts lining the block, which carry red banners that proclaim ''Welcome to Mount Morris Park Historic District.'' Another bedroom serves as a dressing room.\nOn the top floor are a laundry room and the two other bedrooms, where Ms. Angelou's son Guy Johnson, 61, and his family, stay when they visit from Oakland, Calif. For their Christmas visit, Ms. Angelou planned a special treat for her two great-grandchildren, Caylin Johnson, 8, and Brandon Bailey Johnson, 5 -- a lighted seven-foot figure from ''The Nutcracker'' in the yard.\nInside, eye-catching artifacts of rarer quality are on display everywhere. They vary from luminous paintings of African women ferrying babies in slings to charming drawings of little African-American girls wearing yarn ribbons in their hair, resembling illustrations from the 1950s. African masks, quilts, photographs and sculpture sit on tables, hang on walls, line stairways. Collages by Phoebe Beasley are scattered through the rooms. ''I bought most of the sculpture in Ghana 45 years ago, and I've been collecting Phoebes since the early 1970s,'' Ms. Angelou said.\nThere are works, too, by the Harlem artist Romare Bearden. A 4-by-7-foot fabric piece by Faith Ringgold, who specializes in painted story quilts, was a gift from Oprah Winfrey that was commissioned for Ms. Angelou's 60th birthday. And awaiting proper placement upstairs is a framed two-page newspaper spread that appeared in The New York Times on Jan. 21, 1993, including a photograph of Ms. Angelou delivering her poem ''On the Pulse of Morning,'' written for the inauguration of President Bill Clinton.\nMs. Angelou's neighborhood is one of the most gentrified in Harlem. The actress Marcia Gay Harden and her family live nearby. Three total renovations are under way on Ms. Angelou's block, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has bought another house on the street. Contractors hold sidewalk conferences all day long. Emperor's Roe, a caviar and wine bar and fine-foods shop, and Settepani, an upscale bakery cafe, are nearby. And Sylvia's, the legendary soul-food restaurant that is one of Ms. Angelou's favorite spots, is not far.\nTHIS is a neighborhood where ravaged brownstones bought for $67,000 in 1996 sold for $500,000 this year, said Willie Kathryn Suggs, owner of Willie Kathryn Suggs Harlem Real Estate. Ms. Angelou declined to divulge what she paid when she bought her New York house in 2003, but Harlem real estate brokers said that similar properties (in similarly horrible shape) were selling for a minimum of $500,000 at the time. ''Hundreds of thousands of dollars went into her renovation,'' Ms. Suggs added. ''With the celebrity factor and the landmark status, I'd list her property at $3.4 million today.''\nHarlem real estate agents see Ms. Angelou herself as an agent of change -- ''She's a god here,'' Ms. Suggs said. And Ms. Angelou seems to live easily with her fame in this milieu. As a tour bus lumbered down her street she acknowledged that yes, they know where she lives. ''Sometimes people get out and pose for photographs on the steps!'' she said with some wonderment.\nNever a fan of flying, she has given it up nearly entirely because, she said, smiling and shaking her head slightly, ''I've become very well known. I look a lot like Maya Angelou. People come up and throw their babies into my arms.'' But she gets around on a private coach bus that sleeps six, piloted by a professional driver. Decorated in kente cloth, with its own doorbell, the bus serves as Ms. Angelou's other home away from home. When she's in Manhattan, it's parked in New Jersey.\nShe makes the trip to New York every two or three months, staying from a few days to a week or more, a rhythm that feels exactly right. ''I stay away long enough so that when I come back it is new and familiar at the same time,'' she explained. Her Harlem house is much more than a vacation place or a simple change of scenery. It's a true second home.\n''I never agreed with Thomas Wolfe,'' she remarked quietly. ''I never thought you can't go home again. I've been coming home to Harlem for 50 years.''\nAWAY\nCorrection: January 12, 2007, Friday A picture caption with an article last Friday about the writer Maya Angelou's part-time home in New York misstated the number of its rooms. It has 12 rooms -- not 18, which is the number of rooms in her home in Winston-Salem, N.C.
1816467	You Can Find Memories of Cousin Lou, if His Last Name Was Gehrig	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04EEDF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	MY grandfather, Theodore Anton Gehrig Sr., was Lou Gehrig's first cousin.\nWhen I was a girl, Grandpa would tell us that when he was growing up in Milwaukee, he'd go to Lou's games whenever Lou passed through town on barnstorming tours. Grandpa, who's been gone awhile, used to say that I should write Eleanor, Lou's widow. I wish I'd done it -- but I didn't want to seem as if I were being greedy or wanted something from her.\nSo today, we don't have anything from Lou through the family. But there's eBay. In fact, I wish I'd started with it earlier.\nBefore, it was hard to find Lou Gehrig stuff here in Wisconsin, although sometimes I'd find specialty shops with things like limited-edition plates or ornaments. My sister would also try to find stuff, but she's not into it as much as I am. Here at my house in Racine, we have a room downstairs with all the Lou Gehrig memorabilia I've bought off eBay. The mailman is probably getting mad at me by now.\nWe have about 75 items, including figurines, books, old newspaper articles and advertisements featuring Lou, items with Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth together -- all things I want to pass on to my children. My dad, who's 81, is excited about it. He didn't collect Lou Gehrig stuff when he was younger; he had a hard enough time raising eight of us kids. My family, especially my mom and my aunt, likes to see the new stuff I've gotten every time they come by. The pictures are all up on the wall, and in one of the bedrooms I have a shelf with all the books and figurines.\nI get a lot of e-mail from eBay sellers who see my name and ask me if I'm related to Lou. They're surprised that I am, since Lou didn't have any brothers or sisters who made it past childhood, and also because he and Eleanor didn't have any children. Grandpa's dad was a brother of Lou's dad. It's a distant relationship, but it's there. The eBay sellers seem glad when something they sell goes to the Gehrig family.\nI spend a couple of hours online every day and check my auctions about four times a day. Sometimes, when I see something with Lou's name on it, I think to myself, ''Wow, that's my name up there.''\nThe first item I ever purchased was a gold coin with Lou's picture on it, but one of the items I cherish most is a photo of him giving his farewell speech on Lou Gehrig Day. He's at home plate, scratching his head, and all of the old-time microphones are there. The photo isn't an original print, but it's a limited edition.\nI've also got a Lou Gehrig pocketknife, a talking Christmas ornament and a picture of Lou dressed up as a cowboy in the 1938 Western ''Rawhide.'' He looks real funny dressed in leather like that.\nOf the newspaper ads, one has Lou selling Williams Shaving Cream, which was supposed to ''take the starch out of whiskers.'' Another is of him selling Camel cigarettes. Then there's one for Royal Crown Cola that says the soda was Lou's secret for hitting home runs.\nI've got a 1932 newspaper from when the Yankees beat the Chicago Cubs in the World Series.\nI couldn't believe it when I first saw them, but now I also have three different bobbleheads. They're all in their boxes, and that's where they're going to stay. I want to get an autographed ball one day, but those are getting pretty high-priced. They go for about $10,000 each. Maybe I'll win the lottery.\nMy husband, Mike, is a big Cubs fan, but he's gotten me more into collecting stuff about Lou. We argue over the Cubs and the Yankees all the time. I argue for the Yankees, of course, because of the family.\nWe have two kids who already carry on the pride of the family name. The eBay stuff is for them to have. Our son, Felix Theodore Mireles III, is 25, married and expecting his first child. He's named after my dad and Grandpa.\nMy daughter, Amanda, who's 22, has been through a lot in her short life. She's had Hodgkin's lymphoma, avascular necrosis and cancer and has had chemo, radiation and a bone-marrow transplant. Through all that, she went to college and had a son, but he passed away after fighting hard for 13 days. We say that he had Lou's strength to hang on that long. Everyone called him the ''miracle boy.'' It is so amazing to me to watch my child go though all of this and be so very strong. She definitely has the Gehrig courage and talks about using the Gehrig name as a middle name if she has another child.\nIt may be hard to believe, but I have never been to Yankee Stadium or visited Lou's grave in Valhalla, N.Y. I absolutely hope to do it someday. I'm very proud of the family name. That's one of the reasons why I kept my maiden name. I come from a long line of courageous and humble people. That's why I admire Lou's humility. He was very humble, a great man.\nI think of my father that way, and I think of my grandfather that way too. I wish I asked my grandfather more questions about him and Lou when I was growing up.\nAs you get older, things like that mean a lot more.\nRITUALS
1816468	When a Woman Rattles A Man's World of Fraud	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EEDF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	''Comedy of Power'' is the name of Claude Chabrol's latest film to be released in the United States, but the phrase could describe much of this director's work. Though his films tend to be witty and ironical rather than laugh-out-loud funny, they often concern themselves with the behavior and misbehavior -- both intimate and public -- of the French ruling classes.\nCriminality plays a large role in Mr. Chabrol's view of the world, but rather than moralize, he treats his characters with a wry mixture of sympathy and cynicism. His touch is characteristically light, as if in defiance of the gravity of the stories he has occasion to tell, and his sensibility is aphoristically summed up by one of the characters in ''Comedy of Power,'' who suggests that ''nothing is serious, and everything is tragic.''\nThis highly arguable observation gains a great deal by being said in French, with a smile, by a good-looking man (the actor is Mr. Chabrol's 43-year-old son, Thomas) who has abandoned the possibility of an important administrative career to become a part-time maker of crossword puzzles.\n''Comedy of Power'' takes its inspiration from the Elf Aquitaine scandal of the 1990s, which exposed extensive corruption in France's giant gas company, then state owned. The judge who led the Elf investigation, Eva Joly, is clearly the model for Jeanne Charmant Killman. Played by Isabelle Huppert, who has become something of a fixture in Mr. Chabrol's cinematic universe, Jeanne is both admirable in her dedication and perhaps a little scary in her zeal.\nHer first target is Michel Humeau (François Berléand), the director of a large company who never quite recovers from the shock and humiliation of being handcuffed, locked in a cell and otherwise treated like an ordinary criminal. Through his ordeal he repeats the plaintive rhetorical question that arises when influence turns into impotence: ''Don't you know who I am?''\nJeanne knows perfectly well, and in due course this unfortunate bigwig's cronies, connections and superiors arrive, one by one, in her office. Like him, they try to flirt, flatter, threaten and condescend their way out of trouble. Mr. Chabrol's discreet, prying camera takes note of the red filaments threaded into the lapels of their flashy suits -- symbols of their membership in the Legion of Honor. Jeanne has only a cherished pair of red gloves, a token of retail feminine vanity rather than state-sanctioned masculine self-importance.\nThese chévaliers of the Republic act like made guys in a Hollywood Mafia picture, conspiring over brandy and cigars and resorting to thuggishness when their oily attempts at charm fall short. The nature of their crimes is of less interest to Mr. Chabrol than the forms and protocols that guide their exercise of power, and their attempts to defend their imperiled privileges.\nThere is some talk of kickbacks and financial schemes, but procedural boilerplate is not really the point. Jeanne is sure that the targets of her investigation are guilty, and we are happy to accept her certainty as a warrant: how could they not be?\nBut public malfeasance is less the subject of the movie than its premise. It is not really a courtroom drama, or the stirring tale of a crusader against wrong, so much as it is the psychological portrait of an ambitious professional woman in a society still very much dominated by male prerogatives. Jeanne's antagonists, used to pampering mistresses and deceiving wives, try to derail her with displays of chivalry and bald-faced lies as well as threats of violence, which they are too delicate to convey themselves.\nThe comedy arises in the confrontations between these fat cats and their sparrowlike tormentor, who is both punctilious with regard to legal procedure and capricious in the exercise of authority. ''No smoking in my office,'' she snaps, only to light up herself a few scenes later. At one point the bad guys arrange to have another female judge (Maryline Canto) assigned to the case, hoping for a bureaucratic catfight and forgetting the old feminist chestnut that sisterhood is powerful.\nMr. Chabrol's observations of modern French sexual politics extend beyond Jeanne's office into her home. Her husband (Robin Renucci), who is a doctor (and also the son of a wealthy and powerful family), complains that his colleagues call him ''Monsieur Jeanne Charmant Killman,'' and his wife's highly public, possibly dangerous job soon places their marriage under a heavy strain, which pumps a bit of melodrama into the film's otherwise dry air.\nAs ever, Mr. Chabrol's style is delicate and precise. ''Comedy of Power'' is not his deepest or most ambitious film, and its stance of knowing resignation in the face of corruption can feel a little glib. But Ms. Huppert's ferocity compensates for the director's detachment; no French actress is as riveting to watch once the gloves come off.\nComedy of Power Opens today in Manhattan.\nDirected by Claude Chabrol; written (in French, with English subtitles) by Odile Barski and Mr. Chabrol; director of photography, Eduardo Serra; edited by Monique Fardoulis; music by Matthieu Chabrol; production designer, Françoise Benoit-Fresco; produced by Patrick Godeau; released by Koch Lorber Films. At the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas at Third Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 110 minutes. This film is not rated.\nWITH: Isabelle Huppert (Jeanne), François Berléand (Humeau), Patrick Bruel (Sibaud), Robin Renucci (Philippe), Maryline Canto (Erika) and Thomas Chabrol (Félix).\nFILM REVIEW
1816469	No Place for a Zamboni: A Hockey Rink Where Players Sink	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03EEDF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	IN the raw context of the human condition, of life and survival on this planet, all sports are unnecessary, silly even.\nBut underwater hockey -- a sport incorporating lead pucks, stout wooden sticks, rubberized gloves, snorkels, face masks and bulbous ear guards -- is in a realm of its own.\nUnderwater hockey, indeed, is a sport that begs legitimization in even the most innocent passing reference, said Bryna Nielsen, a member of the United States national team. ''No one's ever heard of it,'' she said, ''and when you explain what you do, people just say 'What?' ''\nMs. Nielsen, a 21-year-old student from Amery, Wis., has played since she was a toddler. Her prowess rose during high school, where holding her breath while pushing a three-pound puck across the pool bottom with a foot-long stick became natural. In the last five years Ms. Nielsen has traveled extensively to play in tournaments.\n''I love the team aspects, the camaraderie,'' she said of the sport, which is played six to eight feet underwater in a bubbly, muffled silence.\nWhile variations exist, a common match is 30 minutes long and includes six swimmers per team kicking, diving, defending and sucking fast gulps of air through snorkel tubes. The simple premise of the game -- to push the puck into the opposing team's goal -- is complicated by the medium. Underwater, communication is tough. The puck travels just a few feet per swipe, quickly slowed by the water's resistance.\nAnd then there's the whole issue of breathing.\n''Good teams have a rhythm, a Zen,'' said Ben Erickson, captain of the Minnesota Loons, a club team in Minneapolis. Mr. Erickson has played underwater hockey almost every week for 25 years. ''You just know or sense where your guys are, up or down or getting a breath.''\nA main challenge of the game, Mr. Erickson said, is communication.\nLow bubbly grunts and taps of the stick on the bottom of the pool are common devices. Ms. Nielsen screams through her snorkel to get attention, she said.\nLung capacity is important, though holding your breath for long periods of time is not a required skill. Rather, players who consistently swim up and down for the whole match -- alternatively grabbing gulps of air and attacking the puck below -- are most effective. ''The rhythm is all about breathing and then dropping to the bottom; breathing, dropping to the bottom,'' Mr. Erickson said.\nLast August, five members of the Minnesota Loons traveled to Sheffield, England, to compete in the two-week-long Underwater Hockey World Championships, where Mr. Erickson's Zen strategies helped the United States take gold in the Men's Masters division.\nUnderwater hockey -- called just ''hockey'' by its participants -- is played by about 1,000 people in the United States, according to Gregory Appling, a director with the Underwater Society of America, which serves as underwater hockey's governing body. Club teams dot the map, from Sacramento to Sandwich, Mass.\nInternationally, the sport is big in Britain, where it was invented in the 1950s by a group of divers looking for an off-season training regimen. New Zealand, Australia, France and South Africa have strong underwater hockey scenes, Mr. Appling said, adding that numbers are on the rise: ''It's a sport you can play competitively into your 50s or 60s, so many of the veterans stick around while new people continue to come try it out.''\nA POOL of deep translucent blue framed 12 members of the Minnesota Loons last week at the University of Minnesota's Aquatic Center, where the team met for a scrimmage. The game began at 7:30 p.m. on the dot.\n''Sticks up, go!'' a player yelled to start the match, prompting a mad swim to the center of the pool. A pink puck sat undisturbed on the bottom 8 feet down and in the middle of the 75-foot-long pool.\nFins kicked up in unison near the middle, green, red, black and pink rubber wings cresting like whale tails before the teams dove.\nBubbles percolated around the mass.\nThen silence.\nPlayers swam in circles, heads looking down. Snorkels poked up quietly. Splashing was minimal.\n''All the action is underwater,'' said Karen Nielsen, the team's self-described hockey mom, who was sitting at the edge of the pool. ''They use the JumboTron screen with underwater cameras during important games.''\nA lap swimmer from an adjacent pool walked over, toweling himself off. ''Are they looking for a weighted ball?'' he asked, dumbstruck.\nBut underwater, viewed through a face mask from the sidelines, the game's athleticism was easily seen. Twelve stick-wielding players crowded at a midfield play, bodies twisting, contorting, reaching for the puck. Swimmers dived up and down.\nThe puck skipped and jumped from stick to stick, moving down the pool toward a 10-foot-wide underwater goal. Bubbles leaked from snorkel tubes, air and energy waning quickly on the bottom of the swimming pool.\nPasses and strategies played out. Sticks tapped the tile around the puck in miniature sword fights to gain possession. To distinguish who was who, one team wielded white sticks, and the other black.\n''Did you see that move?'' Ms. Nielsen exclaimed, surfacing to talk to her teammates. The opposing team -- the White Sticks -- had tapped in a goal, twisting past Ms. Nielsen and three other swimmers in an offensive dash.\nTeams collect between each goal (4-3 is a typical final score for a tournament game), resting, breathing and concocting strategy. ''Our forwards are getting too far away from our backs,'' said Chris Tommaso, a 26-year-old chemical engineer. ''Let's keep to the positions.''\nThen at the signal -- ''Sticks up, go!'' -- both sides dived back in, swimming the front crawl to the center of the pool before heading down.\n''Let the feeding frenzy begin,'' said a player resting on the pool's edge.\nUnderwater, the athletes swam and spun in the deep fuzzy blue. Arms stretched for the puck.\nEight feet down, water pressure pushed in on ears and eyes. Players kicked hard, swimming off into the deep, twirling in the fizz of their own alternate universe.\nBELOW THE SURFACE\nTHE sport of underwater hockey has a worldwide following of several thousand participants, including teams in Slovenia, Brazil, Japan, Zimbabwe and 28 other countries.\n''The sport provides an outlet for former competitive swimmers and divers,'' said Gregory Appling, a director with the Underwater Society of America.\nTeams like the Minnesota Loons, a 25-member club in Minneapolis (www.mnuwh.com), practice once or twice a week all year and travel to tournaments around the country.\nAbout 50 underwater hockey clubs exist in the United States, with teams from Hawaii to New York. Newcomers are welcome at most clubs, Mr. Appling said.\nA list of underwater hockey clubs is at www.pucku.org/uwht.\nADVENTURER
1816470	So Many Different People to Be, Onstage and Off, if She Can Dodge the Trucks	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902EEDF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Iris Bahr's résumé reads as if it were pasted together from the résumés of a bunch of people who have never met.\nAt one point she's working for Israeli intelligence; then she's the author of a memoir about, among other things, her attempts to lose her virginity. Here she is playing opposite Larry David on television; here she is playing opposite Larry the Cable Guy in a movie. Oh, and here is Ms. Bahr studying neuropsychology at Brown University.\nAlong with all this Ms. Bahr, who is in her early 30s, has written a one-woman, 11-character show, ''Dai (Enough),'' which is now playing at the Culture Project's new headquarters at 55 Mercer Street in SoHo. (It opened in November to good reviews at the Culture Project's former headquarters on Bleecker Street.)\n''Dai'' takes place at a cafe in Tel Aviv. The characters, all of whom are introduced minutes before they become casualties of a suicide bombing, include a young American in the Israeli army, a snooty Israeli expatriate who lives in Manhattan, a Palestinian professor, an American actress and a militant West Bank settler.\nIt is practically a law that anyone who has written a solo show with several distinctive characters must say, in some variation, ''The characters are really different aspects of my own life.'' Over a large bowl of hummus at a nondescript Israeli restaurant on the Lower East Side, Ms. Bahr mercifully said nothing of the kind. But with a background like hers, she certainly had claim to.\nWhere do you even start? One day you're performing brain scans in a lab at a top school; a few years later you're sitting on a ski lift with Mr. David in an episode of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm.'' What's the career arc there?\n''I was in Israel for a year, my junior year,'' said Ms. Bahr, who speaks in a rat-a-tat-tat and can go from serious to sarcastic to self-deprecating to serious in four sentences flat. ''I was doing cancer research with rats, psycho-biology stuff. And I didn't do any acting there, and I realized there was a void. When I came back to Brown, I did much more acting. And then I moved to New York. And then I got hit by a truck.''\nA truck.\n''Yeah, I was on my way back from clown class.''\nAnd bam, you're back where you started, which is to say, you have even more little puzzle pieces that don't seem to go together.\nMuch about Ms. Bahr can be learned in her gracefully titled memoir, ''Dork Whore: My Travels Through Asia as a Twenty-Year-Old Pseudo-Virgin'' (Bloomsbury). The subtitle cannot be fully explained here, nor can her unpleasant experience in the audience at a Bangkok sex show, nor her exquisitely detailed gastrointestinal troubles, nor her repeated attempts to bring to an end her pseudo-virginal status.\nBut there is plenty else about her in the book, which is due out in March. She grew up in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, going to an Orthodox school but living in a secular household with her Israeli parents. After her parents divorced (the book mentions a mistress, an unpleasant break-up), Ms. Bahr, then 13, moved with her mother to Israel.\nAfter serving two years in the army (intelligence, she says; ''can't really talk about it''), Ms. Bahr took the trip that would become the memoir. And after that, Brown, for the brain science.\n''I've always been fascinated by human psychology,'' she said. ''I like the emotional manifestation of people, people's behaviors, but I also love the organic roots of that behavior, which part of the brain does this and that.''\nActing, though, was her preferred science, so after school she moved to New York and enrolled in the Actors Center Conservatory (which includes a class on clowning). That aforementioned truck, one of those big, green city Parks Department numbers, was taking a left onto Great Jones Street when it knocked Ms. Bahr off her bicycle, into the hospital and, after some soul-searching, out to Los Angeles, where her acting and comedy career took off.\nAnd now there's ''Dai,'' which is quite funny in parts but not the kind of thing you'd expect from the author of her book.\n''I was surprised,'' said Allan Buchman, the artistic director of the Culture Project, who said he was expecting something from Ms. Bahr that showcased her quick wit and keen sense of humor.\n''Dai,'' which Ms. Bahr said was never intended to be a polemic, is nonetheless about an inherently political -- and serious -- topic.\nMr. Buchman said he knew of a Palestinian acquaintance who walked out after simply reading Ms. Bahr's program notes. But, he added: ''I do think there's enough in this play that intelligent people can have a conversation about it without feeling that we're waving the Israeli flag. I think it is really a product of her trying to comes to terms with some of the questions that her life has posed.''\nMs. Bahr's own views of the conflict, she said, are mixed, though her perspective is obviously an Israeli one.\n''No one's going to come in and say, 'Oh my God, that's such an elaborate concept on peace in the Middle East,' '' she said. ''I had a specific desire to make it a very visceral emotional experience.''\nHer memories of the precarious day-to-day existence that she wrote about go back to the first gulf war, when air-raid sirens forced her to stay inside and play Monopoly for hours. It's not the only part of her life in Israel that stamped her; when she talks about the uncertainty of fitting in, as an American in Israel, it goes a long way toward explaining those seemingly incongruous multitudes -- scientist and artist, secular and Orthodox -- that somehow add up to her biography.\n''I'd study really hard, but then I'd hitch rides with complete strangers and go to this little place called the Penguin in Tel Aviv and listen to punk rock,'' she said, describing her high school experience. ''I think I'm a contradiction in a lot of ways.''\n''Dai (Enough)'' is at the Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983.
1816471	Inside Art	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEEDF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	A Pair of New Owners For an Old President\nThe New York collectors Judy and Michael Steinhardt have bought a full-length portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart that failed to sell in an auction at Sotheby's on behalf of the New York Public Library in November 2004.\nThe painting, the first of four identical full-length paintings by Stuart, shows Washington standing with his right hand on a table and his left hand holding a sword. It is nearly nine feet tall.\n''It's a great American icon,'' said Richard L. Feigen, the Manhattan dealer. ''It was unfortunate that it ever went to auction, because it's too big for a private home.''\nMr. Feigen is so enamored of the painting that he suggested that the Steinhardts buy it, even though their world-class collection is predominantly antiquities and modern art. He said they agreed ''to help out the library,'' with a view, perhaps, to giving the Stuart to an American museum.\nDating from around 1800, the portrait is known as the Munro-Lenox Portrait, after two of its 19th-century owners: Peter Jay Munro, a lawyer and a nephew of John Jay, and James Lenox, the New York bibliophile and philanthropist.\nThe painting is on view at the Grand Palais in Paris as part of the exhibition ''Citizens and Kings: Portraits in the Age of Revolution, 1760-1830,'' which moves to the Royal Academy in London in February and then to an American institution yet to be determined.\n''Since it's tied up for the next 10 months, the Steinhardts have plenty of time to decide where it will go,'' Mr. Feigen said. ''They haven't made any commitments. They may put it on extended loan somewhere.''\nNeither he nor library officials would say how much the Steinhardts had paid. Sotheby's had estimated the portrait at $6 million to $8 million. The officials would say only that it sold for above its reserve, the secret minimum price agreed upon by the library and Sotheby's, which experts say was around $5 million.\nThe Stuart is the last of a major group of paintings the library has sold to build its endowment.\n''We've now raised $52.8 million,'' said Paul LeClerc, president of the library. At Sotheby's it sold 16 works, including a Stuart portrait of Washington seated, for $8.1 million. In May 2005 it sold its star painting -- ''Kindred Spirits,'' an 1849 Hudson River School landscape by Asher B. Durand -- to the Wal-Mart heiress Alice L. Walton in a sealed-bid auction for about $35 million.\nMr. LeClerc said the Stuart was the end of a major selling initiative for the library. But, he added, a dozen or so smaller works in storage may go to auction this year.\nA Gift to the Hammer\nDean Valentine, a Los Angeles-based television executive, and his wife, Amy Adelson, a television producer, have given the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles 42 contemporary artworks by 24 artists, most from the Los Angeles area. The gift, worth more than $1 million, consists primarily of sculpture and multimedia pieces. It will help to form the core of the Hammer's new contemporary-art collection.\n''We see ourselves as an artist-centered museum,'' said Gary Garrels, the Hammer's chief curator and deputy director for exhibitions, who emphasized that he wanted local artists well represented in its collections.\n''Los Angeles is one of the primary creative centers,'' he added. ''And we're ringside.''\nThe gift includes works by many artists who have recently emerged from the master of fine arts program at the University of California, Los Angeles, among them Xavier Cha, Liz Craft, Hannah Greely, Pentti Monkkonen and Paul Sietsema.\nPublic Performance Art\nThe nonprofit Public Art Fund may be best known for organizing outdoor projects in places like Rockefeller Center or the Doris C. Freedman Plaza on Fifth Avenue and 60th Street, but it is becoming more involved in performance. On March 30 it will present ''Martin Creed's Variety Show,'' part music, theater, talk and dance.\nMr. Creed, the British artist who won the prestigious Turner Prize in 2001, has been juggling conceptual art with his love of music. He is a songwriter and plays guitar in a band. The show will be at the Abrons Arts Center on the Lower East Side. Tickets may be purchased at the door or on the Public Art Fund Web site, www.publicartfund.org.\nThat's not to say that the Public Art Fund has abandoned its efforts to show the work of younger artists. For the 12th year, as part of its program ''In the Public Realm,'' it has announced an open call to emerging artists living in New York State who want to create temporary works in a public space. Artists are asked to submit slides or other documentation of recent work and a statement of interest by Feb. 9. Arts professionals will select about 10 artists to develop formal proposals, toward which they will receive $1,000. The committee will then select three to do projects for 2008.\nAcquisitions in Detroit\nAs a result of examining its collections with an eye to a major reinstallation after its $158 million expansion and renovation is completed next year, the Detroit Institute of Arts has acquired more than 900 works. They range from an 1893 Whistler seascape to a 16th-century Turkish charger and a 17th-century royal Nigerian ivory arm bracelet.\nGraham W. J. Beal, the museum's director, said several new curators were responsible for rethinking its collections. Kenneth Myers, who became the museum's curator of American art in 2005, found the Whistler, ''Violet and Blue: Among the Rollers,'' while flipping through a catalog for Cottone's Auctions in Mount Morris, N.Y. The museum bought it for $1 million.\nInside Art
1816472	No Matter Its Name, an Ensemble Finds Its Niche	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDF1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	As jazz ensembles go, a Hammond B-3 organ trio heeds rather strict protocols. It usually consists of organ, guitar and drums; the organist doubles as a bassist, using foot pedals and a walking left hand. The blues are its lingua franca, even when bebop or modal vamping is involved. And within a certain range of tempo -- anywhere between a stroll and a jaunt -- its imperative is a hard, foot-tapping swing.\nTwo of the best organ trios of the last decade have featured the same three players. Technically speaking, it's just one group, variously billed as the Larry Goldings Trio (on several albums) or the Peter Bernstein Trio (on a recent DVD). Consisting of Mr. Goldings on organ, Mr. Bernstein on guitar and Bill Stewart on drums, it fulfills all of the standard criteria capably and rewardingly, without trying to reinvent the wheel.\nFor their engagement at the Village Vanguard this week the musicians are companionably listed in alphabetical order. During the first set on Wednesday night, though, Mr. Bernstein clearly held the reins. Most of the tunes were his, and he took the melodic lead throughout. The presence of two serious guitarists in the house, the august Jim Hall and the virtuosic Russell Malone, further implied that he was the man to watch.\nAnd he was, from the start of an easygoing original called ''Simple as That.'' Phrasing unhurriedly, Mr. Bernstein let each of his notes ring out. His tone was crisp yet rounded, with a slight citrus tang. And while his style suggested a guitarist's guitarist -- not a horn player or singer in disguise -- he seemed to be filtering out many of the stock patterns that fall most easily on the fretboard. He was thoughtful, rather than artful, in his hesitations.\nMr. Bernstein had a concrete foundation in his rhythm section, both in the sense of something solid and in the manner of something being churned. Mr. Goldings and Mr. Stewart have a rapport rooted in contrast: the warm, washy hum of the organ versus the tight chatter of a ride cymbal, high-hat and snare drum. They worked together most impressively on an original by Mr. Goldings called ''The Acrobat,'' set in a polyrhythmic waltz time; even when the groove shifted into a walking swing, the tension stayed high.\nA similar cohesive drive propelled Mr. Bernstein's ''Jive Coffee,'' which is based on the chord progression of ''Tea for Two,'' but in a floating 5/4 meter. By contrast, a light-funk number called ''Dragonfly'' felt static, not only because of its harmonic drone but also the extent to which it dampened the expressive dynamics of the band.\nOn ''Pannonica,'' a signature ballad by Thelonious Monk, Mr. Bernstein ventured an unaccompanied introduction with minimal amplification, producing a respectful but quietly inventive melodic statement. When Mr. Goldings entered, his chords seemed to rumble and swell into being. It wasn't a particularly Monk-like approach, but it was true to the setting, and worked beautifully.\nPeter Bernstein, Larry Goldings and Bill Stewart perform through Sunday at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village; villagevanguard.com, (212) 255-4037.\nMUSIC REVIEW
1816473	Once Upon a Time, Flopsy and Mopsy, There Was a Plucky Proto-Feminist Who	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E5DE1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	In ''Miss Potter,'' Renée Zellweger, her face pickled in cheeriness, is Beatrix Potter, the creator of Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin and Mrs. Tittlemouse, among other beloved characters in children's literature.\nThis British author and illustrator, as portrayed by Ms. Zellweger, is almost as chipper as Julie Andrews's Mary Poppins, but twice as affected and not half as English-sounding. If Ms. Zellweger's shaky English accent carried her through two Bridget Jones movies, portraying an upper-middle-class Victorian woman presents a steeper elocutionary challenge. Her enunciation in ''Miss Potter'' lacks the starchy refinement demanded by the role. As she scrunches her face into polite grimaces and trills her phrases, you have the sense of an actor straining not to exhaust a limited repertory of genteel English mannerisms.\nIn Richard Maltby Jr.'s worshipful screenplay, Potter emerges as a plucky heroine for all seasons: a proto-feminist, a proto-environmentalist and a perfect lady. And from the beginning, this innocuous, fiercely Anglophilic trifle of a movie is too nice for its own good. There was plenty of drama in Potter's life, but the film turns major conflicts and losses into minor setbacks in a charmed, entirely virtuous existence. Even a sudden personal tragedy doesn't devastate this indefatigable font of resilience.\n''Miss Potter'' is easy on the eyes. The first movie directed by the Australian filmmaker Chris Noonan since his sleeper hit, ''Babe,'' 11 years ago, it has the same pastel storybook palette and the same overriding mood of gentleness. Scenes filmed in the English Lake District, where Potter vacationed with her family and studied the local fauna, unfold like heavily captioned pages in a travel brochure.\nAny hint of whimsy is welcome. And in the picture's most endearing moments, the author's characters stir to animated life on the page as she communes with them. These touches, of which there are too few, suggest a woman who is much more complicated (and eccentric) than ''Miss Potter'' lets on. They also evoke the intensity of the creative process through which Potter invented her classic characters out of childhood pets and closely observed wildlife.\nThe movie concentrates on only a few years in the life of Potter, who was born in 1866 and privately published her first book, ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit,'' in 1901. It proved so popular that she took it back to a publisher who had originally rejected it; he reconsidered once she agreed to reillustrate it in color. Published in 1902, it was an enormous hit, and the money she earned from it and its successors brought her independence from her strait-laced, nouveau-riche Victorian family.\nThe closest thing to a villain in the movie is Potter's snobbish, social-climbing mother, Helen (Barbara Flynn), a stout, severe matriarch who refuses to recognize her daughter's accomplishments even after she earns fame and fortune for her work. Determined that Beatrix marry wealth, she pressures her to choose a husband from a series of suitors, each more grotesque than the one before. Beatrix will have none of it. Her father, Rupert (Bill Paterson), though more sympathetic, kowtows to the will of the fearsome Helen.\nBecause her publishers, the brothers Harold and Fruing Warne, have low expectations for ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' -- they dismissively refer to it as her ''bunny book'' -- they hand the project to their younger sibling, Norman (Ewan McGregor). The role of a buttoned-up Victorian editor is a complete turnabout from Mr. McGregor's usual rakes, but he inhabits it comfortably. Even after Beatrix and Norman become engaged (over her parents' objections), they continue to address each other as Miss Potter and Mr. Warne.\nPotter forms a tight friendship with Warne's unmarried sister, Millie (Emily Watson, emitting mischievous sparks), and their sisterhood -- they agree that there's more to a woman's life than marriage and children -- gives the story its feminist credentials.\nOnce Potter achieves financial independence, the movie dawdles on pleasantly as she buys Hill Top, a farm in the Lake District, in 1905, and goes on to become a major landowner in the region in a campaign to preserve the area from developers; again, conflicts are minimized.\nShe later finds romance with a lawyer, William Heelis (Lloyd Owen), whom she would marry in 1913. Potter, who died in 1943, lived way beyond the time frame of the movie. At her death, she left 14 farms and 4,000 acres of land to the National Trust, along with her flocks of Herdwick sheep.\nThis much sweetness and light in a movie is all very well. But there's a reason that recipes for cake and cookies call for a pinch of salt. In ''Miss Potter,'' there is only a grain or two -- not enough to dilute the sugary overload. The film is the cinematic equivalent of a delicate English tea cake whose substance is buried under too many layers of icing.\n''Miss Potter'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for brief mild language.\nMiss Potter Opens today in New York and Los Angeles.\nDirected by Chris Noonan; written by Richard Maltby Jr.; director of photography, Andrew Dunn; edited by Robin Sales; production designer, Martin Childs; produced by Mike Medavoy, David Kirschner, Corey Sienega, Arnold Messer and David Thwaites; released by Metro Goldwyn Mayer and the Weinstein Company. Running time: 92 minutes.\nWITH: Renée Zellweger (Beatrix Potter), Ewan McGregor (Norman Warne), Emily Watson (Millie Warne), Barbara Flynn (Mrs. Potter), Bill Paterson (Rupert Potter), Matyelok Gibbs (Miss Wiggin), Lloyd Owen (William Heelis), Anton Lesser (Harold Warne) and David Bamber (Fruing Warne).\nFILM REVIEW
1816474	A Forest, a Prince and a Slumbering Lass, at a Gallop	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DE1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Much was made of the fast pace and streamlined look of Peter Martins's restaging of ''The Sleeping Beauty'' for the New York City Ballet at its premiere in 1991. The ballet, which opened the company's winter repertory season on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater, has been condensed to a mere two acts from a leisurely, sumptuous three.\nMr. Martins honors the supposedly ''neo-classical'' traditions set by the company that George Balanchine founded, with Lincoln Kirstein, in America. And some saw, in the coronation that ends the new production, a metaphor for Kirstein's handing over of the company to Mr. Martins after Balanchine's death. But the production also honors Balanchine's reverence for the traditions of the ballet training of his youth in St. Petersburg, including Marius Petipa's ''Sleeping Beauty,'' and incorporates Balanchine's delicately spectacular 1981 Garland Dance.\nKirstein, who died in 1996 and whose centenary will be celebrated this year, had a special love for ''The Sleeping Beauty.'' Reportedly he envisioned a tangle of skulls and bits of human bones and flesh caught in the overgrowth through which the Lilac Fairy guides Prince Désiré to find the sleeping Aurora. The Prince was probably not the first mortal, after all, to try to breach those impenetrable green battlements.\nA thighbone or two would be welcome in Mr. Martins's production, which has jettisoned or streamlined to near invisibility some important elements in the magical fairy-tale narrative at the heart of this classic. The Prince now zips through the forest with ease and kisses Aurora awake so quickly that this central image passes by almost unnoticed.\nA few moments of hyperkinetic mime on Wednesday suggest that Mr. Martins's decision largely to forgo dramatic narrative may have been a wise one. But the crucial Vision Scene, in which the Prince seeks out his heart's desire in a phantom Aurora, is now a fast-passing blur. A great pity, because that theme of unfulfilled yearning helps give the 19th-century classic story ballets their generation-spanning relevance.\nWendy Whelan, dancing Aurora rather jaggedly, came closest here to the kind of poetry that the work demands, though the staging did not give her a chance for eloquence. Nikolaj Hubbe's Prince did add a touch of warmth and passion.\nOn the other hand Mr. Martins has blessedly streamlined the tedious hunting-party scene. He has showcased male dancing, and the six first-act Fairy Cavaliers were terrific, as were Stephen Hanna's buoyant, extra-elegant ''Gold'' in the ''Jewels'' divertissement and Henry Seth's swashbuckling Wolf. Andrew Veyette was a muscular new Bluebird that soared high, in part because of his clear foot beats.\nMerrill Ashley, this production's original Carabosse, returned in majestically seething form, though the character now has too little to do. The new and the old came together most impressively in Teresa Reichlen's ''Diamond,'' a stylish and imaginatively danced role debut; in Jennie Somogyi's expansive, gracious Lilac Fairy; and in Amanda Hankes's daring Fairy of Tenderness, also a role debut. This crop of Fairy attendants at Aurora's birth -- which also included Ana Sophia Scheller, just promoted to soloist (new as the Fairy of Vivacity), Rebecca Krohn (new as Generosity), Alina Dronova (Eloquence) and the superb Ellen Bar (Courage) -- lived up to the challenge Mr. Martins gives the fairies to luxuriate more traditionally in the choreography, especially the port de bras.\nThe lead cast was completed by Tiler Peck, also a newly promoted soloist and new in ''Emerald,'' Abi Stafford (''Ruby'') and Megan Fairchild (Princess Florine). Maurice Kaplow conducted the Tchaikovsky score.\nThe New York City Ballet performs ''The Sleeping Beauty'' through Jan. 14 at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or nycballet.com.\nDANCE REVIEW
1816475	Defending the Printed Page as the New China Stirred	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE5DE1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	China's growing prosperity and the soaring prices for contemporary Chinese art make it easy to forget that the country first opened its doors to modernization in the late 1970s, when Mao's successor Deng Xiaoping introduced capitalist-oriented market reforms. Deng also removed restrictions on the flow of information in China, which allowed foreign ideas to flourish. Most of this information arrived not via the Internet, of course, but in the form of books.\n''Shu: Reinventing Books in Chinese Contemporary Art,'' now at the China Institute, glances back at this period of expansion and its contraction, when the Communist Party clamped down on free expression after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The exhibition, divided into two parts (the first ran this fall), doesn't break new art historical ground, but it does provide a savvy snapshot of the early-1990s Chinese contemporary-art scene.\n''Shu,'' meaning book in Chinese, was organized by Wu Hung, an art history professor at the University of Chicago. Dr. Wu specializes in Tang dynasty painting, but his true passion lies with contemporary Chinese art. Unsurprisingly, ''Shu'' focuses on how current Chinese artists bridge the gap between China's literati past and its increasingly capitalist present.\nIn ''Reimagining Tradition,'' the first installment of ''Shu,'' in the fall, artists put new spins on China's centuries-old artistic traditions. Gu Wenda, for example, displayed modernized versions of scholar's accouterments, including ink made from Mr. Gu's signature material: real Chinese human hair. Xu Bing exhibited the wood blocks he used to print ''Book From the Sky,'' a series of 50-foot-long scrolls first shown in 1988 in Beijing. The calligraphy looks authentic, but can't be read. Mr. Xu made up every single one of its 4,000 characters.\nWhile Mr. Xu's text literally says nothing, it does intimate how hard it was to be an artist in a country that was out of the habit of valuing intellectuals. Now, the second part of ''Shu,'' ''Negotiating History and Memory,'' portrays the anxiety of artists under pressure during the early years of China's emergence.\nLife in China during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), with its public denunciations, forced labor and death by mob violence, was traumatic. But for many Chinese, including the artist Gu Xiong, it was also a time when China was sure of its cultural self.\nAt 16, Mr. Gu was sent to the countryside for re-education. When he wasn't working in tobacco fields, he created an illustrated diary, on exhibit here under the title ''Cultural Revolution Sketchbooks'' (1972-76). His drawings, all stylistically similar to Cultural Revolution propaganda posters, show no sign of a disgruntled teenager. Instead, they quietly celebrate revolutionary life among comrades.\nChinese cultural life changed dramatically in the 1980s, when literature other than Mao's ''Little Red Book'' surfaced. Qiu Zhijie's photographic ''library,'' which papers the walls of the China Institute's main staircase, makes the extent of this information explosion evident. Among the thousands of titles are Chinese classics, books on natural sciences and treatises by Plato, Disraeli and Harold Bloom, as well as art books on Indian stupa, Japanese manga and Barbara Kruger.\nSuch a trove might have been considered a treasure before the Tiananmen Square protests; afterward, such resources became sources of angst. The figure that appears throughout Zhang Xiaogang's 1991 series ''Private Notes,'' for example, looks as if he is losing his mind -- and his head, torso and myriad other body parts -- as he struggles to write letters and decode illegible manuscripts. Without easy access to words, the images imply, there can be no such thing as free expression.\nIn the early 1990s the average Chinese citizen wouldn't have had time to bother with such intellectual problems, as Xiaoze Xie's photorealist painting depicting worm-eaten books left to rot on library shelves suggests.\nYue Minjun's ''Garbage Dump'' (2005-6) highlights how a lack of appreciation for things scholarly caused tension between the educated and the uneducated. Here books are the subject of a bizarre, cavemanlike ritual, as six semi-naked men squat together in a circle on top of piles of books, grinning like village idiots.\n''Garbage Dump'' implies that narrow minds, not books, make people stupid. Cai Guo Qiang's contribution, an ink-painted miniature screen that is actually a proposal for a museum project, suggests that fear also creates thought imprisonment, and not only in China.\nIn 1995, when the Naoshima Museum in Japan commissioned Mr. Cai to create a project, he proposed ''Wako: Japanese Pirates in the Middle Ages.'' His idea involved taking a boat from China to Japan via Taiwan and Korea. When the boat stopped, it would take on board a stone stele carved with that region's dictionary definition of wako. These pirates historically disrupted trade along the ancient silk routes; everyone who came into contact with them (except the Japanese, of course) hated them. Afraid that the project might incite antagonism toward Japan, the museum canceled the show.\nToday it is unlikely that Mr. Cai's project would be censored. China has metamorphosed from an isolated, intellectual desert into fertile ground for cultural exchange. It is in this soil, not in the post-Tiananmen world of the early 1990s, where the future of Chinese contemporary art lies. China, after all, now more than ever, is a superpower.\n''Shu'' continues through Feb. 24 at the China Institute, 125 East 65th Street, Manhattan; (212) 744-8181 or chinainstitute.org.\nART REVIEW
1816476	Self-Portraits That Obscure the Self	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E4DE1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Photographers and painters have always made self-portraits; doing your own likeness is part of an artist's franchise. But sometimes the camera's potential nudges photographers further, encouraging a theatrical impulse: to portray themselves as a clown, or a person of the opposite sex, or even, say, Jesus. That was the case with F. Holland Day (1864-1933), a wealthy and eccentric Bostonian influenced by artists like Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley. Starting out as a publisher of belles lettres, in the late 1880s he began making photographs, and rather exotic ones, at that.\nProbably his best-known work is an 1898 series of more than 250 photographs portraying the Passion of Christ, in which he posed as Jesus, training for the role by losing weight and letting his hair and beard grow. What is usually shown from this series is the group known as ''The Seven Last Words of Christ,'' seven portraits that refer to Jesus' statements from the time of his crucifixion until his death. In each photograph Mr. Day, in character, assumed what he felt were facial expressions consonant with Jesus' ordeal.\nMr. Day's work, more or less sidelined by Modernist photography, nevertheless reverberated into the 1960s, when artists began to pick up on the notion he and other early photographers had of seeing themselves in unaccustomed aspects, perhaps as historical or fantastical personages or in other manifestations rising above the usual tightly controlled portrait shot. Now, in ''Photography and the Self: The Legacy of F. Holland Day,'' a small show organized by Carrie Springer, a senior curatorial assistant, the Whitney Museum of American Art has juxtaposed ''The Seven Last Words of Christ'' with less exalted photographs from its own collection by 14 more recent practitioners who present themselves in all manner of guises.\nArguably the best-known serial self-imagist of our times is Cindy Sherman, who has portrayed herself in hundreds of elaborately constructed semblances, from a modest housewife to the elegant subject of portraits by Rembrandt and Ingres. Here she appears in a more commonplace role, the sexless clown (''Untitled,'' 2004) whose morose stare contrasts sharply with the flamboyance of her getup. Others who cross the gender gap include Robert Mapplethorpe, dressed as a cool, befurred floozie in ''Self-Portrait'' (1980); and Lyle Ashton Harris, who in ''Billie #21'' (2002) sees himself as his idol Billie Holiday with fur wrap and pearl necklace, mouth wide open in mid-song.\nFor some of the artists in the show, self-identity has strong political overtones. Gender inequality was a serious matter for the feminist performer Hannah Wilke (1940-1993), who in a photograph of her face from her ''S.O.S. Scarification Object Series'' (1974) sardonically calls attention to her femalehood by wearing her hair in curlers and plastering her face with small, vulva-shaped patches of chewing gum.\nAnti-homosexual sentiment is flouted by Robert Gober, who for his ''Untitled'' (1992-96) has concocted a dummy page from The New York Times, inserting himself into a bridal-gown advertisement positioned under an article headlined ''Vatican Condones Discrimination Against Homosexuals.''\nThe dilemma of being black in a white society is separately enacted by Adrian Piper and Carrie Mae Weems. In ''Food for the Spirit'' (1971), a series of 14 photographs that seem to grow progressively blacker, Ms. Piper can be dimly perceived, sometimes nude and facing frontally, a camera at the ready as if to snap a picture of the viewer. Her own image is finally lost in darkness. Ms. Weems's ''Portrait of Myself as an Intellectual Revolutionary'' (1988) shows her staring defiantly at the viewer, hands folded under chin, elbows resting on a barren desk, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with a hammer-and-sickle logo. Behind her hang portraits of a Russian woman worker holding a gun, Marx and other political figures.\nLucas Samaras and Francesca Woodman project otherworldly, rather than political, identities. In ''Skull and Milky Way'' (1966) Mr. Samaras places an X-ray of his skull against the vast, glittering background of the galaxy. And in a slightly more intimate interplay with closer surroundings, Ms. Woodman (1958-81), her crouching nude body camouflaged by a piece of torn wallpaper, puts her hands yearningly against a wall as if she would be part of it (1976).\nEven though this show is small, it is more inclusive than it ought to be. Surely the performance of a so-called body artist like Chris Burden, who in an early piece from 1971 presents himself as a man of invincible strength, strapped to the floor with copper bands while live wires come dangerously near him, has less interest as psychic exploration than as a physical feat. And the same goes for Charles Ray, another California provocateur who in 1973 attached his body to a tree branch for more than half a day to be mulled by puzzled passers-by.\nNor is it easy to catch a clue to the inner persona of Nan Goldin in ''Nan and Brian in Bed'' (1983). The show's concept is a good one, and there are wonderful things here, but a certain confusion of focus and its limitation to the Whitney's own collection seem to handicap better development of the theme.\n''Photography and the Self: The Legacy of F. Holland Day'' continues through March 11 at the Whitney Museum of American Art, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org.\nPHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW
1816477	Counterculture Lion, Back in His Tidy Jungle	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E4DE1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	''I SUPPOSE the '60s seemed like a big revolution, but to me it always felt a small circle of friends,'' Robert Stone said recently while revisiting his old East Village neighborhood, one of that era's epicenters. ''And by the time of the Summer of Love, in the late '60s, it was over. That was the end of it. Every kid who was on the loose turned up, and it was no longer our thing. It was a fashion.''\nMr. Stone, who is himself an emblematic '60s figure -- perhaps the only member of Ken Kesey's famed Merry Prankster bus trip of 1964 who can still remember what happened -- is 69 now, and he and Janice, his wife of 47 years, recently decided to take a break. No drink or drugs for at least a year, after which, Mr. Stone said, they will ''rethink.'' One bonus of the new regimen, he added, is that he now gets more work done in the evening.\nThe author of seven novels, including ''Dog Soldiers,'' ''A Flag for Sunrise'' and ''Damascus Gate,'' Mr. Stone has at last finished a long-awaited memoir of the '60s, ''Prime Green,'' which comes out Tuesday. It recounts his history not only with Kesey but with such other counterculture legends as Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady and Allen Ginsberg; with the pioneering ''acid tests'' in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco (Mr. Stone's first hit was administered by Baba Ram Dass himself); his apprenticeship at a cheesy tabloid where he wrote headlines like ''Mad Dentist Yanks Girl's Tongue,'' and, later, his stints as a war correspondent in Vietnam.\nBut as the book makes clear, Mr. Stone's '60s were in large part an outgrowth of the Beat culture of the 1950s, and Mr. Stone, who grew up in S.R.O. hotels on the West Side and now lives on the Upper East Side, recently spent a couple of hours wandering around the East Village, where he lived and hung out in those days. For a while he even had a paper route there. ''It was almost a different country back then: you couldn't understand people from other parts, and they couldn't understand you,'' he said in a voice that still has echoes of an old-fashioned streetwise New York accent. ''The culture wasn't so homogeneous. When I was in the service in the '50s, I remember, they served pizza once, and some of the guys put ice cream on it because they thought it was pie.''\nFirst stop: 13 St. Marks Place. ''That's where we were on New Year's Eve, 1959,'' Mr. Stone said, pointing to an upstairs apartment. ''My wife and I and our first child. Of course the neighborhood wasn't fixed up then: it was really an extension of the Bowery. When my wife or I used to go shopping, we used to have a choice about what to bring upstairs first, the groceries or the kid. I always figured there was more chance of the food being stolen, so I'd give some derelict a dime and ask him to watch the baby.''\nAcross the street he pointed out a brownstone building with a carved sign indicating that it was the Deutsche-Amerikanische Schützen Gesellschaft, or German-American Shooting School: a relic, he said, of the days when the neighborhood was a German one. ''It was the General Slocum disaster that pretty much ended that,'' he said, referring to a 1904 steamship explosion in the East River that left more than 1,000 dead, many of them residents of the old German-American neighborhood that became the East Village.\nMr. Stone paused for a minute, looking around, and said: ''You know, the biggest change is that all these buildings have been cleaned. It all looks so different. When I lived here, everything was a plain, somber gray. In winter especially, I really liked the grayness, the severity, of it all. The grimness.''\nOther landmarks on the block include W. H. Auden's building, farther along, at No. 77 St. Marks Place, and closer to the middle of the block the site of the Polski Dom, or Polish Home, a favorite spot for Gypsy weddings, which Andy Warhol turned into the Electric Circus nightclub of the late '60s.\n''I never really got the Warhol thing,'' Mr. Stone said. ''Back then the concept of bohemia wasn't a mass phenomenon. We still thought of it as kind of a coterie thing, and we were a little snobbish. When we started doing the drugs -- peyote and smoking dope -- it was part of the Beat scene. Dope wasn't being done everywhere, and we felt kind of proprietary about it. And when it started spreading in the '60s, it was like going to a party and having it spill out the door.''\nAround the corner, on East Fourth Street, was an earlier apartment of the Stones, in a building called the Garden of Eden. But the sign is gone now, and Mr. Stone was no longer sure where the entrance was.\n''I used to think of this as kind of an elegant block,'' he said. ''But it doesn't look that way now.'' He pointed to a little playground across the street.\n''That's where the Jets used to hang out,'' he said. ''They didn't call themselves that, but that's what they were, a gang.'' He smiled and added that while growing up in New York he had briefly been a junior member of a gang called the Saxons. ''But we didn't have guns,'' he said. ''We had rock fights in Central Park.''\nIn the course of the afternoon a lot of bars and clubs were invoked, a litany of classic New York watering holes: Bradley's, the Cedar Tavern, the Lion's Head, McSorley's Old Ale House (where, Mr. Stone recalled, they used to lock the door on New Year's Eve and let the remaining customers finish off the kegs free), the 55 (for a while a druggies' haunt, where Janice Stone once saw three men overdose on methadone) and the Figaro, at Bleecker and Macdougal Streets, where Robert and Janice Stone first met.\n''Every young woman in black stockings worked at the Figaro back then,'' he said. ''During the day Janice worked as a guidette at the RCA Building, so in the evening she'd have to take off her uniform and then put on the other uniform -- the black stockings.''\nThere was also a bar on East Sixth Street where Mr. Stone used to buy peyote buttons imported from a cactus ranch in Texas. ''It was a place run by a guy named the Baron,'' he said. ''He was a follower of Ayn Rand, so the only sign out front was a big dollar sign.''\nMr. Stone recalled that he would sometimes stop off at the Baron's on his way to The Daily News, where he worked for a while, writing sports captions and occasionally covering professional wrestling. And he added, though it probably goes without saying, ''The wrestling matches were pretty weird on peyote.''\nHeading toward Astor Place, he discovered that one of his favorite coffee shops had been turned into a Starbucks. Stopping for a light, he said, with less sadness than surprise: ''I used to have such a tremendous sense of the city and of this neighborhood, and it's lost to me now. It's so far away I can't even miss it. So many places I attached myself to, and I can't even feel it anymore. It's beyond nostalgia, beyond reclaim.''\nRobert Stone's Village\nCorrection: January 11, 2007, Thursday Because of an editing error, an article in Weekend on Friday about a walk in the East Village with Robert Stone, who has a new memoir about the 1960s, ''Prime Green,'' misstated the history of Andy Warhol's connection with the Polski Dom, or Polish Home, on St. Marks Place. The nightclub Warhol opened there, in 1966, was called Dom, not the Electric Circus. (The Electric Circus, not run by Warhol, opened at the site in 1967.)\nA map with the article omitted identification of one street and misidentified two others. The unidentified street north of St. Marks Place is East Ninth Street; the two streets north of that are East 10th and East 11th -- not East Ninth and East 10th.\nThe map also included an imprecise translation of the German name Deutsche-Amerikanische Schützen Gesellschaft, engraved on the building at 12 St. Marks Place, built in 1885. The ''German-American Shooting Club'' is a more precise translation and description of the organization's function in the community than ''German-American Shooting School.''
1816478	With Ed, All's Green On the Domestic Front	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E4DE1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Allow me to begin with a confession: I had no idea that Ed Begley Jr., an actor whose near constant presence on television doesn't swing his curriculum vitae easily into recollection, is at heart an impassioned conservationist. I was unaware, for instance, that many people consider him, as his wife, Rachelle Carson, explains in ''Living With Ed,'' a new reality show about the couple's home life, ''an environmental hero.''\nApparently Mr. Begley has been publicly doing good things for the planet for more than three decades. Admired by people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he is no good-cause opportunist driving around Hollywood in a Prius because that is what the famous and peripherally famous fashionably do. No, Mr. Begley driving a Prius would be like Raymond Chandler writing an installment of the Hardy Boys. Instead he has a Volkswagen reconfigured to run purely on electricity. He relies on it when he's not on his mobile bike, which he uses when not home powering his toaster with energy summoned from a stationary bike.\n''Living With Ed,'' which makes its debut on HGTV on Sunday night, explores a marriage between two people with opposing domestic agendas and it is a delight, a ''Green Acres'' for an era in which we have come to expect Connecticut to feel like Cuba well past Columbus Day. The Begleys live in a modest two-bedroom home in Studio City, Calif., where Ms. Carson has a certain appreciation for fluff: big functionless pillows on her bed to supplement those used for sleeping.\nWhat man really understands boudoir pillows anyway? Mr. Begley doesn't, nor does he understand why his wife takes showers that are way too long or why she doesn't like the look of the energy-saving compact fluorescent lighting he insists on. You quickly see that ecological idealism is not as compatible with the spare aesthetic of affluence as design magazines would have us imagine. Sacrifice is not a living room that looks like a spa in Bali; it is a fence made out of recycled milk jugs.\nMr. Begley happens to have one, but he doesn't demand that you do. He is too eccentrically charming for sanctimony, which is why, it would seem, Ms. Carson remains more amused by her husband than annoyed by him. She can't supply the fakery reality TV demands and consequently is fun to watch.\nThe directors want her to come off as a bit of a gold-digger -- a woman presumably hoping to upgrade to a bigger house where she could leave the lights on all day -- but she isn't a very believable one. It is clear that she is happy just where she is, with a man who composted way before he had a backyard.\nLiving With Ed HGTV, Sunday night at 10, Eastern and Pacific times; 9, Central time.\nBud Brutsman, executive producer; Joseph Brutsman, co-executive producer; Jennifer Shields, supervising producer; Andy Singer, vice president of original programming for HGTV; Ed Begley Jr. and Rachelle Carson, hosts.\nTELEVISION REVIEW\nCorrection: January 18, 2007, Thursday A television review in Weekend on Jan. 5 about the new reality show ''Living With Ed,'' on HGTV, misidentified the car that Ed Begley Jr. drives. It is a Toyota converted to run on electricity, not a Volkswagen.
1816479	AHEAD | Russian Winter Celebrations; All Power to the Parties	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E4DE1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	EVERYONE knows that Russian winters are brutal. Perhaps that's why, as anyone who knows Russian culture can attest, the winter season is also famous for fun -- a festive time for Russians to stave off cold-weather blues.\nAlthough Russians officially switched to the Gregorian calendar after the revolution of 1917, the Russian Orthodox Church has maintained its holiday schedule using the Julian calendar, meaning Christmas is celebrated on the day the Gregorian calendar calls Jan. 7 and New Year on Jan. 14.\nChristmas is mostly a family affair, but come New Year, it's party time. A few weeks later comes the traditional celebration of Maslenitsa, a last-chance party before Lent, like Mardis Gras or Carnival. And because Russians seem to find their holidays too good to leave behind, even if you can't make it all the way to Russia this winter, you can find opportunities to join the celebration.\nLondon, for example, will hold the third Russian Winter Festival this year on Jan. 13, the eve of Orthodox New Year, in Trafalgar Square. And on Feb. 9 in New York, just before Maslenitsa (Feb. 12 to 18 this year), the Russian Children's Welfare Society will hold the 42nd Petroushka Ball. It's a traditional Russian ball, with fine dining, dancing and music at the Waldorf-Astoria. Originally a small, invitation-only charity benefit, the ball, though still formal and rather expensive, is now open to anyone who wants to buy a ticket.\nIn San Francisco, the Russian Center sponsors a less formal but more open winter festival, now in its 19th year. It's roughly scheduled to coincide with Maslenitsa in Russia, where the tradition is for people to take to the streets in brightly colored costumes and masks for bonfires and effigy burnings, sanctioned group fistfights and other alcohol-fueled merriment. Everyone eats the traditional Maslenitsa food: blintzes with butter, jam, caviar and other toppings. Organizers in San Francisco expect to have everything but the fighting for their three-day event, which usually draws about 4,000 people.\n''Maslenitsa actually means something having to do with butter,'' said Zoia Choglokoff, and vice president and director of programs at the center (the Russian word for butter is maslo). ''It means you can have blintzes and butter and drink and so on, and then for six weeks you have to stop it,'' she said. ''It's an old Russian tradition.''\nThe Slavic Festival this weekend in Eugene, Ore., though not exclusively Russian, is held in conjunction with the Russian holidays and features traditional food, dancing, music and art that is mostly Russian. It is sponsored by the Slavic Home, a nonprofit cultural organization.\nOf course, one of the most recognizable elements of Russia's culture is its rich legacy of symphonic music. The New Jersey Symphony Orchestra is taking Russian culture on the road this winter with its Russian Romantics Festival, beginning next week. In a series of concerts around the state, the orchestra will feature the music of Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Borodin and other Russian composers.\nAlso holding a Russian winter festival is the Tucson Symphony Orchestra: four concerts will feature the music of Prokofiev, Mussorgsky and Shostakovich, among others. George Hanson, the symphony's music director and conductor, has long had an interest in Russian music.\nMr. Hanson, who won an ECHO-Klassik award in 2003 in Germany for recordings of works by Anton Rubinstein, finds a passion in Russian music that may be echoed in the enthusiasm the country shows for its holidays. ''When a Russian plays the violin, you never have to wonder if it's a Russian,'' he said. ''They dig in. The hairs on the bow start flying onto the floor. A great performance of a Russian work will draw you into a world where the colors are more vivid and the emotions are more keenly felt.''\nDETAILS\nLONDON -- Trafalgar Square; (44-207) 183-2560; www.eventica.co.uk/events/rwf/2007.\nWhat: Russian Winter Festival; free.\nWhen: Jan. 13.\nNEW YORK -- Russian Children's Welfare Society, (212) 473-6263; www.rcws.org.\nWhat: Petroushka Ball, with dinner, dancing and vocal and balalaika performances; admission from $375.\nWhen: Feb. 9.\nSAN FRANCISCO -- Russian Center of San Francisco, (415) 921-7631; www.russiancentersf.com.\nWhat: Russian Festival in Maslenitsa tradition, $10.\nWhen: Feb. 9 to 11.\nEUGENE, ORE. -- Slavic Home, (541) 510-7651; www.slavichome.org.\nWhat: Slavic Festival, $5 a night.\nWhen: Tomorrow and Sunday.\nNEW JERSEY -- New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, (800) 255-3476; www.njsymphony.org.\nWhat: Russian Romantics festival; most tickets from $20.\nWhen: Jan. 9 to 28.\nTUCSON, ARIZ. -- Tucson Symphony Orchestra, (520) 882-8585; www.tucsonsymphony.org.\nWhat: Russian Festival; from $18.\nWhen: Feb. 8 to March 11.\nAhead

''When she stuck her hand in, he immediately stuck his hand in. They were wrestling for the last few kernels of popcorn while we were performing. Everyone around them was distracted.''\nWhile eating at your seat at a Broadway theater used to be universally forbidden, theaters are increasingly allowing patrons to take their drinks, candy and even crunchy munchies to their seats during a show. This let-them-eat-snacks philosophy has been embraced at the Helen Hayes, Hilton, New Amsterdam, Eugene O'Neill and Walter Kerr Theaters, as well as at all nine houses owned by the Nederlander Organization (the Brooks Atkinson, Gershwin, Lunt-Fontanne, Marquis, Minskoff, Nederlander, Neil Simon, Palace and Richard Rodgers).\n''It's a reflection of changing audience habits,'' said Jim Boese, the organization's vice president. ''As the audience for Broadway expands, there are changing audience needs. This is part of a broader attempt to enhance the audience experience.''\nIt also helps the bottom line for theater owners, who profit from sales at the concession stands. And when people can eat at their seats, they tend to buy more.\nTo make purchases easier, machines to process credit-card sales -- provided by Visa as part of its sponsorship of Broadway -- were recently installed at bars in the New Amsterdam and Nederlander Theaters. There are also plans to create cafe areas with tables and chairs and higher-end products, like high-quality chocolates, in some theaters. One has just been constructed at the Minskoff.\nRosa Hires, the general manager of concessions for the Hilton Theater, owned by Live Nation, said most audience members seemed delighted by the new rules. ''If anything, people want more food,'' she said. ''They're asking for wraps and salads'' to be available at the concession stands, she added. ''Recently we've had people asking for hot dogs.''\nConcession sales there have more than doubled since the Hilton began allowing products other than bottled water to the theater's seats about three years ago, Ms. Hires said. The other theaters mentioned above have seen significant increases as well.\nSome of them have taken steps to minimize distractions and guard against spills. The New Amsterdam, home to ''Mary Poppins,'' serves all drinks -- even Champagne -- in spillproof keepsake plastic cups that muffle the sound of clinking ice, Some Nederlander theaters have begun using similar items, though at these you have to pay for the privilege of taking beverages back to your seat. Wine at the Richard Rogers, where ''Tarzan'' is playing, costs $7 if you drink it in an open cup in the lobby, but is $12 for a spillproof commemorative cup that you are allowed to take back to your seat.\nAll the theater owners whose houses serve food said they were investigating packaging that would reduce wrapper noise. There is no hiding the smell and sound of freshly popped popcorn at the the Neil Simon or the Hilton however.\nIn West End of London, where eating and drinking in the theater has long been allowed, quieter foods, including ice cream, are on the menu.\nBaz Bamigboye, an arts writer for The Daily Mail, said in an e-mail message that in his experience London theatergoers ''try and be considerate,'' while New York audience members often take a contrasting stance. ''I think the view is, 'If we're paying $100 or so for a ticket, we can do what we like,' '' he said of Broadway's audiences.\nAt a recent performance of the child-friendly musical ''Hairspray,'' most of the 50 people interviewed said they were unaware of the rule change; they thought bringing food to a seat had always been allowed.\nTheatergoers at ''Grey Gardens,'' which attracts a metropolitan crowd, were more familiar with past rules and didn't like the present ones. Only 4 out of 50 audience members surveyed said they thought allowing food inside the theater was a good idea. ''I came to hear Christine Ebersole, not a Skittles wrapper,'' Jacquelyn Zimbowne of Newark said after the show.\nGerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, agreed with Ms. Zimbowne. ''It annoys many patrons,'' he said. ''It causes a refuse problem. It damages our carpets. It can be disconcerting to the performers.''\nNo midshow snacking is allowed at any of the Shuberts' 17 Broadway theaters. They restrict drinks and snacks to the lobby area.\nAnd that's the way it should be, Ms. LuPone said. ''Broadway is about a theatrical experience,'' she said. ''It's not about pulling out Marie Callender's chicken pot pie and a Sterno. Would you go to church and pull out a ham sandwich? I don't think so. Then why would you do it at the theater?''
1816483	To Ms. With Love, in a Seething Los Angeles	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E3DE1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	As a cinematic subspecies, films about teachers working with throwaway kids tend to follow a predictable arc involving conflict and resolution, smooth beats and bitter tears. Sometimes, as with ''Dangerous Minds,'' the 1995 film in which Michelle Pfeiffer uses her cheekbones to disarm high school toughs, the results are risible. Sometimes, as with the egregiously offensive ''187'' (1997), wherein Samuel L. Jackson makes like Charles Bronson with some bad students, it's an argument for universal home schooling.\n''Freedom Writers,'' a true story about a white teacher trying to make a difference in a room crammed with black, Latino and Asian high school freshmen, has the makings of another groaner. One worrisome sign is Hilary Swank, the two-time Academy Award winner with the avid smile who recently vamped across screens as a femme fatale in Brian De Palma's period thriller ''The Black Dahlia.'' Ms. Swank is an appealing actress of, at least to date, fairly restricted range. In her finest roles -- a transgender man in ''Boys Don't Cry,'' a boxer in ''Million Dollar Baby'' -- she plays women whose hard-angled limbs and squared jaws never fully obscure a desperate, at times almost embarrassingly naked neediness.\nIn ''Freedom Writers'' Ms. Swank uses that neediness to fine effect in a film with a strong emotional tug and smartly laid foundation. She plays Erin Gruwell, who in 1994 was a 23-year-old student teacher assigned to teach freshman English at Wilson High School in Long Beach, Calif.\nTwenty-two miles from downtown Los Angeles, this ethnically diverse port city, birthplace of both Bo Derek and Snoop Dogg, is south of Compton (home of N.W.A.), right at the edge of Orange County (home of ''The O.C.''). In 1992 the Rodney King riots that rocked Los Angeles spilled into Long Beach; recently the city made news for an alleged hate crime involving black teenagers charged with severely beating three white women.\nBy the time Erin steps into her classroom, a scant two years after the riots, the climate inside is at once frosty and scorching. Turned out in a cherry-red suit and black pumps, her strand of pearls gleaming as bright as her teeth, Erin cuts an unavoidably awkward, borderline goofy figure.\nThe students are understandably skeptical, excruciatingly contemptuous. From where they sit, slumped and hunched, some with their backs literally turned away from the front of the room, Erin looks like the stranger she is. She's an interloper, a do-gooder, a visitor from another planet called Newport Beach, and the class sees through her as if she were glass because the writer and director Richard LaGravenese makes sure that we do too.\nFunny how point of view works. If so many films about so-called troubled teenagers come off as little more than exploitation, it's often because the filmmakers are not really interested in them, just their dysfunction. ''Freedom Writers,'' by contrast, isn't only about an amazingly dedicated young teacher who took on two extra jobs to buy supplies for her students (to supplement, as Mr. LaGravenese carefully points out, a $27,000 salary); it's also, emphatically, about some extraordinary young people. In this respect Mr. LaGravenese, whose diverse writing credits include ''The Ref'' and ''The Bridges of Madison County,'' appears to have taken his egalitarian cue from the real Erin Gruwell, who shares author credit with her students in their 1999 book, ''The Freedom Writers Diary,'' a collection of their journal entries.\nMr. LaGravenese keeps faith with the multiple perspectives in the book, which includes Ms. Gruwell's voice and those of her students, whose first-person narratives pay witness to the effects of brutalizing violence, dangerous tribal allegiances and institutional neglect. The film pops in on Erin and her increasingly troubled relationship with her husband, Scott (Patrick Dempsey), and there's a really lovely scene between the two that finds them talking ruefully over a bottle of wine about the divide between fantasy and reality in marriage, a divide one partner tries to bridge and the other walks away from. But while we keep time with Erin, we also listen to the teenagers, several of whom tell their stories in voice-over.\nAmong the most important of those stories is that of Eva (the newcomer April Lee Hernandez), whose voice is among the first we hear in the film. Through quick flashbacks and snapshot scenes of the present, Eva's young life unfolds with crushing predictability. From her front steps, this 9-year-old watches as her cousin is gunned down in a drive-by shooting. Later her father is arrested; she's initiated into a gang. One day, while walking with a friend under the glorious California sun, a couple of guys pull up in a car and start firing in their direction. Eva dodges bullets and embraces violence because she knows nothing else; she hates everyone, including her white teacher, because no one has ever given her a reason not to.\nIn time Eva stops hating Erin, though the bullets keep coming. It's a hard journey for both women, one that includes other students, most of whom are played by actors who look too old for their roles and are nonetheless very affecting. None of these actors are outstanding, but two are memorable: the singer Mario, who plays an angry drug dealer, Andre, and another newcomer, Jason Finn, whose big, soft, moon face swells with fury and vulnerability as a homeless teenager named Marcus.\nMr. LaGravenese isn't a natural-born filmmaker, but he's a smart screenwriter whose commitment to characters like Marcus makes up for the rough patches in his directing. Like Ms. Swank, who shares the screen comfortably with her younger co-stars, he gives credit where credit is due.\n''Freedom Writers'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There is some gun violence and adult language.\nFreedom Writers Opens today nationwide.\nWritten and directed by Richard LaGravenese; based on the book ''The Freedom Writers Diary'' by the Freedom Writers with Erin Gruwell; director of photography, Jim Denault; production designer, Laurence Bennett; produced by Stacey Sher and Michael Shamberg; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 123 minutes.\nWITH: Hilary Swank (Erin), Patrick Dempsey (Scott), April Lee Hernandez (Eva), Scott Glenn (Steve), Mario (Andre), Jason Finn (Marcus) and Hunter Parrish (Ben).\nFILM REVIEW\nCorrection: January 10, 2007, Wednesday The headline for a film review in Weekend on Friday about ''Freedom Writers'' misidentified the California city in which the movie is set.

Mr. DiCaprio was nominated in the lead-actor category for his performance in ''Blood Diamond'' and for his supporting role in ''The Departed.'' Ms. Mirren, right, was nominated for her depiction of Queen Elizabeth II in ''The Queen'' and of Queen Elizabeth I in ''Elizabeth I,'' an HBO prime-time production. As a leading man, Mr. DiCaprio will compete against Ryan Gosling in ''Half Nelson,'' Peter O'Toole in ''Venus,'' Will Smith in ''The Pursuit of Happyness'' and Forest Whitaker in ''The Last King of Scotland.'' Ms. Mirren's competitors in the best actress category in feature films are Penélope Cruz in ''Volver,'' Judi Dench in ''Notes on a Scandal,'' Meryl Streep in ''The Devil Wears Prada'' and Kate Winslet in ''Little Children.'' Supporting actor nominees, besides Mr. DiCaprio, were Alan Arkin, Jackie Earle Haley, Djimon Hounsou and Eddie Murphy; supporting actress nominees were Adriana Barraza, Cate Blanchett, Abigail Breslin, Jennifer Hudson and Rinko Kikuchi. The winners will be announced at a ceremony to be broadcast from Los Angeles on TNT and TBS on Jan. 28.\nOmarion Starting The New Year on Top\nThe new album by Omarion, below, ''21'' (Epic), captured the No. 1 spots on the Billboard post-Christmas 200 and R&B/Hip-Hop album charts, with sales of 119,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan estimates. Akon's ''Konvicted'' (SRC/Universal) climbed from 10th place to second even though sales declined more than 50 percent, to 112,000. The ''Dreamgirls'' (Sony) soundtrack vaulted from 31st to third place, despite a sales decline of 16.6 percent, to 104,000 albums; and last week's chart-topper, Nas's ''Hip-Hop Is Dead'' (Def Jam), fell to fourth place, with a 71 percent slump in sales, to 101,000. The Young Jeezy album ''The Inspiration'' (Def Jam) re-entered the Top Five, moving from 18th place to 5th.\nDead but Not Quite Buried\n''Zyzzyx Rd.'' has earned a place in the record book, Variety reported yesterday, for ''the lowest tally for any pic since modern record-keeping began in the 1980s.'' While films like ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,'' ''Cars'' and ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' were pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars last year, ''Zyzzyx Rd.'' (pronounced ZY-zix) amassed a total of $30. The film, starring Tom Sizemore, Katherine Heigl and Leo Grillo, opened its six-day run in February in Dallas, making $20 in its debut showing, followed by an additional $10. The plot of the 90-minute thriller, written and directed by John Penney, involves a philandering accountant (Mr. Grillo) who goes to Las Vegas on a business trip. There he encounters the seductive Marissa (Ms. Heigl) and her jealous ex-boyfriend, Joey (Mr. Sizemore), whom they kill and bury in the Mojave Desert, the site of Zzyzx Road in Zzyzx, Calif. A summary written by the producer (Mr. Penney again) says, ''In the 'Death of a Salesman' meets 'Lolita' ending, 'Zyzzyx Rd.' reveals a shocking, tragic twist.''
1816485	And You'll Be a Moviegoer, My Son	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E2DE1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	''Mothers of America, let your kids go to the movies!'' Always good advice, but the exhortation has dated a bit since 1960, when Frank O'Hara made it the first line of his poem ''Ave Maria.'' ''Going to the movies'' has a quaint ring in the age of the plasma-screen home entertainment system, the iPod and video-on-demand.\nThe movies are more than willing to come to us, which has inspired some sages, in and outside the film industry, to prophesy the obsolescence, or at least the increasing marginality, of paper tickets, bags of popcorn and big dark rooms lighted by a projector beam: the cultural ritual known dispassionately in the business as ''theatrical distribution.''\nAccording to this vision, children are leading the slow exodus from the theaters. From an essay in the current issue of The New Yorker, for example, one learns that, when it comes to visual entertainment, kids these days are ''platform agnostic,'' perfectly happy to consume moving pictures wherever they pop up -- in the living room, on the laptop, in the car, on the cellphone -- without assigning priority among the various forms. David Denby, the author of the article and one of The New Yorker's film critics, is an unapologetic adherent to the old-time religion, as am I, and his survey of the current technological landscape is colored by nostalgia for the old downtown movie palaces and the studio system that fed them.\nOf course, as Mr. Denby acknowledges, children have hardly disappeared from the movie audience. On the contrary, adolescents and their younger siblings are the most sought-after segments of the demographically segmented universe of potential viewers. The movies that make the most money, and therefore those on which the most production and advertising money is spent, are the ones that simultaneously reach down into the primary grades and up into the ranks of young adults.\nAnd there is special commercial potency in those movies that parents will be eager to see -- sometimes more than once -- with their children. Usually animated, always featuring big stars and wholesome lessons, these films are the ones pointedly aimed at the whole family: cute animals (and product tie-in toys) for the little ones, semi-naughty humor and exciting action for their older brothers and sisters, enough in the way of topicality or sophistication to keep mom and dad from losing their minds.\nIf you have children between the ages of, say, 4 and 12, you don't need a list of these movies, and chances are that, during the holiday school vacation, you have already seen ''Charlotte's Web,'' ''Happy Feet'' and ''Night at the Museum,'' just as you saw ''Over the Hedge'' and ''Cars'' earlier last year and will see ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Shrek 3'' in a few months. In many ways the ascension of these movies is an encouraging development. Because entertainment aimed at children occupies a bigger share of the marketplace, the level of quality tends to be higher than it was, say, back in the heyday of Walt Disney live-action comedies. And the phenomenon of family viewing -- the mothers and fathers of America taking their children to the movies -- has become a central cultural activity consistent with the highly participatory style of parenthood currently in vogue.\nI would not wish it otherwise, but I also worry that the dominance of the family film has had a limiting, constraining effect on the imaginations of children. The point of Mr. O'Hara's poem is that the movies represent a zone of mystery and cultural initiation: ''it's true that fresh air is good for the body,'' he writes, ''but what about the soul/that grows in darkness, embossed by silvery images''?\nNever mind that he also reminds his mothers that their offspring ''may even be grateful to you for their first sexual experience, which only cost you a quarter and didn't upset the peaceful home.'' How are they going to grow, if the images they see are carefully vetted for safety and appropriateness by the film industry?\nIn other words: Parents of America, take your children to the movies you want to see! Within reason, naturally. I cringe at the sight of strollers at ''Apocalypto'' or ''Saw III.'' But I also cringe at the timidity and cautiousness -- the hypersensitivity -- that confines family viewing to movies with a plush toy or fast food advertising tie-in.\nAt their best, movies not only offer glimpses of fantastic imaginary worlds, but also inklings of what is, for children, the most intriguing and enigmatic world of all: the world of adulthood.\nFor the last six months or so, in the guise of a civilian moviegoer, I have been conducting (with the sometimes unwitting assistance of my wife) a cautious, intermittent experiment. Ignoring the advice of the Motion Picture Association of America and the studio marketing departments about what my children, who are 10 and 7, should see, I have taken them to revival houses and museums as well as to multiplexes; to musicals and subtitled films as well as to risqué action blockbusters and not-too-explicit love stories.\nThis experiment has proceeded along two tracks, with two distinct but complementary intentions. I want them to learn to appreciate the varieties of this incomparably rich art form, which means learning to endure and even enjoy being occasionally bored, confused or scared. I also hope they will develop a taste for the act of moviegoing.\nThe recent releases they have seen include ''Casino Royale,'' ''The Illusionist'' and ''The Pursuit of Happyness,'' none of which bored them or troubled their sleep and all of which seemed to me to be much better suited for their age cohort than mine. ''The Illusionist,'' in particular, with its star-crossed romance, its theatrical effects and its carefully turned plot twists, struck me as the kind of thing that would delight a bookish, intellectually curious fourth or fifth grader, and I was startled to see it in a theater full of adults. But I was gratified to hear my own children, on the subway ride home, puzzling out the intricacies of the plot and arguing about its ambiguities, just as the grownups did.\nOur house is full of DVDs, many of them acknowledged classics, reissued and remastered for rediscovery. And we have watched Charlie Chaplin and John Wayne, ''Casablanca'' and ''Frankenstein.'' But we also comb through the weekend movie listings in search of those dwindling numbers of screens that will show us old movies the old-fashioned way. On Saturdays we frequently find ourselves in sparsely peopled rooms staring at ancient shadows.\nSome adjustment of expectations is required: in the old movies people frequently talk faster and move more slowly. They burst into song without self-consciousness. There are fewer cuts, longer scenes and occasional visual anomalies.\n''Why is he purple?'' my daughter asked in the middle of ''West Side Story,'' noticing the effects of an aging Technicolor print on Tony's face. In ''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'' the tint would periodically switch from sepia to silver and back again. My son, noting each shift, wanted to know why it was happening: a question about aesthetics that I could only answer with a whispered lecture about chemistry. Most of the old movies he had seen were delivered by means of new technology; this one was old in the physical as well as the cultural sense.\nWhat he made of it I don't know. (He was amused that Lee Marvin, as the titular villain, calls Jimmy Stewart's character ''dude.'') But he watched with an unusual intentness, the same quality of attention he brought to ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail,'' ''Oliver'' and ''Samurai Rebellion,'' some of the other stops on our haphazard tour of movie history. I'm convinced that these films' beguiling strangeness was magnified by the experience of seeing them away from home and its distractions, with the whir of the projector faintly audible in the background and motes of dust suspended in the path from projector to screen.\nMoviegoing, though unlikely to disappear, will probably never again be the universal rite it once was. This is not a catastrophe, just a change of habit. Going to the movies may survive as an acquired taste, and also, therefore, as an activity through which taste is acquired.\nFILM

1816487	Artists Caught in the Act	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E1DE1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	In a formal museum setting, there's nothing quite like a depiction of an artist at work to lower your guard. Especially in older art. Whether by Degas or Rockwell, these scenes frequently combine the allure of intimate, taboo or arcane knowledge with an irresistibility similar to that exerted by small cute things, like puppies or babies. They let us inside and they soften us up, offering a mix of reality and romance that is the visual equivalent of a backstage tour or a behind-the-music video. We see an artist's process, circumstances or sense of self, and glimpse the tools and tricks of a given trade. The seeming collapse of art's fourth wall is almost inevitably thrilling.\nI realized this at the Metropolitan Museum of Art a couple of days before Christmas, when I was suddenly brought up short by ''In the Studio,'' a midsize canvas from 1888 by Alfred Stevens (1823-1906), a Paris-based Belgian painter who was a friend of Manet's. If not entirely enthralled by the fussy realism of the painting -- which hangs in the long, wide thoroughfare that leads past the 19th-Century Paintings and Sculpture Galleries -- I became fascinated with its story line and the spell it cast.\nI began to wonder what else the Met might have on view in the way of images of artists or artisans at work. Aided by suggestions from several Met curators, I set forth under crowded holiday conditions a few days before New Year's Eve, combing the collection for moments of self-disclosure, self-reference and self-celebration.\nSince I had previously only glanced at the Stevens in passing and never focused on its title, I think I must have assumed that it showed three women having tea. Wrong. It shows three women (and a fourth under construction) having what might today be identified as a studio visit.\nThe artist -- hair up, wearing a smock -- stands to one side, resting her elbow familiarly on the upper edge of a painting in progress. On the canvas is a brushed-in rendering of the woman at the left, who sits cross-legged on a cushy russet sofa, holding a pose, hair down, wearing a shimmering gold robe and holding in her lap a gold platter. The label explains that she is posing as Salome (the platter awaits John the Baptist's head); that the painting and the studio are Stevens's own; and that the image is similar to a well-known Salome painted in 1870 by Henri Regnault. (Conveniently, it is in the Met's collection and hanging next to the Stevens.)\nClose to the artist and her painting sits an alert, engaged visitor, a young woman dressed in a proper, high-necked black day suit, possibly offering a friendly outside opinion. As usual with paintings of this sort, the furnishings are a calculated mix of exotic and functional, including an animal-skin rug; a small, messy chest of drawers; and a silk screen. On the wall is a veritable catalog of pictorial idioms and cultural influences: a cluster of small contemporary paintings, a Japanese hanging scroll (and small parasol) and a convex mirror whose reflection has a dark, old masterish mien.\nAs with the mirrors in Velázquez's ''Meninas,'' arguably art's greatest image of an artist at work, the mirror extends the painting's spatial illusion outward. It circles behind us and puts us in the picture, a frequent hook in images of artists at work.\nAnd what did Stevens -- who was unusually welcoming to female pupils -- mean by painting a woman painting Salome? Perhaps he was being a man of his time, warning against feminine wiles. Or perhaps he was a little ahead, suggesting the unacknowledged power of women as artists.\nThe notion of the artist as a worthy subject for art became especially prominent in the West in the 17th century and was further bolstered by the onset of Romanticism in the first half of the 19th. So I wasn't surprised that most, but happily not all, of the working artists I came across at the Met were in works made in Europe or the United States after 1750.\nThese portrayals can range from realistic portraits or self-portraits to caricatures or symbolic surrogates. You can see what I mean downstairs from the Stevens, on the first floor of the Lila Acheson Wallace Wing. Just to the right of the entrance is a nice antidote to the hot-house detail of the Stevens: Édouard Vuillard's almost vaporous ''Self-Portrait With a Friend,'' from 1889. The painting discreetly tips its hat to ''Las Meninas'' with the doubled liquor bottle in the lower right corner, which recasts the painting as the mirror in which Vuillard studies his reflection while painting the work we are looking at.\nThe self-portrait is a medley of soft, loosely brushed greens and grays and merging shapes that shows Vuillard with brush and palette, while a male friend stands just a little behind him on his left. It suggests attention to Degas and perhaps Whistler at a point when Vuillard was finding himself as an artist. Within a year or two, he would be on his own in the close, flattened interiors populated by his family and its wallpaper, blended suggestively together with tactile dabs of paint. Here he seems to assess his prospects with quiet, unhurried confidence.\nThe figure of the artist is considerably more abstract and symbolic in George Braque's ''Woman Seated at an Easel'' in the same galleries. Painted in 1936, it entered the Met's collection only in 1996, with the Florene M. Schoenborn bequest. As in the Stevens, the artist is female, but she is also a sign: a cut-and-folded descendant of the Cubist muses who has taken up the brush herself, possibly to make a self-portrait. But the main event here is the play of light and dark that subdivides the whole scene: artist, palette and easel, even the lemons in a still life hanging on the wall, but most dramatically the patterned wallpaper behind her, creating a trapezoid of yellow that, not unlike a mirror, indicates an unseen window, curtains included. The painting's puzzlelike richness of interlocking shapes and patterns reminds us how great Braque could be, after Picasso.\nNearby, overlooking a gallery of classically demure European modernist works, Red Grooms's clunky, comical homage ''Chance Encounter at 3 A.M.'' fuzzes the line between working and not working. This large, tactile canvas -- whose heroic scale evokes New York School painting -- shows Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning sitting stiffly on a bench in Washington Square Park, smoking and staring into space, with the panorama of the arch, 1 Fifth Avenue and Washington Square North (where Edward Hopper had his studio) behind them.\nThey wear paint-splattered clothes and startled expressions, as if they have both just bolted from uncooperative works-in-progress. Their stiff demeanor suggests mutual surprise (misery doesn't love company?) and indicates, perhaps, that for some artists, not working is just a less productive, more tormented form of working. The muse of painting drifts above them in a green party dress. The painting documents the artists' first meeting, although it occurred in the 1930s, not in the '50s, as the setting here suggests.\nMeanwhile, not too far into the European Painting Galleries at the top of the Met's grand staircase, you'll find two depictions of women making art, at opposite ends of a long wall in the second large gallery. The more opulent is Adélaïde Labille-Guiard's 1785 ''Self-Portrait With Two Pupils,'' which shows the beautifully dressed artist, in a frothy gown and an elegant feathered hat, busily at work while two respectful female pupils look on. She glances up from her easel, toward her subject, us. Labille-Guiard (1749-1803) was an established artist who segued from portraits of royals to portraits of the Revolutionary government. Trained by a miniaturist, she was unfailingly attentive to details of dress and furniture. Here the tour de force may be the parquet floor.\nAt the other end of the wall, Marie-Denise Villers's 1801 ''Young Woman Drawing'' shows another beautiful woman looking up from her work as if, again, we are the sitters. The intervening 16 years have brought great change: the simple white, high-waisted muslin gown and the spare setting of the Villers attest to the passing of Rococo and the rise of Neo-Classicism. But for all its restraint, the picture, a possible self-portrait, advertises Villers's skills. Because of a gaping hole in the lower right pane, the view outside -- of a building and a couple on a balustrade -- is painted in two subtly contrasting tones, one through dusty glass, the other en plein air.\nNo disrespect intended, but the Met's musical instrument galleries are a useful shortcut from the European galleries to the American Wing, which is in excellent shape these days and rife with paintings of working artists. And sculptures, too. On the mezzanine of the Engelhard Court, you can take in Daniel Chester French's theatrical ''Angel of Death and the Sculptor from the Milmore Memorial.'' This larger-than-life marble tableau from 1926, based on a turn-of-the-century bronze, memorializes the sculptor Martin Milmore, who died in 1883 at 39. Death is a Pre-Raphaelite Amazon, with enormous wings, Grecian gown and cantilevered shroud. She stays the chisel of the Peter Pan-ish artist as he fashions a relief of the Sphinx. His sleeveless T-shirt is worthy of Bruce Springsteen.\nIn the American Wing's painting galleries, the first notable sight is Thomas Cole's classic panoramic view of the Ox-Bow of the Connecticut River from Mount Holyoke, near Northampton, Mass. As the eye sweeps across the valley and its loop of shining water, don't miss Cole himself. He's down the hill a bit, in a red shirt and a high hat, sitting at the easel between two boulders. It is 1836, and he looks back over his shoulder as if to catch our eye: Look at me. I'm painting America as never before.\nThe challenge of being an American painter must have been on Matthew Pratt's mind decades earlier, when he painted a group portrait presciently called ''The American School'' in London in 1765. In this silken image, three young artists so soft-skinned they might almost be babies group around a table while a slightly older artist, possibly Benjamin West, examines a drawing proffered by one. Pratt includes himself at the right, but looking more mature and with a painter's tools and a just-started canvas. The main pictorial action is determined by shifting levels of the men's heads and the more regular rhythms of their neatly stockinged calves, alternating with the wood legs of chairs, table and easel.\nSeveral works near the Pratt, and in surrounding galleries, amount to a vigorous debate between sophisticated realism and naïve rendering. That exchange finds a certain resolution in the quiet, stiff accuracy of the Pratt.\nOn the north balcony you'll find several paintings of artists at work clustered in a corner, as well as Louis Moeller's delectable, if empty, ''Sculptor's Studio,'' a meticulous study in shades of gray, beige and white that a Met curator recommended, even though it didn't quite fill the artist-at-work imperative. I can see why. On the mezzanine level below, you'll find Samuel Aloysius Murray's small 1907 bronze of Thomas Eakins sitting cross-legged on the floor with his palette (the label says he is working on ''The Agnew Clinic,'' which was too big for the easel) and Louis Lang's ''Women's Art Class,'' from around 1868.\nAs mentioned, not all the artists at work in the Met's art are Western. A door in the long hallway in the American Wing leads to the Japanese galleries and the marvelous installation ''Flowing Streams,'' which includes two hanging scrolls, side by side, both titled ''The Poetry Gathering at the Orchid Pavilion.''\nOne was painted in 1816 by Okada Beisanjin, the other in 1855 by Yamamoto Baiitsu. Like the efforts of earlier Chinese and Japanese painters, these works commemorate a legendary (but real) get-together that is often seen as the genesis of the literati tradition of the scholar-painter.\nThe gathering was convened in 353 by Wang Xizhi (303-361), the period's premier calligrapher, in Zhejiang province in southern China. In the 1855 version, the poets enjoy a drunken frolic beside a winding stream. In the earlier one, they are more subdued and isolated, with the visual buzz provided mostly by strange pretzel-like rocks (scholar's rocks crossed with Barbara Hepworth). In both images you can make out the tiny figure of Wang in the middle distance, at a table with brush and paper. In the Yamamoto he is seated in the pavilion contemplating some waterfowl in the lake before him. In the Okada he is already at work, in the open air.\nDirectly below the Asian wing, a curator's suggestion steered me to a rare image of Egyptian sculptors at work. (It is in Gallery 26 of the Egyptian wing, at the bottom of the stairs leading from the Asian.) On display are tempera copies of wall paintings in a tomb at Thebes that were made in 1927 by the artist Nina de Garis Davies (1881-1965), although Davies's name is not on the label. The image is high on a wall in group 33 and shows five artists on a scaffold, working collectively and in strict profile, polishing and inscribing a large royal statue.\nYou could say that a work of art is remade every time someone savors it in a long, thorough way. Absorbing art's effect and grasping its meaning starts partly by deciphering the how and what of its physical particulars. It was in that spirit that two curators who specialize in art from opposite sides of the globe and widely spaced centuries, displayed in galleries on opposite sides of the museum, arrived at a similar conclusion.\nBoth recommended abstract works with nary an artist, studio or tool in sight. But both works convey, as each curator said in slightly different ways, the essence of the artist's gestures and being -- and nothing more or less. One, you may have guessed, is Jackson Pollock's extravagant yet ordered whirlwind, ''Autumn Rhythm (Number 30)'' of 1950. The other is a hand scroll by the Chinese calligrapher Huang Tingjian in the marvelous exhibition ''Brush and Ink'' in the Chinese art galleries of the Asian wing. Working in the 11th century, Huang wanted to liberate calligraphy and make it more personally expressive, which is confirmed by the way his characters dance and unravel across the paper. If you decide to see the two works in succession, you might travel between them on a route that takes you through the Belfer Court and pre-Classical Greece. There, with more curatorial guidance, I found another rare portrayal of a working artist, this one from the late eighth or early seventh century B.C. and displayed in a vitrine just inside the court (on the right, coming from the great hall).\nIt is a delightful, if relatively minute, bronze of an armorer working on a bronze helmet. Clearly related to the abbreviated, sticklike figures on the large vases in the vicinity, it has a plasticity and life force all its own. Like Alfred Stevens's painting of the all-girl studio visit, it is something you might have passed, oblivious, more times than you can count.\nART
1816488	New U.N. Health Chief Sets Her Priorities	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E4DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Dr. Margaret F. C. Chan took office yesterday as the World Health Organization's director general, saying her two chief goals are to improve the health of Africans and of women throughout the world.\nWomen face risks during pregnancy and childbirth that make them particularly vulnerable to health problems, said Dr. Chan, 59, a former Hong Kong health chief. On the positive side, they can be powerful agents of change for better health.\n''Women do much more than have babies,'' Dr. Chan said in a statement on the agency's Web site. Speaking to reporters yesterday by telephone from the health organization's headquarters in Geneva, she added that women were a rising influence in the work force and in their communities -- particularly since so many teachers and health care workers were women.\nThe organization's member countries elected Dr. Chan as director general in November after the sudden death of Dr. Lee Jong-wook on May 22.\nAt the time of her election, she noted that ''the people of Africa carry an enormous and disproportionate burden of ill health and premature death.'' Yesterday, she told her staff that ''poor health and poverty are closely tied, as are better health and the prospects for development.''\nEfforts are needed to strengthen the weak national health systems that are Africa's biggest public health challenge, Dr. Chan said.\nBut over all, she said, ''These are optimistic times for health.''\n''Never before has our work enjoyed such a high profile on the political agenda,'' she continued, adding, ''Health has never before seen such wealth.''\nBut while the profile of global health has been raised by programs financed by the United States and other wealthy countries -- and by donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other philanthropies -- there is a need to strengthen the political commitment and resources, Dr. Chan said.\nHealth workers need to work with such partners to coordinate efforts to ensure lasting improvements without overburdening poor countries, she said. Also, she said, the World Health Organization and other agencies needed to assure that the donations were met with strong political will within affected countries.\nShe cautioned that poor countries did not want to be told what to do, preferring to come up with plans that met their own needs.\nDr. Chan challenged health workers to improve their efforts to provide treatment and prevention for diseases like malaria.\nAt a White House meeting on malaria last month, she said, she heard about an area in Rwanda that had only three hospitals and 15 clinics, but 800 churches. Health workers need to ask whether they have reached out enough to such nongovernmental groups to help deliver what people need to fight disease and poverty, she said.\nDr. Chan pledged to have the World Health Organization become more accountable in reporting on the performance of its programs. The agency's budget depends heavily on contributions from governments, and donors are demanding results, she said.\n''We are being held accountable to what we promised to deliver,'' she said, adding, ''I know I am being closely observed.''\nDr. Chan is the first person from China to head a United Nations agency. China has been criticized severely for not sharing information with the world about diseases like influenza and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Asked whether she felt pressure to favor China, Dr. Chan pledged to be fair, transparent and accountable. ''As an international civil servant, I commit to serve the interests of the member states of the organization,'' she said.\n''When the evidence is clear and health is at stake, the director general must be prepared to take a stand on difficult, and at times political, issues that affect health,'' she said.\nDr. Chan, who earned her medical degree from the University of Western Ontario in Canada, cited a list of chronic diseases and other problems that were creating new challenges for poor countries. Among them are violence, injuries, heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease and mental illness.\nIn recent decades, as progress in medicine raced ahead, resources for public health grew more slowly, leading to greater global imbalances. Some people live longer and healthier lives while others die prematurely from preventable diseases. ''This is not a healthy situation -- for populations or world security,'' Dr. Chan said.\nDr. Chan, who most recently was the health organization's assistant director general for communicable diseases, urged the world to remain vigilant against the threat of H5N1 avian influenza. The peak flu season normally occurs during cold weather. ''Complacency is our biggest enemy,'' she said, in preparing for the next influenza pandemic that could be caused by any strain. She said that scientists had not learned enough about the role of migratory birds in spreading avian flu viruses.\nDr. Chan also pledged to complete the campaign to eradicate polio.
1816489	Somali Government Seeks to Tighten Its Grip Amid Chaos	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E4DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	A hand grenade was tossed into a government army compound on Thursday night in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, in yet another sign of growing chaos in the country.\nJust days after Ethiopian-led troops helped rout once powerful Islamist forces in Somalia and install a new government in the capital, security seemed to be unraveling across the country.\nThe violence is surging on two fronts: antigovernment attacks and increased banditry, both of which were virtually unheard of during the Islamists' short-lived reign.\nWitnesses said that shortly after nightfall, a man in a pickup truck flung a grenade over a wall and into a compound that housed Ethiopian and government soldiers. Apparently, no one was seriously hurt and the pickup truck escaped in a blaze of gunfire.\nIn northern Mogadishu, residents said that four people were killed Wednesday night after bandits fired a bazooka at a truck whose driver refused to pay an extortion tax. Unauthorized checkpoints have popped up all over the city, reminiscent of the years of anarchy when clan-based militias carved up Mogadishu -- and much of the rest of Somalia, for that matter.\nIn Dhagtur, in central Somalia, Shabelle radio reported Thursday that five people, including two children, were killed by a tribal militia during a gun battle. A dispute over a well was cited as the possible cause.\nBut despite the worsening violence, Somalia's transitional government is moving to consolidate its tenuous grip on power. On Thursday, Ali Mohammed Gedi, the veterinarian who is now prime minister, appointed more than 30 new judges, including two women.\n''Quite soon, the police stations in Mogadishu will be operational,'' Mr. Gedi said. ''If a criminal is arrested, the police will have the access to put the criminal on trial.''\nSince Somalia's central government collapsed in 1991, the wheels of justice have rusted over, leaving few functioning police stations, jails or courts.\nMr. Gedi also pushed ahead with his disarmament plan, extending until Saturday a deadline for turning in guns and threatening house-to-house searches if the guns were not surrendered.\nIn Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, announced Thursday that Uganda was ready to volunteer a battalion of around 800 soldiers to serve as peacekeepers in Somalia. The African Union is trying to cobble together a peacekeeping force to take the place of Ethiopian troops and lend much-needed muscle to the transitional government.\nThe transitional government is still battling the last remnants of the Islamist forces, who have fled to a remote, heavily forested area in southern Somalia along the Kenyan border. Somali officials said that several hundred Islamist fighters were cornered, and that it was only a matter of days until the Islamist movement, which had ruled much of Somalia for the past six months until Ethiopian forces intervened, was finished for good.
1816490	Turkmen Leader Proposes Vast Change to Lift Isolation	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E4DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Turkmenistan's acting president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, who had promised only continuity with the severely authoritarian policies of his predecessor, on Thursday proposed measures that would help lift the nation from its fortresslike isolation.\nMr. Berdymukhammedov promised a laundry list of changes affecting agriculture, social assistance programs, education and the economy. The proposals, outlined in a speech in Ashgabat, the capital, included giving students access to foreign universities -- including those in the United States -- sending doctors to Western hospitals to acquire modern skills and extending primary schooling to 10 years. Mr. Berdymukhammedov also vowed to create a culture of entrepreneurship, suggesting that he would encourage private ownership of some residences and businesses. Almost all economic activity in Turkmenistan is tied to the government.\nHe also promised to allow universal access to the Internet. Turkmens are allowed almost no contact with the outside world. In recent years, even foreign newspapers and cable television from Russia were prohibited under the mercurial rule of Saparmurat Niyazov, the ''president for life,'' who died on Dec. 21. Simply receiving a telephone call originating in a foreign country can arouse the interest of Turkmenistan's feared security apparatus, said Turkmens who had spoken to journalists.\nMr. Berdymukhammedov's public comments underscored the fluidity of the nation's opaque politics as it prepares for a presidential election on Feb. 11, foreign analysts said.\n''I think there is a much more deeply rooted struggle for power in Turkmenistan than we originally thought,'' said Martha Brill Olcott, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, in a telephone interview.\nAs acting president, Mr. Berdymukhammedov, a former deputy prime minister, was prohibited by the Constitution from seeking the presidency. But the national legislature simply changed the rules to allow him to run and then approved a slate of colorless, midlevel bureaucrats and politicians as false opposition candidates.\nBut Mr. Berdymukhammedov may fear that such tactics are backfiring, Dr. Olcott said, strengthening the opposition in exile and increasing the chances that his opponents will gain support from Western governments.\n''Berdymukhammedov is seeking ways to appease the foreign community in order to get support for a very nondemocratic constitution modified in a very nondemocratic way, and to validate an election in which the electoral process was flawed from the beginning,'' she said.\nThe government trumpets its policy of geopolitical neutrality, but Turkmenistan's dependence on customers for its enormous natural gas deposits has given outside powers, especially Russia, Europe and the United States, significant influence.\nBut few signs of outside pressure have been seen.\nThe ''Turkmenistan government is going to have to moderate their own political process,'' Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said Wednesday, when asked by reporters how the United States would respond to recent lobbying from Turkmen opposition figures for support of the country's exiled political opposition.\nIn his speech, Mr. Berdymukhammedov also promised to double state pensions, student stipends and government salaries, to build resorts on the Caspian Sea and to continue Mr. Niyazov's popular program of distributing water, salt and gasoline free.
1816491	Pakistan Premier Wants Afghan Refugees to Return Home	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E3DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Pakistan's prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, said Thursday that he wanted the three million Afghan refugees still living in Pakistan to go home as one way to end the problem of insurgents using the country as a haven.\nIt is the first time Pakistan has been so blunt in demanding that the Afghans, to whom it has served as host for more than 20 years since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, leave.\nMr. Aziz arrived here for talks with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, in an effort to smooth tensions between the neighbors, but after more than two hours Mr. Karzai acknowledged that relations were only growing worse.\n''Unfortunately, the gulf in relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan is getting wider, and it is not getting narrower,'' Mr. Karzai said after their meeting.\nThe two leaders emerged with no agreement on the main areas of contention, namely Pakistan's plan to fence and mine the border, and Afghanistan's project to convene two tribal gatherings, or jirgas, of national representatives from both countries, to try to foster peace between the countries.\nShortly before the meeting, Pakistan announced that it was going ahead with a plan to fence and mine the long mountainous border. Afghanistan has repeatedly condemned the project as a diversion from the real problem of terrorism, which it says is being incubated in Pakistan. Pakistan has also dragged its feet on organizing the tribal gatherings, promising only to form a commission to work on the idea.\n''The Afghan people want to remove all those obstacles which create the divide in our relations,'' Mr. Karzai said. ''Those obstacles are created by terrorist activities which are hindering Afghanistan's reconstruction and making our schools burn.\n''Security will not come to Afghanistan unless together we and Pakistan, with good and friendly relations, become tough in the fight against terrorism,'' he added. He said he wanted to hold the tribal jirgas so people could speak their minds.\nWithout offering specifics, Mr. Aziz said the two leaders agreed to work on resettling three million Afghan refugees back in Afghanistan and removing the sanctuary that refugee camps provide to insurgents.\n''Refugee camps on our side of the border sometimes are safe havens for elements who are from Afghanistan and take safe haven there after conducting activities,'' he said.\nHe also defended Pakistan's plan to fence and mine the border as one way to restrict the movement of people who represent a threat to security. ''We believe that selective fencing and mining can help achieve the objective,'' he said, adding that the fence and mines would not prevent the ordinary crossing of local tribes.
1816492	Parks Agency Leaves Controversial Book on Shelf	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E3DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	When complaints emerged in 2004 over the sale of a creationist account of the formation of the Grand Canyon in National Park Service bookstores, Interior Department officials said they would review whether the book should be pulled from the shelves.\nBut there was no formal review, in part because of differences of opinion among the Park Service's own specialists, said David Barna, a spokesman for the agency, in an interview yesterday.\nWhen officials got together to discuss the book, the geologists and natural resource specialists would say, ''Get this book out of here,'' Mr. Barna said. ''But the education and interpretation people would say: 'Wait a minute. If your science is so sound, the fact that there are differences of opinion should not scare you away.' ''\nIn the end, no formal action was taken, and the book remains on sale because, Mr. Barna said in a written statement, ''It is not our role to tell people what to believe.''\nThe Park Service issued the statement after an organization of state and federal natural resource managers, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, or PEER, said it had filed a Freedom of Information Act request concerning the agency's handling of the book, ''Grand Canyon: A Different View.''\nThe group received a letter saying a review of records ''did not locate any documents responsive to your request,'' which Mr. Barna confirmed, saying ''there's no real record.''\nJeff Ruch, executive director of PEER, said the Park Service was advancing a particular religious view by keeping the book on sale, and was also deceiving people about it, by repeatedly saying that it would be reviewed.\n''If the question is religious values, they ought at least to be honest about it,'' Mr. Ruch said.\nThe book was assembled by Tom Vail, who operates Canyon Ministries, which offers canyon river tours with a creationist bent.\nThe book maintains that the heavens and the earth were created in six days about 6,000 years ago and that the canyon was formed in a divine flood sent to wipe out ''the wickedness of man.''\nScientists say that earth is billions of years old and that the canyon has been carved over millions of years by the action of the Colorado River.\nIn his statement, Mr. Barna notes that Park Service management policies require reliance on ''the best scientific evidence available'' and, as a result, rangers tell visitors that ''the Colorado River basin has developed in the past 40 million years.''\nBut the guidelines also say that material available from concessionaires in national parks should adhere to the standards used to evaluate Park Service materials.\nWhen the book appeared on Park Service store shelves, there were objections from a host of scientists, including the agency's own geologists, who said it ''repudiates science.''\nIn the interview, Mr. Barna said a new interpretive center would open at the canyon this summer, offering a more detailed explanation of the canyon's development, told in scientific, not religious, terms. He said this investment in science shows where the agency stands.\nBut in an interview yesterday, Mr. Ruch said selling the book was one of a number of efforts to promote the views of fundamentalist Christians in the park, ''not Buddhists or Muslims or anyone else.''\n''This is government establishment of religion in a fairly fundamental way, if you pardon the pun,'' Mr. Ruch said.
1816493	Administrator Is Dismissed From Nuclear Security Post	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E3DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Energy Secretary fired the head of the department's nuclear weapons program on Thursday, citing a series of security failures at national laboratories, including the discovery of a computer device containing thousands of classified documents in the home of a former worker during a drug raid by the police.\nThe official who was dismissed, Linton F. Brooks, had been administrator of the National Nuclear Security Agency since May 2003. The agency was established in 2000 because of chronic security problems in the weapons program.\nThe problems continued during Mr. Brooks's service. On Wednesday, the latest in a string of reports by the Energy Department's inspector general criticizing the agency, dated Nov. 27, 2006, was released.\nDescribing the gaps revealed by the drug raid, in New Mexico, the new report on the Los Alamos laboratory, a center for nuclear weapons research, concluded, ''In a number of key areas, security policy was nonexistent, applied inconsistently, or not followed.''\nEnergy Secretary Samuel Bodman said in a statement on Thursday that lax security ''can have serious implications for the security of the United States.'' Under Mr. Brooks, the agency ''has done its best to address these concerns,'' Mr. Bodman said. But he added, ''I do not believe that progress in correcting these issues has been adequate.''\nMr. Brooks said in a letter to employees that he would leave ''shortly.'' He recounted how the agency was formed to improve security, and acknowledged: ''We have not yet done so in over five years. For much of that time I was in charge of the N.N.S.A.''\nOn Capitol Hill and at the Energy Department, officials said that the department was concerned about oversight hearings planned by the new Democratic leadership of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\nRepresentative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement on Thursday evening, ''While it may be appropriate to begin to address the incessant string of security, safety and management lapses at Department of Energy nuclear weapons facilities with the removal of high-level managers, I am afraid that it will take more than a new boss to fix the problems, which are far more systemic and pervasive in nature.''\nMr. Markey, long a critic of nuclear programs, promised a vigorous inquiry.\nAmong the issues to be investigated was how a computer hacker stole Social Security numbers, birth dates and other sensitive information on 1,500 people at the nuclear weapons agency and why neither those people nor top officials were notified of the problem for nine months.\nAt the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group based in Washington that has issued a series of reports on nuclear security and that first revealed the drug raid, Danielle Brian, the executive director, said, ''We applaud Secretary Bodman's decision to force accountability at N.N.S.A., especially since it has been failing in its mission for years.''\nBut a former subordinate, Gerald E. Marsh, a physicist who recently retired from the Energy Department's Argonne National Laboratory, said he was appalled at the dismissal. Speaking of the weapons complex, Mr. Marsh said, ''I thought he was trying to do what he could to keep a declining operation functioning as well as he could.''\nMr. Brooks was previously deputy administrator for nonproliferation. He was the United States' chief negotiator for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Soviet Union, a role in which he had the rank of ambassador. He is a retired Navy officer.
1816494	More Rhode Island Schools Closed in Disease Outbreak	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E3DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	More than 20,000 Rhode Island students were told Thursday to stay home from school at least until Monday as officials investigate the case of a student hospitalized Wednesday with meningitis.\nThe officials are trying to determine whether that case is related to an encephalitis outbreak last month in which a second grader from Warwick died.\nSchools in Coventry, Warwick and West Warwick were closed early Thursday after officials learned that a student at Hopkins Hill Elementary School here had meningitis. The child is recovering and was expected to be released from the hospital quickly, officials said.\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence closed eight schools in those communities, and Warwick canceled youth activities for Thursday and Friday.\n''Due to similarities with the three other children who had encephalitis, we wanted to take an abundance of caution and recommend the closing of schools while we collect additional information,'' said Dr. David R. Gifford, the state's director of health.\nOfficials are investigating whether the illness was caused by mycoplasma, a common bacteria known as walking pneumonia.\nOfficials said three prior cases of encephalitis, which causes brain swelling and is usually caused by a virus, were rare because they were set off by mycoplasma. One of the three students also had meningitis, officials said.\nCoventry, Warwick and West Warwick are the Rhode Island communities affected. Officials said they have had high rates of children with pneumonia since October. Investigators are looking at links between increased absenteeism and the encephalitis cases in Warwick and West Warwick.\n''We had 20 to 24 cases in one school and 30 in another,'' said the Coventry school superintendent, Kenneth DiPietro.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is looking into a number of causes, including whether a new or virulent strain of mycoplasma has developed, said Dr. Gifford of the state Health Department.\nConnecticut and Massachusetts have sent epidemiologists to assist in the investigation. Neither state has reported similar cases.\nSchool districts throughout Rhode Island are sending letters and e-mail messages home to parents, urging parents and custodians to keep sick children home and listing preventative measures like hand washing and coughing into the elbow, not the hand.\nThe Health Department is asking school nurses to report students with pneumonia immediately, and custodians are washing desks and telephones.\nPediatricians' offices are swamped with calls.\n''We're asking parents to report students who have had strep or pneumonia, to better know if there are any patterns or clusters,'' said Rosemarie K. Kraeger, school superintendent in Middletown.\nThat district surveyed its nurses this week for such cases, Ms. Kraeger said.\nGov. Donald L. Carcieri said he planned an executive order requiring all elementary schools to distribute gel hand sanitizers. The order will include broader measures that are being formulated, Mr. Carcieri said.\nThe governor and Dr. Gifford sought to allay fears at a news conference on Thursday afternoon, assuring the parents that the virus is spread just through coughing and saliva and did not survive well outside the body.\n''Being with someone for a short period of time in an elevator, sporting event, dinner party or playing after school is not how it's transmitted,'' Dr. Gifford said. ''It doesn't live in air-conditioning ducts.''\nParents in Coventry said they were glad that the state was taking extra precautions and closing school.\n''I'm glad they're closed down, so it doesn't spread around,'' said Beverly Baron, whose son Robert is in the eighth grade at Knotty Oak Middle School.\nMs. Baron said she learned of the closing by e-mail.\n''It's enough to scare you,'' she said.\nCindy Naro, 41, who lives next door to Ms. Baron with her sons Christopher, 12, and Nicholas, 9, stayed home from her job-training program to care for her children.\nMs. Naro said she did not know that school was closed until Christopher's bus did not arrive. Ms. Naro said she was worried because Nicholas attends Hopkins Hill and tends to become sick easily, although he has been feeling fine.\n''I told him, 'I don't care if your baby toe hurts, I need to know,' '' Ms. Naro said. ''I have two kids in two different schools. How far is it going to go?''
1816495	Survey Finds Embezzlement In Many Catholic Dioceses	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E2DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	A survey by researchers at Villanova University has found that 85 percent of Roman Catholic dioceses that responded had discovered embezzlement of church money in the last five years, with 11 percent reporting that more than $500,000 had been stolen.\nThe Catholic Church has some of the most rigorous financial guidelines of any denomination, specialists in church ethics said, but the survey found that the guidelines were often ignored in parishes. And when no one is looking, the cash that goes into the collection plate does not always get deposited into the church's bank account.\n''As a faith-based organization, we place a lot of trust in our folks,'' said Chuck Zech, a co-author of the study and director of the Center for the Study of Church Management at Villanova.\n''We think if you work for a church -- you're a volunteer or a priest -- the last thing on your mind is to do something dishonest,'' Mr. Zech said. ''But people are people, and there's a lot of temptation there, and with the cash-based aspect of how churches operate, it's pretty easy.''\nSpecialists in church ethics said they believed this was the first study to assess the extent of embezzlement in a denomination.\nOfficials at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said they had seen the study, which was released just before Christmas and was first reported in the National Catholic Reporter, and were considering ways that parishes could tighten their financial controls.\n''The Villanova study does not come as a surprise,'' said Bishop Dennis M. Schnurr, treasurer of the bishops' conference. ''This is something that the bishops in this country have been looking at for some time. They are aware of a need to look for mechanisms that can assist parishes in accountability and transparency.''\nMr. Zech and his co-author, Robert West, a professor of accounting at Villanova, did not set out to look for embezzlement. They were conducting a study of internal financial controls in Catholic dioceses and sent a battery of questions to chief financial officers in the nation's 174 Catholic dioceses; 78 responded. Mr. Zech said he was surprised that so many dioceses had detected embezzlement. In 93 percent of those cases, police reports were filed.\nHe said the survey did not ask who stole the church money. But it did ask who detected the theft, and found that it was most often the parish priest, followed by the bookkeeper, an internal auditor or the parish finance council.\nIn October alone, three large cases of embezzlement surfaced, including one in Delray Beach, Fla., where two priests spent $8.6 million on trips to Las Vegas, dental work, property taxes and other expenses over four decades.\nIn the survey, 29 percent of the dioceses reported thefts of less than $50,000.\nMost denominations have had cases of embezzlement, sometimes by top officials. In June, the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. fired its second-ranking financial officer, Judy Golliher, after she admitted stealing money that church officials put at more than $132,000.\nMany nonprofit organizations that accept cash donations experience theft, and churches are particularly vulnerable, said John C. Knapp, director of the Southern Institute for Business and Professional Ethics, at Georgia State University in Atlanta.\n''Churches have a tendency to be in denial about the potential for this conduct in their midst,'' Mr. Knapp said. ''When ethics seminars or ethics codes are proposed in churches, they are often met with resistance from people who say, 'Why in the world would we need this? After all, this is the church.' Whereas in business, people readily recognize that this sort of thing can happen.''\nThe Salvation Army is widely considered exemplary among nonprofits in handling cash collections. The red buckets in which bell ringers collect donations are covered and locked, and all buckets must be returned to a central location, where at least two people count the number and type of bills, coins and checks, said Major George Hood, the charity's national spokesman.\nThe money must be deposited in the bank within 24 hours, and different people reconcile the initial tallies with bank records, Major Hood said.\nIn the Catholic Church, parishes and high schools handle many cash transactions, making them vulnerable to theft, the Villanova report notes.\nCanon law requires each parish to have a finance council to provide oversight. But Bishop Schnurr, who heads the diocese in Duluth, Minn., said there were no standards for how finance council members were chosen or whether they should have any expertise in accounting or finance.\nOnly 3 percent of the dioceses said they annually conducted an internal audit of their parishes, and 21 percent said they seldom or never audited parishes, the survey found.\nThis lack of scrutiny is at the core of the problem, said Francis J. Butler, president of Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities, a nonprofit organization independent of the church.\n''You're taking a lot of risk,'' Mr. Butler said, ''and these days the church cannot afford to take these kinds of risks.''\nBishop Schnurr said the study's findings on lack of parish oversight contradicted his experience. But both he and Kenneth W. Korotky, chief financial officer for the bishops' conference, said a committee could soon consider writing guidelines for the composition of parish finance councils and how often dioceses should audit parishes.\nBut they cautioned that the bishops' conference could not make guidelines mandatory, because each bishop was in charge of administering his own diocese.\nJack B. Siegel, a tax lawyer and expert on nonprofit management who has commented on church fraud on his blog, charitygovernance.com, said he kept a tally of church frauds and was surprised by how many occurred at Catholic churches.\n''I got interested because I thought, wait, I've heard a lot about pedophilia, why aren't I hearing about these financial problems,'' Mr. Siegel said.\nHe said he was impressed with the guidelines that the bishops' conference and other Catholic organizations have offered.\nBut he said, ''How those standards and guidelines get put into practice is what really matters.''
1816496	Boy Hangs Himself After Seeing Reports of Hussein's Execution	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E2DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	A 10-year-old boy hanged himself accidentally on New Year's Eve after watching reports of Saddam Hussein's execution, the police and relatives said Thursday.\nFamily members discovered the body of the boy, Sergio Pelico, hanging from his bunk bed and called the police in Webster, between Houston and Galveston.\nThe boy watched television reports on Saturday and asked about the execution, said an uncle, Adolfo Chavez.\n''He asked, 'Is this how they killed people?' '' Mr. Chavez recounted in Spanish. ''We said, 'No, but they did it to this man because he's bad.' ''\nMr. Chavez said his nephew had said nothing more about the hanging.\nThe next night, as adults prepared supper and his cousins played, Sergio went upstairs to his bedroom. Another child found the body, Mr. Chavez said.\nCapt. Thomas Claunch of the Webster police said there was no reason to suspect suicide.\n''It was nothing more than a tragic accident,'' Captain Claunch said. ''I think he was trying to mimic the behavior, and it got out of hand. There were no indications of depression, no problems within the home. He was very positive.''\nThe captain said Sergio, an only child who was in the fifth grade, had given his mother a belated Christmas card. ''In it,'' Captain Claunch said, ''he says he will do better in school this year, that he wants to get her a better Christmas present next year.''\nCaptain Claunch said that the authorities were awaiting autopsy results but that he believed the death would be ruled accidental.\nMr. Chavez said the family would ship the boy's body home to Guatemala for burial.
1816497	Car Seats for Infants Often Fail In Broadside Crashes, Tests Find	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E2DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Car seats for infants often fail to withstand the impact when a vehicle is struck by another from the side, according to laboratory tests conducted by Consumer Reports.\nOf a dozen models tested in simulations of such impacts, 10 failed, some ''disastrously,'' the magazine reports in its February issue.\nThe seats have a base that is installed in the car, and a detachable carrier in which the baby is strapped. In the simulations, the seats often separated from the base and skidded across the laboratory, Consumer Reports said.\nThe seats are rear-facing models of the kind intended for infants up to 1 year old, or about 22 pounds. The government requires manufacturers to test such seats for head-on collisions, but not for broadside crashes, which kill about 30 infants a year in the United States.\nIt is not clear from the tests how many of those deaths could be avoided with better seats: the magazine tested the seats at 38 miles an hour, the speed at which the government tests cars for protection of adults.\nNicole R. Nason, administrator of the government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the agency was working to develop its own infant-seat tests for broadside crashes. ''We need to move faster,'' Ms. Nason said, though adding, ''I do not want parents to be misled into thinking their children are safer in mommy's arms.''\nThe magazine also found flaws in a much acclaimed system, required by the government in all new cars since 2002, that helps anchor baby seats to cars. Indeed, some child seats performed worse with this Latch hardware than when held in place by seat belts. The traffic safety agency said it would hold a public meeting next month to discuss how to improve the Latch system.\nOne seat that failed the magazine's test was the Companion model made by Britax, a product that Consumer Reports, on the basis of frontal impact tests, had previously listed as top-rated. Britax, of Andover, England, sells a better seat in Europe, the magazine said.\nAnother model, the Evenflo Discovery, even failed a head-on test, the magazine said, and should be recalled. But both the Evenflo Company and the traffic safety agency said the Discovery had passed the government's head-on test.\nRobert S. Matteucci, the chief executive of Evenflo, said in a telephone interview that Consumer Reports had so far refused to describe the test method it had used and that small changes in the test could invalidate the results.
1816498	Grief and Many Questions After a Pediatrician's Killing	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E2DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Dr. Leandro Lozada was the kind of pediatrician parents adored. Five days a week, he would leave his comfortable neighborhood here and travel to his private medical practice in a poor section of the Bronx, where he sometimes treated people who had no insurance and occasionally handed out free medication.\n''If I had an emergency at 3 a.m., I would call him and he would meet me in the emergency room,'' said Jacqueline Caceres, whose two children were patients of Dr. Lozada's.\nOn Thursday, Ms. Caceres was one of dozens of parents who stopped by Dr. Lozada's practice to set up a memorial and to grieve.\nAfter he failed to show up at his office on Wednesday, Dr. Lozada, 46, was found dead in his ranch-style home here on the border of Scarsdale a few miles from his practice. The police said they found him lying on the bedroom floor, shot at point-blank range several times, including at least once in the face and once in the back of his head. No murder weapon was found.\nEdmund Hartnett, the Yonkers police commissioner, said on Thursday that there were no signs of a forced entry or of a struggle, leading him to believe that Dr. Lozada knew his killer. Mr. Hartnett said that detectives were also investigating the possibility that a roll of cash had been taken and reports that a sport utility vehicle had been parked in his driveway on Wednesday.\nBut no clear motive has surfaced.\n''We are looking at his business dealings, his financial records and anyone who might benefit from his death,'' Mr. Hartnett said. ''This was not a random act. This individual appeared to be targeted for this crime.''\nAccording to the police, Dr. Lozada spent much of his time at his practice, Hispanic Pediatrics, where he treated poor patients. He had a former wife and two children, a son and a daughter, who lived nearby and a companion who stayed with him occasionally. So far, the police said they had no primary suspect.\nDr. Lozada, a native of the Dominican Republic, earned his medical degree at the University of Santo Domingo about 20 years ago and came to the United States a short time later. About a decade ago, he set up a practice in the Fordham section of the Bronx in a small brick building on a blighted block. Hoping to brighten the street and the building, at 229 East Kingsbridge Road, he painted the facade of the building blue. Parents said he was known for his skill with children and for his commitment to the neighborhood.\n''He was not only a medical doctor, he was a kind-hearted person who cared about where he worked,'' said Christine Reeves, whose grandchildren were patients of Dr. Lozada's.\nIn a personal statement he wrote for his State Department of Health profile, Dr. Lozada said that his goal was to ''give something back to society by serving my community, which is in need of good and culturally sensitive medical care.''\nBut residents of the affluent neighborhood in Yonkers where Dr. Lozada had lived in a rented three-bedroom house for the past year said that he made far less of an impression on them. Steven Seligman, whose house backs up to Dr. Lozada's, said he had met his neighbor only when he moved in.\n''He was neither friendly nor unfriendly,'' Mr. Seligman said.\nDr. Lozada had a daily schedule that he stuck to closely, Mr. Hartnett said. On Wednesday morning, the police said his day began like most others: He awoke early, picked up his daughter at her mother's home, dropped her off at school and then went to his gym.\nWhen he did not show up at work by 10 a.m., his colleagues grew concerned and called his companion. She told the police that she went to the house just before 3 p.m. and found his body.\nOn Thursday, a stream of parents and children paused in front of Dr. Lozada's practice. Mourners cried, lighted white prayer candles, wrote messages in Spanish and English on two posters taped to the brick building, and remembered a doctor they called a caregiver and friend.\nHilaria Pena signed the name of her 4-year-old son, Joshua, on a poster that pictured Dr. Lozada as many patients remembered him: smiling, in white shirtsleeves with a stethoscope slung around his neck and a child in his arms.\n''He was just a good doctor,'' Ms. Pena said.
1816499	Ban on All Political Gifts Is Included in Ethics Reform Proposals by New Jersey Senate Leader	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The president of the New Jersey State Senate on Thursday proposed a ban on all gifts to lawmakers as part of a sweeping package of bills intended to stiffen penalties for ethics violations.\nThe Senate president, Richard J. Codey, said he also planned to introduce measures that would ban political contributions by public entities, step up ethics training for lawmakers and their aides and provide full disclosure for expenditures that are added to the state's budget at the last minute.\nMr. Codey said the measures, which he hoped would pass by the end of the legislative session on July 1, would bolster public confidence in elected officials in a state that has seen more than 200 federal corruption convictions in the past five years.\n''There are certain things we can do,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''We've got to make sure that we're up to speed on these progressive measures.''\nMr. Codey said he did not expect resistance to the measures, largely because each of the 120 seats in the State Legislature is up for election in November and lawmakers will be reluctant to appear soft on public corruption in a state weary of scandal.\nOf the seven bills proposed by Mr. Codey on Thursday, the two most significant concern the acceptance of gifts by lawmakers and increased transparency in the state's budget process. Currently, legislators and their staff members are allowed to accept gifts valued up to $250. Mr. Codey is seeking a complete prohibition on gifts.\nMr. Codey said his proposal for advance notification about 11th-hour budget additions would require lawmakers to submit a written request for changes to the governor's proposed budget 10 to 14 days before the Legislature considers the budget bill.\nSeveral lawmakers called for such a measure last year when more than a quarter billion dollars in expenditures for pet projects were added to the $31 billion budget only hours before it was voted on.\nBefore approving the budget, which ended a seven-day shutdown of state government, Gov. Jon S. Corzine cut more than $51 million of those last-minute additions.\n''Senate President Codey should certainly be commended,'' Mr. Corzine's spokesman, Anthony Coley, said on Thursday. ''He has a partner in Governor Corzine on this.''\nAssembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. also pledged his support and said he hoped the measures would ''help dispel some of the public's skepticism and cynicism about government.''\nAssemblyman Alex DeCroce, the leader of the Republican minority in the Assembly, said many of the proposals mirrored ideas already submitted by Republicans in recent months. ''I hope Senate President Codey will also consider these ideas,'' Mr. DeCroce said.
1816500	The Neediest Cases; For Girl, 3, Every Move Poses Risk Of Injury	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	''I'm O.K.! I'm O.K.,'' Shenay Acheampong, 3, insisted, her little voice slightly croaky from a cold.\nShenay was born with osteogenesis imperfecta Type III, a genetic condition commonly called brittle bone disease.\n''She's very fragile,'' said her mother, Dorcas Acheampong, 28. ''She break easily.'' Shenay is small, with short arms and legs. For her, the most mundane movement is risky; pulling off a snug shirt can snap a bone. Shenay has spent much of her young life in hospitals, where blood pressure cuffs, X-ray procedures and intravenous insertions have all caused breaks and fractures.\n''Any time she goes to the hospital, we have to put a note in her crib,'' said Ms. Acheampong, who estimates that Shenay has worn 50 casts in her 3 years.\nShenay's delicate bones impose a severe limitation on her lively mind. She spends most of her days lying down, too weak to sit up for more than an hour. She looks up at the world with big, bright eyes. "Mentally, everything is O.K., her head, brain and everything," her mother said, and Shenay emphatically agreed.\n''She always needs somebody to talk with because she likes to talk,'' Ms. Acheampong said.\n''She has lots of opinions,'' added Keiko Aizawa, a social worker at New Alternatives for Children Inc. a preventive program that serves families with medically fragile children, including Ms. Acheampong and Shenay. The program is run by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.\nMother and daughter have spent a lot of time in hospitals. Treating Shenay's disease requires calcium infusions every three months. As an infant, it took her a month or more to recover from the infusions. Now it requires a three-day stay at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan.\nWhen Shenay was 7 months old, in October 2003, she had brain surgery, and a shunt was inserted to allow fluid to drain. After the surgery, she had difficulty swallowing and was fed through a tube in her nose for two years, until last October, when a feeding tube was inserted in her stomach, which she prefers.\n''It's hiding, so it's O.K.,'' her mother said. ''She didn't want people to ask questions about the tube.''\nMs. Acheampong was unable to work while caring for Shenay during her preparation for surgery to insert the new feeding tube and then her recovery from it. She fell behind on rent. Neediest Cases was able to help. Ms. Acheampong's monthly rent is $648 for her one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx. She receives $606 in Supplemental Security Income for Shenay each month, and $140 in food stamps. Shenay's medical costs are covered by Medicaid. Ms. Aizawa put $300 of Neediest Cases money toward Ms. Acheampong's rent for December.\nMs. Acheampong had worked as a home health aide and is eager to return to work when her daughter's health allows. ''I had more experience taking care of her. So I can take any case they give me,'' she said.\nShenay is busy learning new things. She practices eating. ''She's trying to feed herself, but she can't do it like a normal baby,'' Ms. Acheampong said. ''She's weak.'' Twice a week Shenay has therapy: speech, physical, occupational and feeding.\nAt the end of November Shenay got a back and leg brace, which Ms. Acheampong and the doctors hope will give her the strength to stand and perhaps someday to walk. ''Right now they just want to start standing her up,'' Ms. Acheampong said.\nShenay started school in the fall at St. Mary's Hospital for Children in Queens, which provides grade level work and access to medical care. She gets there on a school bus three days a week. Even school at a hospital can be hurtful. ''They want me to bring big clothes if I'm bringing her to St. Mary,'' Ms. Acheampong said, so the staff can change Shenay without injuring her.\nMs. Aizawa said that, at New Alternatives, Shenay and her mother have found help and a role model: a 20-year-old woman with the same disease who grew up in the program. ''She goes to Hunter College,'' Ms. Acheampong said. ''She lives in her own apartment. She's in a wheelchair, and she needs lots of help, but she is a very bright woman with a great talent for art.''\nMs. Acheampong said that she and the Hunter College student talk on the phone ''all the time.'' Ms. Acheampong is hopeful that Shenay will be independent. ''I'm hoping that she will be a bright person, a big person,'' she said.\nBut mostly, they focus on today.\n''Mama, I'm itchy,'' Shenay piped.\n''This is the big job we do every day: scratch her hair 24 hours,'' Ms. Acheampong said as she pulled her daughter close and gently scratched the back of her head. Shenay's arms are too short to do it.\nPreviously recorded: $4,647,966.83 Recorded Wednesday: 49,151.00 Total: $4,697,117.83 Last year to date: $5,367,663.05\nHOW TO HELP\nChecks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245, or any of these organizations:\nBROOKLYN BUREAU OF COMMUNITY SERVICE 285 Schermerhorn Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES, DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS 191 Joralemon Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK 1011 First Avenue New York, N.Y. 10022\nCHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nFEDERATION OF PROTESTANT WELFARE AGENCIES 281 Park Avenue South New York, N.Y. 10010\nUJA-FEDERATION OF NEW YORK Church Street Station P.O.

1816502	After Soaring to the Top, Romo Tumbles Back to Earth	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EFDD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Tony Romo and the football have parted ways at such an alarming rate in the past five games that Romo was forced to wear gloves during practice this week.\nDallas Cowboys Coach Bill Parcells was not trying to teach Romo, his quarterback, an old-school lesson on how to protect the ball like he might his wallet. Nor was Parcells attempting to make Romo learn how to throw with a gloved right hand.\nThe Cowboys practiced here with footballs dunked in buckets of water, a simple simulation of the wet conditions they may face Saturday night in Seattle when they play the Seahawks in a first-round National Football Conference playoff game.\nIn a 39-31 loss to the Detroit Lions last Sunday, Dallas continued a recent trend by committing a season-high five fumbles, and losing a season-high three of those. Indeed, Parcells might have ordered wet balls for practice anyway, but the measure takes on a particular urgency for Romo, whose turnovers have mirrored the Cowboys' recent turmoil and prompted his fall from a celebrity grace of sorts.\n''I don't want to discourage his ability to create,'' Parcells said. ''But you have to be aware of the fact you can do more damage than good, and if that ratio gets a little bit high on the damage side, your ability to improvise becomes negated.''\nTwo of the three fumbles lost against the Lions were by Romo, whose daring scrambles and playmaking instincts perhaps saved the Cowboys' season during a 4-1 stretch in his first five games as the starter. He fumbled only twice in that span, threw only two interceptions and earned Pro Bowl honors. He completed 71.3 percent of his passes, threw for 10 touchdowns and was sacked 6 times.\nHis past five games show the flip side of a gambling, mobile quarterback. Romo fumbled seven times and threw eight interceptions as the Cowboys went 2-3 and squandered a two-game lead in the N.F.C. East. He completed 60.5 percent of his passes, threw for 6 touchdowns and was sacked 13 times.\nParcells met with Romo on New Year's Day. The message: Get a grip.\n''He's so confident that he can do things, I think sometimes it affects the judgment,'' Parcells said. ''On certain aspects, when you know you're vulnerable, you have to err on the side of caution.''\nParcells added: ''He was getting away with things. And now he's not getting away with things as much.''\nRomo said: ''That's just the way Bill is. He's a guy who always wants to motivate you. He feels if you ever get to a point where you feel you've arrived in any way, you're not going to work as hard or put forth the same effort.\n''As time goes on, he'll understand that's not the way I am. If anything, I feel the more success you get, you have to live up to it every day, so you have to put more effort in.''\nGiven a choice, Parcells would prefer a watered-down version of Romo as the Cowboys look to win their first playoff game in four attempts since 1996.\n''I don't want to intimate in any way he's the reason we're not playing the way we want to play,'' Parcells said. ''He's part of the reason. We've just got to do a lot of things better.''\nThe Cowboys' defense has contributed to the recent slide, giving up 33 points a game in the past four games. But Romo seems to understand that receiving the brunt of the blame comes with being the quarterback with the third-best efficiency rating in franchise history (95.1) behind Roger Staubach (104.8 in 1971) and Troy Aikman (99.0 in 1993).\n''This is definitely not the time to be doubting him,'' wide receiver Terrell Owens said of Romo.\nOr having his personal life scrutinized. Romo experienced perhaps the true measure of fame -- being rumored to be dating another celebrity, in this case the singer Jessica Simpson, a Dallas-area native. The rumors proved false, but now he has been spotted with Carrie Underwood, the 2005 winner of ''American Idol.'' ''She's just a friend; I don't know where that stuff comes from,'' Romo said of the rumors that they were dating. ''I really can't talk to anyone anymore or say hi without it getting somewhere crazy.''\nRomo, who has talked with Aikman about the perks and pitfalls of being the Cowboys' quarterback, ignores the distractions by immersing himself in football.\n''There's too much talk sometime and not enough just playing and having fun out there,'' he said. ''That part of it sometimes wears on you.''\n''This game isn't rocket science,'' Romo said. ''People always want to point to reasons why a team or a guy is or isn't playing as well. The reality of it is that some weeks, teams do a good job and play well against you. They get a good rush or things like that. It's never that fun stuff people want to write about that makes a good story.''\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816503	Backup Tight End Can Talk the Shockey Talk	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFDD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	There is nothing subtle about Jeremy Shockey. His hair is surfer-dude blond, his arms are emblazoned with tattoos, and he barks at opponents and officials when things do not bounce his way.\nShockey's teammates would not change him one bit.\n''He's our emotional leader,'' center Shaun O'Hara said before practice Thursday. ''Sometimes for good, sometimes for bad. But you know you're going to get the same thing from him every time, and I love him for it. I wouldn't want anybody else out there.''\nThere is a chance the Giants will have to play with the backup tight end Visanthe Shiancoe instead of Shockey in Sunday's wild-card game in Philadelphia. Shockey, who practiced Thursday for the first time since injuring his left ankle against the New Orleans Saints on Dec. 24, was listed as questionable. Coach Tom Coughlin said Shockey was making progress.\nWhen Shiancoe has started in place of Shockey, the Giants' offense has changed considerably. Shiancoe is widely regarded as a blocking tight end; Shockey led the team this season with 66 receptions.\nBut in terms of confidence and self-promotion, Shiancoe and Shockey appear to be on equal footing.\n''Look, man, I'm 6-5, 255 pounds,'' said Shiancoe, who is listed as 6-4 and 250 pounds in the Giants' media guide. ''I run a 4.5. I'm strong as -- excuse me -- hell. So I can basically do anything the coaches tell me to do, and they know that.''\nHe added, ''If Shockey is not able to go, of course I could get 100 yards.''\nThat would be a first. Shiancoe had a career-high 12 catches this season for 81 yards and no touchdowns. He has never caught a pass longer than 17 yards in his career.\nBut Shiancoe might be a better blocker than Shockey, who was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl this season. And he certainly seems to be more durable. Shiancoe has played in every game since being drafted by the Giants in the third round in 2003, while Shockey has missed 11 games in five seasons.\nThe swollen ankle forced Shockey to miss last Saturday's regular-season finale in Washington.\n''I just felt like I couldn't compete as hard as Visanthe Shiancoe and the other guys,'' Shockey said Wednesday when asked about not playing against the Redskins. ''They got an opportunity and they did very well.''\nShiancoe started in Washington and had 1 reception for 8 yards in the Giants' 34-28 victory. Tiki Barber rushed for a club-record 234 yards on 23 carries. Coincidence? Shiancoe said he did not think so, and he may have had a point. The Giants appeared to stick with the running game longer than they would have had Shockey been available.\nThe Giants also did not miss a beat when Shockey was limited by an injured right ankle at the start of the season. They won six of their first eight games with Shiancoe occasionally filling in. With Shockey sidelined in the overtime of the Giants' 30-24 victory in Philadelphia on Sept. 17, Shiancoe wrested away a 9-yard pass from safety Brian Dawkins, sustaining the game-winning drive.\nBut Shockey is clearly a better fit in the offense. When Barber was asked Tuesday about the impact Shockey's absence had in Washington, he said: ''We were forced to run the ball. It hurts our intermediate pass game, and this is not a slight on Shiancoe at all. But he's inexperienced in there.''\nBarber, who ran for touchdowns of 15, 55 and 50 yards against the Redskins, added that Shiancoe was a good blocker.\n''I try to maul people, man,'' Shiancoe said about the subtleties of blocking. ''Tiki's all over the place, man. You don't know where he's going to go. And usually, for some reason, he follows behind me.''\nEven if Shockey is healthy enough to play Sunday, Shiancoe will likely work up a sweat. He started three games in which the Giants opened with dual tight-end sets, and he is a fixture on special teams, playing on most kickoff returns and field-goal attempts.\nBut if Shockey is on the field, Shiancoe's role will be limited at best. Still, he insisted he was not bothered by being overshadowed by Shockey.\n''Everyone thinks that they're starters,'' Shiancoe said. ''Nobody wants their whole career to not be really a strong part of the offense. But it's my role here -- the backup tight end.''\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816504	Senate Feels Heat as House Cranks Up Ethics Overhaul	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EEDD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Unexpectedly broad ethics rule changes that the House passed Thursday are putting new pressure on the Senate.\nThe House rules leave what lobbyists say are ample loopholes for those seeking to buy access to lawmakers, mainly through campaign fund-raising. But leaders of the new Democratic majority in the Senate said Thursday that they were reintroducing a much less extensive package of changes passed last year as the starting place for an intraparty debate next week over how much further the Senate should go.\nSaying they were responding to voter backlash against Congressional corruption that helped them take control, House Democrats went beyond some of the ethics proposals on which they had campaigned.\nThe new House rules bar members from taking gifts, meals or trips paid for by lobbyists, or the organizations that employ them. The rules also ban lawmakers from using corporate jets and reimbursing the owners. A further proposal would also eliminate major loopholes from earlier drafts, in requirements for lawmakers to disclose sponsorship of pet spending projects, or earmarks, and tax breaks they hide in complex legislation.\nThe House Democrats said that in March they would take up the creation of an independent ethics watchdog to police their own conduct, something lawmakers in both chambers had steadfastly resisted.\nIn contrast, the initial Senate ethics bill would ban only gifts or meals and not trips paid for by lobbyists or their employers. It would not restrict the use of corporate jets. It would require disclosure of the sponsors of only a small fraction of spending earmarks, excluding those added to supplementary material, called Congressional reports, that explain legislative intent or that are directed through federal agencies like the Defense Department. Nor does the Senate bill propose any independent enforcement.\nSome senior Democratic aides said the House rules had upped the ante for the Senate.\n''They will be embarrassed'' if they do not do more, said James A. Thurber, a professor of government at American University in Washington and an expert on Congressional ethics rules who has acted as a consultant to several lawmakers. ''When we look at the election, it is a hot issue, so there will be a lot of focus on it in people's minds, and the heat will be on in the Senate.''\nAnnouncing his intention to reintroduce the Senate bill that passed last year, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, promissed to ''improve that legislation and make additional reforms.''\nSenior aides in both parties said Mr. Reid was negotiating with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, to try to work out a bipartisan package of changes. Jim Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said the House actions had no bearing on what the Senate would do.\nAn overhaul is likely to face strong opposition from veteran senators who resent ethics rules as unnecessary, and helped bring back other changes. But aides to the Senate Rules Committee said they were preparing to match the House ban on meals, gifts and trips paid for by lobbyists or any organization that employs them.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Rules Committee, has said she intends to close some of the loopholes in the current bill's earmark disclosure requirements. And despite personal doubts, she has also agreed to hold hearings on creating an independent enforcement watchdog.\nOther Democrats, including Senators Barack Obama of Illinois and Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, planned to push for a far more drastic overhaul.\nThe Feingold-Obama plan would make lawmakers reimburse corporations for use of their jets at the cost of a charter flight instead of the price of a first-class ticket -- a step that stops short of the House rules. The bill would also create an independent watchdog as the House Democrats have discussed. And it would prohibit lobbyists or the organizations that employ them from holding lavish events for lawmakers at party conventions.\nThe Feingold-Obama bill would also require lobbyists to disclose any earmarks they are seeking for their clients, and require lobbyists to disclose any collecting and passing on of campaign contributions -- a practice known as ''bundling'' that currently makes K Street the heart of campaign fund-raising for most lawmakers. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, said she and many other newly elected Democrats were working with Mr. Obama, Mr. Feingold and Mr. Reid to pushing for stronger changes, in part because they felt the resonance of the issue on the campaign trail.\n''The House bill raises the bar,'' Ms. Klobuchar said, ''but a number of senators have already been talking about their own efforts to strengthen the Senate bill.''\nLobbyists, meanwhile, groused that the rules passed in the House would have the unintended consequence of encouraging them to do more fund-raising for House members. The new rules bar lobbyists from treating lawmakers to meals or trips. But the lobbyists can still raise money for lawmakers' campaigns and also join lawmakers at fund-raising events or on overnight trips paid for with those campaign funds. Lobbyists said people seeking access to lawmakers may now have even more incentive to attend fund-raisers because they can no longer simply buy dinner or lunch.\nLawrence W. Noble, a Washington lawyer specializing in political rules, said lobbyists could well feel obliged to attend more fund-raisers. ''We still have a system of private financing of campaigns,'' Mr. Noble said.\nTHE 110TH CONGRESS
1816505	30 Seconds of Fame At Super Bowl XLI Will Cost $2.6 Million	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EEDD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	A MONTH before Super Bowl XLI, it remains unclear which teams will face off on Feb. 4 in Miami. In the other big game that night -- the battle of the Super Bowl advertisers -- the lineup is becoming clearer.\nMore than a dozen marketers have agreed so far to pay an estimated average of $2.6 million -- a record amount -- for each 30-second commercial that will appear during the CBS broadcast of the game.\nAs of this week, CBS has sold about 80 percent of the available advertising time, which totals about 30 minutes. That is a typical commercial load for a Super Bowl.\nAdvertisers will include Super Bowl stalwarts like Anheuser-Busch, FedEx, General Motors and the Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola divisions of PepsiCo. There will also be commercials from recent Super Bowl arrivals like CareerBuilder, Diamond Foods and GoDaddy.\nOther advertisers, including several movie studios, have bought spots but do not want to identify themselves until closer to game time. These companies want to maximize the hoopla they can generate through public relations campaigns and other marketing techniques.\nAt a time when Madison Avenue is anxiously seeking alternatives to traditional selling tactics like TV commercials, it is surprising that demand for Super Bowl spots is as ardent as ever 30 days before kickoff.\nHowever, those involved in making the decisions to spend so much money say they have many good reasons to remain in the game.\nFor one, as audiences split among a seemingly infinite number of media choices, the Super Bowl is almost always the most-watched TV event of the year -- and it is almost always watched live, commercials and all, rather than on a delayed playback using digital video recorders that can zip through the spots.\nAlso, Super Bowl marketing has been rapidly evolving to add nontraditional methods to reach consumers. For example, computer users can watch the commercials online after the game on Web sites like aol.com, video.google.com, video.yahoo.com and youtube.com.\nAnd consumers are being invited to enter contests to create Super Bowl spots as part of a trend known as user-generated content. At least three advertisers are sponsoring such contests during Super Bowl XLI: the Chevrolet division of General Motors, the Doritos brand sold by Frito-Lay and the National Football League.\n''There is no other platform quite like the Super Bowl,'' said Robert Lachky, executive vice president for global industry development and chief creative officer at the Anheuser-Busch beer division of Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis.\nFor several years, Anheuser-Busch has bought the most commercial time of any Super Bowl advertiser, about five minutes in each game. The company will maintain that ranking again, planning to run 10 spots for three brands it brews -- Budweiser, Bud Light and Bud Select -- and one it imports, probably Grolsch from the Netherlands.\n''It's worth it,'' Mr. Lachky said of the cost. ''When you can touch that many households, that many adults, in one sitting, it's actually efficient.''\nBeing the game's biggest sponsor also works for Anheuser-Busch from a timing standpoint, Mr. Lachky said, because the next day the company intends to introduce a significant advertising initiative, an online entertainment network called Bud.TV that will be on a Web site with the bud.tv address.\nBud.TV will feature all the Anheuser-Busch commercials seen during during the game, Mr. Lachky said, along with content like video clips, sports programs and talk shows.\n''We will definitely be 'popping' Bud.TV via one of our billboards,'' Mr. Lachky said, referring to the moments during the game when brand logos are superimposed on screen as an announcer lists the sponsors.\nAnheuser-Busch spends weeks each year testing batches of would-be Super Bowl spots before deciding on the final lineups. Sometimes, decisions are not made until the day before the game.\nThe Grolsch commercial being considered for the Super Bowl is being created by the St. Louis office of Momentum, owned by the Interpublic Group. The spots under consideration for the Bud brands are being created, Mr. Lachky said, by Cannonball in St. Louis and three agencies that are part of the Omnicom Group: the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, Downtown Partners in Toronto and Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco.\nGoodby, Silverstein could be a Super Bowl double-dipper. A humorous 30-second spot it is producing for the Emerald brand of snack nuts sold by Diamond Foods will run in the third quarter. This will be the third consecutive year for Emerald as a Super Bowl advertiser.\n''The Super Bowl is an event, an event that lives on,'' said Andrew Burke, vice president for marketing at Diamond in Stockton, Calif. ''It's about the next day, when people in their office say to each other, 'Did you see that guy in that Super Bowl commercial?' ''\nHoping to include Emerald in that chatter, the commercial created by Goodby, Silverstein will be ''a little bit different, a little bit irreverent,'' Mr. Burke promised, featuring the singer and actor Robert Goulet in an offbeat performance.\nTo generate additional attention, Mr. Burke said, there will be video clips on a Web site, promotions, signs in stores and coupons.\nGoDaddy, which registers Web site names, will be back for a third straight year. The company will run one or two commercials that will represent the first work from its new agency, the Shine Advertising Company in Madison, Wis.\nCurt Hanke, account director at Shine, said yesterday that he would not be able to discuss the campaign for a week or two. In the 2005 and 2006 Super Bowls, GoDaddy ran risqué commercials that raised some eyebrows; the reactions to the spots were described in copious detail on a blog written by the GoDaddy president, Bob Parsons.\nThe estimated average price tag for each 30-second commercial in the game, at $2.6 million, is slightly ahead of the estimated average cost for each spot during Super Bowl XL, which was $2.5 million.\nThe sales activity is ''pacing very close to where we were at this time three years ago'' when CBS last broadcast a Super Bowl, said JoAnn Ross, president for network sales at CBS in New York, part of the CBS Corporation.\n''We're getting there,'' she added, referring to the eventual goal of being sold out. ''We're not wringing our hands or gritting our teeth.''\nThe steps the network is taking to stir up Super Bowl excitement will include a special, ''Super Bowl's Greatest Commercials 2007,'' to be broadcast on Feb. 2, Ms. Ross said. CBS is also exploring the idea of offering Super Bowl sponsors the opportunity to make their spots available online on the CBS SportsLine Web site (cbssportsline.com).\nADVERTISING
1816506	Distributor's Bankruptcy Rattles Book Industry	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EEDD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Book publishers braced themselves for a financial blow this week after a bankruptcy filing by Advanced Marketing Services, a book distributor.\nThe company filed for bankruptcy protection last Friday, reporting more than $200 million in debt to dozens of publishing companies. Its creditors included publishers large and small, among them Random House, which is owed $43.3 million, and Good Books of Intercourse, Pa.., which specializes in books about the Amish and the Mennonites and is owed nearly $1 million.\nA publishing executive said that while authors and readers were unlikely to be affected by the bankruptcy filing, many publishers might not recover much of what they were owed.\n''This is a huge disruption in this business,'' said the executive, who declined to be further identified because he was not authorized to speak for his company. ''The publishers are going to end up taking a big loss.''\nAccording to the bankruptcy filing, Advanced Marketing Services has been looking for additional financing or a buyer for the last 18 months, enlisting the investment bank Jeffries & Company in the search.\nAdvanced Marketing Services also owns Publishers Group West, a distributor for a consortium of publishers including Grove/Atlantic, which may be hit hardest by the bankruptcy filing.\n''It's a mess,'' said Morgan Entrekin, the publisher of Grove/Atlantic, adding that he had been meeting with lawyers for days and was scrambling, trying to figure out how to deal with the situation.\nAdvanced Marketing Services was granted $75 million of debtor-in-possession financing by creditors so it could continue to function for the next several months.\nSimon & Schuster immediately suspended shipments to Advanced Marketing Services, a Simon & Schuster spokesman, Adam Roth-berg, said.\nPublishers would not give details on their business relationships with Advanced Marketing Services, but the company accounts for as much as 10 percent of some publishers' sales.\n''We're exploring ways to keep working with them,'' a spokeswoman for HarperCollins, Erin Crum, said. A spokesman for Random House declined to comment.\nThe bankruptcy filing came over the New Year's weekend, catching many publishing executives by surprise. The book industry is largely shut down the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, and some executives were still trickling back to work late this week.\nAdvanced Marketing Services, founded in 1982, has headquarters in San Diego. It acts as a middleman between publishers and booksellers, obtaining books directly from the publishers and distributing them to retailers like Sam's Club, Costco and BJ's Wholesale Club. The company operates three distribution centers, in Indianapolis; Hanover, Md.; and Woodland, Calif.\nAdvanced Marketing Services' financial difficulties were widely known in the industry, after an accounting scandal in 2003 resulted in the ouster of several senior managers. A lawyer for the company did not return calls seeking comment.\nThe distributor has near-exclusive access to the discount retailers known as price clubs, including Costco and Sam's Club. The price clubs can produce lucrative returns for the right books, like cookbooks and mass-market reading, and can allow publishers to reach people who do not shop at bookstores.\nBooks are a relatively small part of the price clubs' total business, but they have one attribute that retailers love: the suggested retail price is printed directly on the book jacket. Because the books are then discounted by at least 20 or 30 percent, this promotes the feeling among buyers that the stores are offering them a bargain.
1816507	2 Law Firms Call Off Plans For a Merger	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402EEDD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	One of the biggest proposed law firm mergers of the last year has been called off, the victim of too many insurmountable issues.\nThe two firms, Dewey Ballantine and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, announced the news yesterday. The two had been in talks since last fall to join their specialties in mergers and acquisitions and debt financing. The new firm would have been one of the nation's largest legal advisers, with 1,500 lawyers based in New York and San Francisco.\nUnlike most merger talks, which are conducted in secrecy, the firms announced in October that their top committees had given preliminary approval to the proposal. At every step in the process after that, the firms expressed confidence that the deal would go through.\nThe two had already decided upon the name Dewey Orrick for the combined firm. Dewey's chairman, Morton A. Pierce, and Orrick's chairman, Ralph H. Baxter Jr., would have served as co-chairmen, with Mr. Baxter taking on the additional title of presiding partner.\nPartners were to have voted on the deal last month. But as several obstacles proved intractable, those elections were postponed to this month.\n''While both firms tried their best to work through these challenges, we were unable to bring the merger to completion,'' the two firms said in a statement. ''No one issue led us to this point.''\nAmong the most visible distress signals was the departure of 10 partners from Dewey since merger talks began. Most ominous were the exits of three lawyers from Dewey's mergers and acquisitions team, including Michael J. Aiello and Jack S. Bodner, who had been considered protégés of Mr. Pierce.\nPeople familiar with the negotiations said the talks had continued as recently as last weekend.\nThe chairmen of both firms said in interviews that the decision to part ways was mutual.\n''We reached a point where we decided it was in the best interest of both organizations to go our separate ways,'' Mr. Pierce said.\nBoth chairmen said that they would look for future growth opportunities, but that neither was looking for another merger partner right now.\n''When you look at how law firms grow, while mergers have great advantages, it's the statistically least likely way to do it,'' Mr. Baxter said.\nUnlike mergers in other sectors, law firm consolidation involves the joining of companies whose main assets are their people. Orrick is acquainted with such situations, having undertaken merger talks with several firms in recent years, including Coudert Brothers in 2005 and Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine in the late 1990s. None of those talks came to fruition, though Orrick subsequently hired lawyers from those firms.\nThe dilution of brand names, unclear lines of authority and unfunded pensions are among some of the issues that may have played a role in the talks' demise, said Peter Zeughauser, a law firm consultant who did not work on the deal.\nUnfunded pensions have long been a concern in the merger of law firms because partners inevitably bristle at taking a pay cut to help new colleagues' retirement plans. Several consultants and lawyers at other firms previously questioned whether Dewey's unfunded pension system would pose problems for the deal.\n''It's not at all uncommon for an unfunded retirement plan to be a deal breaker,'' Mr. Zeughauser said.\nA person familiar with the negotiations also pointed to questions over management authority. Though the deal had been labeled a merger of equals, it was clear that Orrick would retain control over crucial matters, the person said.\nBoth Dewey and Orrick have long histories. Dewey is a storied New York adviser whose name comes from Gov. Thomas E. Dewey. Orrick is one of San Francisco's oldest law firms, founded in 1863.\nBoth have prominent corporate deal-making and litigation practices. Dewey, a 550-lawyer firm, is known as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions, having advised on major deals like the hospital operator HCA's $33 billion leveraged buyout. And Orrick, with more than 950 lawyers, is considered a leader in debt financing and capital market transactions and restructurings.\nLast year proved profitable for the two firms, with both claiming profits of about $1.4 million per equity partner. Dewey earned $408 million in gross revenue and Orrick pulled in $666 million for the 2006 fiscal year, both showing improvement over 2005.
1816508	Second-Largest Tribune Company Shareholder Hires Buyout Consultant	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEEDD1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The McCormick Tribune Foundation, the second-largest shareholder in the Tribune Company, said yesterday that it had hired a buyout firm to advise it on a course of action while the Tribune Company is on the block.\nThe foundation's five directors are all current or former members of the Tribune Company management and could influence the company's decision whether to sell some or all of its assets. The foundation and the company said they had taken steps to avoid any conflicts of interest.\nA person close to the process said bids for the company were due Jan. 17. Its assets include The Los Angeles Times, 10 other newspapers, two dozen television stations and the Chicago Cubs.\nJoseph A. Hays, a spokesman for the foundation, said it had hired the Blackstone Group buyout firm as part of its fiduciary responsibilities because 75 percent of the value of the foundation is in Tribune stock. Blackstone is to review the company's financial information and advise it on a course of action.\n''It's a full range of opportunities, from standing pat to divesting stock to acquiring stock, and in between there is infinity,'' Mr. Hays said.\nThe McCormack Foundation, founded at the death of Col. Robert R. McCormick in 1955, finances an array of charities. It has an 11.7 percent stake in Tribune. The Cantigny Foundation, which is associated with the McCormick Foundation and owns 1.4 percent of the shares, has joined in retaining Blackstone.\nTribune's biggest shareholder is the Chandler family, which owns 20 percent and has expressed interest in buying the company.\nThe foundation said it had set up a special advisory committee of two of its five board members to direct Blackstone's work. Those two -- James C. Dowdle and John W. Madigan -- are retired Tribune executives. The other three are current members of the Tribune Company management: Dennis FitzSimons, chairman and chief executive; Scott C. Smith, president of Tribune publishing; and David Hiller, publisher of The Los Angeles Times. Colonel McCormick stipulated in his will that the foundation's directors be current or former officers of the Tribune Company, but that has raised questions of potential conflicts of interest.\nDaniel Borochoff, president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, a watchdog group in Chicago, said it was not clear where the board's interests began and the company's interests left off. He said it was unusual for a foundation to have so much of its assets invested in one company. He also questioned whether only two of the five directors could decide the foundation's course of action, given that they do not constitute a majority.\nIn a regulatory filing yesterday, the foundation said that the three current executives ''have been isolated from this process on behalf of the foundation,'' referring to the potential sale of Tribune. In addition, Mr. FitzSimons sent an internal note to employees saying, ''Given our role as current officers of the company, Scott, David and I have voluntarily recused ourselves from any deliberations regarding alternatives'' for the foundation's investment in the Tribune Company.\nMr. Hays said that Mr. Madigan owned stock in Tribune and that Mr. Dowdle did not. He said Mr. Madigan's stock ownership did not pose a conflict because ''his interests are aligned with the foundation.''\nUntil recently, Mr. Madigan was a special partner at Madison Dearborn, a private equity firm that is considering a bid for Tribune; the firm said yesterday he had left to avoid any appearance of a conflict.\nLate in the day, the foundation said it was receiving so many questions about its intentions in establishing an advisory committee that it issued a statement saying the move ''should in no way be construed as a reflection on the management of Tribune Company.'' The committee, it said, ''continues to have complete confidence in Tribune Company management.''\nAs a philanthropic organization, the foundation could not make a bid itself for Tribune because it has no cash. But it could participate in a deal with a private equity firm or another company. ''This is where a financial adviser would be helpful,'' a person close to the process said.\nThe Chandlers started the process that led to the auction of the Tribune Company when they expressed displeasure last year at the company's slumping stock price and said management was muddled. The Tribune Company said it would examine its strategic options, including the sale of part or all of its assets.\nCorrection: January 6, 2007, Saturday A picture caption in Business Day yesterday about a decision by the McCormick Tribune Foundation, a large shareholder in the Tribune Company, to hire the Blackstone Group as an adviser while the Tribune is up for sale, misstated the role of the company's chief executive, Dennis FitzSimons, in the sales process. Mr. FitzSimons, who is also chairman of the foundation's board, has recused himself from issues regarding the sale; he is not a member of the special committee dealing with the Blackstone Group.

1816510	The Year That Made Deal Makers Giddy	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E7DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	For deal makers, does it get any better than this?\nA heady cocktail of rapidly growing emerging markets, floods of private equity and hedge fund money, buoyant chief executive confidence and a hungry debt market that seems willing to snap up nearly everything that banks can dish out has created an environment so fertile that mergers in 2006 surpassed all records.\nGlobally, there were $3.79 trillion worth of deals last year, up 38 percent from 2005, according to data from Thomson Financial.\nDeals were even up 11 percent from the heights of 2000, the year of the AOL-Time Warner merger that has come to symbolize the dangers of a mergers and acquisitions bubble. Many of the deals of that year left a hangover of bad debt and broken companies.\nRecords were also broken last year for hostile deals and European deals. Dealogic, a competing statistics firm, says that 2006 deal flow was even higher, at $3.98 trillion.\nGavin MacDonald, head of European mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, acknowledged that he had ''seen a few cycles'' in more than 20 years as a banker, but never one like this.\n''We thought in 2000 we might not see its like again, but we've surpassed even that,'' he said.\nNo one can agree on what happens next.\nSteven A. Baronoff, the global head of mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch, said, ''The question a lot of people are asking themselves is, 'Last time it ended relatively badly, so will we see the same kind of problems in the future?' ''\nMany bankers, perhaps not surprisingly, insist the answer is no. After all, deals during this boom have been happening throughout many industries, not concentrated in just telecommunications and new media as they were in 2000. They are being financed by fast-growing cash flows and forgiving capital markets, not overpriced stock.\n''This time around it is a very different environment,'' Mr. Baronoff said. ''It's a much more balanced boom.''\nAnd although deal volume is up, the prices that companies are paying are still well below what they were in 2000, said David Kirshenbaum, chief operating officer for global mergers and acquisitions at Citigroup.\n''We're seeing lower premiums and much higher identifiable synergies, and a positive reaction from the stock market,'' he said.\nOthers, however, see a slowdown in deals coming this year.\nPhil Isherwood, an equity strategist with Dresdner Kleinwort, said to ''prepare for a peak in 2007.'' One of the symptoms, he said, is the prevalence of cash deals. Through mid-December, some 70 percent of announced mergers were cash instead of stock, he said, compared with a 10-year average of 40 percent.\n''This use of cash is a symbol and symptom of a bubble, not an argument against it,'' he said.\nToo much money is chasing too few deals, driving up prices, Mr. Isherwood said. ''Bigger deals, bigger borrowing and bigger prices equals bigger risk, not bigger fun.''\nIndeed, the ever-bigger buyouts of 2006 have raised concerns about the amount of debt used to do the deal.\n''Given current leverage levels and recent developments in the economic/credit cycle, the default of a large private equity backed company or a cluster of smaller private equity backed companies seems inevitable.'' the Financial Services Authority, the British markets regulator, said in a November report.\nPrivate equity buyers accounted for nearly a fifth of all deals in 2006, according to Thomson. The volume of these deals doubled in the United States in 2006, as they aggressively outbid corporate buyers.\nFor example, a group including Blackstone and the Texas Pacific Group bought the medical device company Biomet for $10.9 billion last month, snatching it from the jaws of a larger rival, Smith & Nephew of Britain, which had courted the company for months.\nTo win the day, they are taking out larger and larger loans. Over all, $183.3 billion in high-yield debt was issued in 2006, according to Thomson, up 52 percent from a year before.\nThe key to keeping the merger mania going is liquidity -- or the willingness of banks to lend money. So far, the door has been wide open for most borrowers, thanks in part to the exponential growth of new products like credit derivatives and credit default swaps, which allow lenders lay off some of the risk to other buyers. That door, of course, could slam shut if a deal goes sour, predict bankers and investors.\nBut so far, there is no sign the party is ending: Private equity funds raised about $400 billion in 2006, and as of December had about $700 billion available to do deals. Morgan Stanley predicts that 2007 will bring even more large leveraged buyouts, including some huge European deals in the $25 billion to $35 billion range.\nIf there is a slowdown on the horizon, many bankers predict it will not happen until at least the second half of the year.\n''You've seen a lot of activity in the fourth quarter, and that is a good harbinger for the first half of 2007,'' Mr. Kirshenbaum of Citigroup said.\nThere will continue to be a lot of activity in buyouts, emerging markets, and in Japan and the Middle East, he added.\nNew market participants are adding to the trend, helping to smooth the way for hostile deal makers.\n''Hedge funds have become the kingmakers,'' deciding at what price they will sell out, Mr. MacDonald of Morgan Stanley said.\nChief executives can no longer rebuff takeover offers easily, because once one is made, their stock is often snapped up by hedge funds looking for a quick buck. This impact has been keenly felt in Europe, where such investors helped Mittal Steel take over a reluctant Arcelor, and may be pushing the London Stock Exchange into the hands of Nasdaq.\nThat may not be the case in 2007, though. ''The hedge funds have a lot of money, but it is yet unclear that they are getting great returns out of this,'' Mr. Baronoff of Merrill Lynch said. ''If they find other higher return activities, maybe they will focus a little less on activism,'' he said.\nYet as Michael Tory, head of British investment banking at Lehman Brothers, said: ''As long as the liquidity is there and the sources of liquidity remain healthy, there is no reason this can't continue.''\nSTREET SCENE\nCorrection: January 11, 2007, Thursday A chart on the Street Scene page of Business Day last Thursday that listed the leading merger and acquisition advisers misstated the value of the deals in 2006. For Goldman, Sachs, the sector leader, it was $1.088 trillion, not $108.8 trillion. For the industry as a whole, the value of the deals was $3.805 trillion, not $380.5 trillion.

1816511	Rise in Ethanol Raises Concerns About Corn as a Food	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E7DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Renewing concerns about whether there will be enough corn to support the demand for both fuel and food, a new study has found that ethanol plants could use as much as half of America's corn crop next year.\nDozens of new ethanol plants are being built by farmers and investors in a furious gold rush, spurred by a call last year from the Bush administration and politicians from farm states to produce more renewable fuels to curb America's reliance on oil. But the new study by the Earth Policy Institute, an environmental group, found that the number of ethanol plants coming on line has been underreported by more than 25 percent by both the Agriculture Department and the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry's main lobbying group.\nThe Earth Policy Institute says that 79 ethanol plants are under construction, which would more than double ethanol production capacity to 11 billion gallons by 2008. Yet late last month, the Renewable Fuels Association said there were 62 plants under construction.\nThe lower tally has led to an underestimate of the grain that would be needed for ethanol, clouding the debate over the priorities of allocating corn for food and fuel, said Lester R. Brown, who has written more than a dozen books on environmental issues and is the president of the Earth Policy Institute. ''This unprecedented diversion of corn to fuel production will affect food prices everywhere,'' Mr. Brown said.\nBob Dinneen, the president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the group had not intentionally tried to play down the number of plants under construction. ''It has been a moving target,'' Mr. Dinneen said in an interview on Thursday. ''We are not trying to hide the ball. We are trying to keep up with a growing and dynamic industry as best we can.''\nThe Renewable Fuels Association has generally played down concerns in the food versus fuel debate over ethanol, saying that estimates showed there would be plenty of corn to meet the demand for both. ''We can absolutely do that without having a deleterious impact on consumer food prices,'' Mr. Dinneen said.\nThe National Corn Growers Association said Thursday that farmers were keeping up, noting that growers produced their third-largest crop in 2006 of 10.7 billion bushels. ''All demands for corn -- food, feed, fuel and exports -- are being met,'' Rick Tolman, chief executive of the corn growers, said in a statement. ''Farmers have always responded to price signals from the marketplace and, historically, we have had much more challenge with overproduction than shortage.''\nWith spot prices of corn soaring to record highs of nearly $4 a bushel last month, farmers are expected to plant some 85 million acres of corn this year, an increase of 8 percent over 2006 and what would be the largest corn-seeding in the country since 1985, said Dan Basse, president of AgResource, an agricultural research company in Chicago.\nEthanol has raised the incomes of farmers and given new hope to flagging rural economies. But the reliance on corn to produce ethanol in the United States has drawn concerns from some economists, who question whether the drive to corn-based fuel will push up the prices of livestock and retail prices of meat, poultry and dairy products.\nMr. Brown is among those who believe the ethanol industry is growing too quickly. He called for a federal moratorium on the licensing of new distilleries. ''We need a time out, a chance to catch our breath and decide how much corn can be used for ethanol without raising food prices,'' he said Thursday.\nLike many other experts, he advocates moving past corn-based ethanol into cellulosic ethanol, produced from plant waste and nonfood crops like switch grass.\nFor now, however, in the anticipation of high potential returns, ethanol plants that rely on corn are being built by everyone from farmers to Bill Gates of Microsoft to a mix of Wall Street investors. In addition to the 116 ethanol plants in production, and the 79 under construction, at least 200 more ethanol plants, with a capacity of 3 billion gallons a year, are in the planning stages.\nIn all, ethanol distilleries now running or in the works will pull an estimated 139 million tons of corn from the 2008 corn harvest, according to the Earth Policy Institute. That is about double the demand projected by the Agriculture Department and will require over half of the projected 2008 corn harvest of about 11 billion bushels.\nKeith Collins, the Agriculture Department's chief economist, did not respond to requests for comment. One reason for the department's projection of just 60 million tons of corn used for ethanol is that it was released last February, before surging oil prices set off investor interest in ethanol plants. The Agriculture Department will release its new projections next month.\nBut the pace of plant construction may be slowing. Shortages of galvanized steel and backlogs for special tanks for the distilleries have pushed construction time back from 18 months to as much as 28 months for some plants, Mr. Basse said.\nSome towns are also demanding environmental studies to better understand the impact ethanol plants can have on water supplies and quality of the groundwater, which has delayed permits for new processing plants.
1816512	Saying the No. 1 Ranking Is Worth Keeping, G.M.'s Chief Vows to Fight Toyota	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	General Motors is not ready to concede its position as the world's largest automaker, the chief executive, Rick Wagoner, said Thursday, but he offered scant evidence that the company could fend off a challenge from Toyota, its Japanese rival.\n''I like being No. 1,'' Mr. Wagoner said, ''and I think our people take pride in that, so it's not something that we're going to sit back and let somebody else pass us by.'' But in an hourlong discussion with reporters, Mr. Wagoner said G.M. was not ready to project how many vehicles it would sell this year. Two weeks ago, Toyota set a global sales goal of 9.34 million for 2007, about 3 percent more than the 9.1 million vehicles that G.M. sold worldwide in 2006.\nMr. Wagoner noted that G.M.'s plants were capable of building more vehicles than Toyota intended to sell, but he added that output was going to depend on whether sales were strong in geographic regions where G.M. had available capacity.\nHe said G.M., which has been the largest carmaker since 1931, expects to increase sales this year in several regions outside the United States, particularly China, Russia and South America.\nMr. Wagoner spoke on the same day that the chief executive of another Detroit automaker, Thomas W. LaSorda of the Chrysler Group, announced a goal of doubling sales outside North America within five years.\nMr. Wagoner did not offer any such predictions, and he gave no indication that G.M. would fare significantly better in the United States in 2007 than in 2006, when its market share fell to 24.3 percent from 26 percent. In that period, Toyota's share climbed to 15.4 percent, from 13.3 percent, according to the Autodata Corporation, the industry statistics company in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.\nIn December, G.M.'s sales in the United States fell nearly 10 percent, worse than analysts had anticipated, while Toyota's rose about 17 percent. American dealerships accounted for about 45 percent of G.M.'s global sales in 2006.\nIf anything, analysts expect G.M. to sell fewer vehicles in much of the world this year, as it reduces production capacity by closing plants. Mr. Wagoner said the closings were meant to ensure G.M.'s long-term success.\n''If, as a result of that, we get passed, well it won't be a happy day for me, but I've lost basketball games before in my life,'' said Mr. Wagoner, who played basketball for Duke University. ''You get ready, you learn and you go back and play the next day.''\nHe went on, ''We're going to fight to keep the position and if one day we lose it, we'll fight to get it back.''\nJeff Manning, president of the United Automobile Workers local union in Kansas City, Kan., where 3,000 G.M. workers build the Saturn Aura and Chevrolet Malibu, said falling behind Toyota would be a disappointment, though palatable if necessary for G.M. to stop losing money.\n''Being No. 1 is a top priority, but is it the No. 1 priority? Probably not,'' Mr. Manning said. ''If it makes them profitable then that would probably be O.K. The No. 1 goal is to be profitable.''\nFord's Plans in Brazil\nSÃO PAULO, Brazil, Jan. 4 (Reuters) -- Ford Motor said on Thursday it would invest $1.02 billion in Brazil through 2011, including the amount it would pay for the off-road vehicle maker Troller.\nFord, which has been suffering financial problems, did not say how much it would pay for Troller.\nBased in the northeastern state of Ceara, Troller produces about 100 vehicles each month in two off-road models: the T4 jeep and a pickup called the Pantanal. The company said in November that it was in talks to sell to Ford.\nFord said the investments would be in addition to about $139 million it planned to spend on product development and capacity expansion at a plant in São Paulo State.
1816513	Bloomberg Is Playing Down Expectations for Convention	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E6DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	With a decision from the Democratic National Committee on where it will hold its 2008 presidential nominating convention on the horizon, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appeared to dampen expectations yesterday that the party would choose New York over Denver, the other city still in contention.\nReferring to Denver as the city ''which everybody says is the odds-on favorite,'' Mr. Bloomberg emphasized the difficulty of raising enough money to cover the costs of playing host to the convention, sounding very much like a man reluctant to win his own bid.\n''The risks that we might have been willing to run four years ago probably aren't prudent to run today -- we just don't have to do that,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference in Brooklyn, referring to the successful effort to land the 2004 Republican National Convention in the aftermath of the 2001 terror attack, when the city's economic health was in question. ''Every convention, we welcome them here, whether it's for politics or commercial, but we're just not in the business of paying for it.''\nAfter the Republicans chose Minneapolis-St. Paul for their 2008 convention, the Democrats said they would make their selection before the end of last year, but decided to negotiate complete agreements with both competing cities before making that choice. As that process appeared to be coming to a close in December, both efforts hit snags. A crucial labor union in Denver refused to sign a pledge banning strikes during the convention, and Mr. Bloomberg in New York continued to raise alarms about the cost.\nHoward Dean, the party chairman, decided to wait until January to announce the convention city.\nNow, with Denver's labor situation still unsettled, Democratic officials appear no closer to a final decision, although Mr. Bloomberg's most recent comments seem aimed at lowering expectations that the convention would come East.\n''I have no idea what they're going to do,'' Mr. Bloomberg told reporters, referring to Democratic officials. ''As I said, we'd love to have them, but I don't think the city can put itself on the line in this day and age to guarantee'' the $80 million to $100 million needed for such a convention.
1816514	A Downstate Deal Maker as Driven as His Boss	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E6DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	BLUNT to the cusp of brusque, Patrick J. Foye, the mergers-and-acquisitions specialist recruited by a long- ago law firm colleague, Eliot Spitzer, to run the downstate portion of the Empire State Development Corporation, is barking into his cellphone in the driveway of his unostentatious home -- a much-remodeled ranch with three nondescript vehicles outside -- in one of Sands Point's less sandy neighborhoods. No streetlights, no sidewalks, no stoplights: except for Mr. Foye and his loud conversation, this wealthy community on Long Island's North Shore is pin-drop territory.\nThe topic being discussed, just before the December holidays, is a business deal in the final, sensitive stages of gestation. The ear on the other end of the phone belongs to a reporter whom Mr. Foye doesn't know but whom he wishes to dissuade from a premature story that might adversely affect the deal. He barks again. He listens intently (the mark, he says later, of a highly trained debater, which he has been since high school in Queens). He signs off without ultimatums: ''Just call before you make a final decision. Thanks.'' Click. He gives his beard an absent-minded tug. And no, he won't share the specifics of the chat.\nHe had not, officially, made the segue from his position as chief executive of the United Way of Long Island (a reclamation project of sorts) to his co-chairmanship of the development corporation, a job he accepted instantly over an egg-whites breakfast with Mr. Spitzer, then the governor-elect, in November, but was already adding his clout to the cause. If you agree to work for a crusader, says Mr. Foye, 49, whose job in the Spitzer administration began this week, you'd better be ready to be one.\n''We're going to do projects that generate the highest fiscal and social return to the state and its taxpayers; we're committed to moving forward on the redevelopment of Penn Station and West 34th Street, Atlantic Yards and the revitalization of ground zero, and to other deals throughout the state,'' he says, marching into the dining room after exchanging a monosyllabic greeting with his wife, Suzanne. It appears that Mr. Foye is routinely brief, if affable, with everybody, his three daughters included.\n''How are you?'' he asks the oldest, 17. ''I'm sick,'' she says. ''So why are you still going to get a haircut?'' he asks. She shrugs and leaves with her mother, but not before Mr. Foye, wearing a whimsical red tie sprinkled with tiny gray clouds, hollers a quick question at his wife: ''Suzanne, what would you call our decorating style? Cluttered?'' She nods. Her most obvious contribution is Christmas knickknacks and two decorated trees.\nHis are on the walls, with the overstock crammed in a niche by the fireplace. Mr. Foye collects World War I bond posters insatiably; the pride and joy of his collection is an original rendition of Uncle Sam's ''I Want You,'' circa 1917, purchased for $500, which he estimates is now worth $10,000. ''It's the buy of a lifetime,'' he says, pragmatic even about aesthetics.\nHE bought his first poster in 1981 after graduating from Fordham Law School and joining Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Its theme, ''Buy Early,'' struck him as appropriate for a beginner mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer. He became a partner in 1989, and early on worked alongside Eliot and Silda Wall Spitzer, whom he describes as respected colleagues rather than close pals.\n''He's a better lawyer than me, and she's better than both of us,'' Mr. Foye remarks. ''This is going to sound toadyish, but what he did as attorney general was a masterpiece of lawyering in the vision he had about how that office could be used. As governor, he's totally focused on making life better for the people of New York.''\nTo help Mr. Spitzer do that, Mr. Foye, the son of Irish immigrants (his father was an elevator operator, doorman and union leader; his mother, a waitress) and the first in his family to graduate from high school and attend college (on a union scholarship), will have to be adept at squeezing dollars. Mr. Spitzer's budget emphasizes limited spending with no tax increases; his specific advice to Mr. Foye: be a tough deal maker and a nonpartisan decision maker.\n''Eliot's mandate is for the agency to become more effective and strategic in developing the economy of the state and to make great strides without spending additional dollars,'' says Mr. Foye, apparently comfortable with the notion of doing more with less. It's similar to the message he preached at United Way, where he spent three years righting the books and reconfiguring the mission.\n''It had lost direction, management was tired, and it had lost the confidence of opinion makers,'' he says of the agency. He took a job there in 2004 after leaving a lucrative vice presidency with Aimco, a real estate investment trust, because he chose not to relocate his family to Denver.\nHis own fiscal conservatism, he says, is evident in the antistatus cars in the driveway. His idea of having a blast is beer, bagpipes and an annual St. Patrick's Day party in the backyard.\n''Work is where you trade your time for making money, and money allows you to use your time in ways you choose.'' The Foyes choose travel when he's not working. Mr. Foye, a registered independent who was appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki as deputy chairman of the Long Island Power Authority in 1995, switched from law to business because ''businesspeople are decision makers, capital allocators, and leaders -- and the hours for business folks are better, too.''\nAnd the hours for public servants? Ask his new boss.\nPUBLIC LIVES
1816515	High-Tech Gadgets in Taxis Will Cut Profits, Cabbies Say	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE6DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	A plan to provide high-tech enhancements to New York taxicabs -- including touch-screen monitors that will allow passengers to watch television, get game scores and track their ride on a global positioning system -- drew angry reactions from cabdrivers yesterday who say they will have to foot the bill.\nMore than a dozen drivers squeezed into a cramped City Council hearing room yesterday to protest the high-tech amenities they will soon be required to install in their vehicles under new city guidelines. The Taxi and Limousine Commission, which regulates city cabdrivers, says the cost of installing and operating the equipment will range from $2,900 to $7,200 per taxi over a three-year period.\nThe plan also requires drivers to accept credit and debit cards. Drivers say the 3.5 percent transaction fee that they would pay would eat into their profits, and that if the card system is down, they could get stuck with the cab fare if the passenger is without cash.\n''We're independent contractors, we're like entrepreneurs, and we're forced to take credit cards,'' said William Lindauer, 63, who said he had driven a cab in the city for 30 years. ''You can't force a restaurant to take credit cards. And entertainment, we're forced to provide entertainment?''\nMr. Lindauer was one of several drivers to testify before the Council's Transportation Committee, which is evaluating the costs and benefits of the new technology.\nCommission officials defended the enhancements. The changes stem from a 2004 compromise in which medallion taxicabs -- the yellow cabs regulated by the city -- were allowed to raise fares by 26 percent in exchange for installing several technological improvements to improve customer service.\n''These customer service improvements are delivering on a promise that we made to taxi riders almost three years ago, and represent a leap ahead of anything currently being offered to passengers anywhere in the taxi world,'' Matthew W. Daus, chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, said in a statement after yesterday's hearing.\nMany of the drivers at the hearing were members of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents about 7,000 drivers in the city. At least a few raised the possibility of a strike if the changes are fully instituted.\nDrivers say the required global positioning system and automated system that records a trip could lead to an invasion of their privacy. But commission officials say the only data they would collect would be a trip's beginning and end. The commission also said the 3.5 percent credit card fees negotiated with the credit card companies is substantially less than what cab owners pay to accept credit cards.\nMore than 3,000 cabs accept credit cards around the city, paying about 5 percent per transaction plus a weekly fee of $8 to $12, according to the commission. Commission officials and vendors say allowing customers to pay with credit and debit cards will increase driver profits.\nThe city began rolling out the first of 200 taxis to be outfitted with the new equipment last month as part of a test. So far, though, only 28 cabs have been fully equipped, according to Andrew Salkin, the first deputy commissioner of the Taxi and Limousine Commission.\nThe commission expects that all 13,000 medallion cabs in the city will have the equipment installed by the end of 2007.\nThe commission has signed deals with four vendors to provide the equipment and operate the services. Each will provide different offerings for customers.\nThe system allows passengers to get information on dining and events around the city, get the latest news and scores, watch movie trailers and choose their own music. They can also get information on their driver and fares and, as is mandated for all the systems, watch as their ride is tracked by a global positioning system along a map. The system also includes advertisements, which the vendors say will eventually cut down on the monthly fees charged to the cab owners.\nEd Sloam, president of TaxiTech, one of the four vendors, said that 76 percent of customers who tested the system in a commission survey loved the system. Those who do not like it can turn it off, he said.\n''Taxis in the city are finally coming into the 21st century,'' Mr. Sloam told committee members yesterday.\nCity Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer of Manhattan, who opposes the enhancements, said passengers should not be subjected to a barrage of advertising.\n''I never want to see this, and I promise you no real West Sider wants to see this,'' she said.
1816516	Irish Look for Answers After Another Bowl Loss	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E5DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	It is a predictable crowd taunt whenever a highly anticipated matchup disintegrates into a blowout. So, in the closing moments of Louisiana State's 41-14 thumping of Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl Wednesday night, the Tigers' gold-and-purple-clad fans chanted, ''Over-rated,'' in full throat at a broken Fighting Irish team.\nIn the bowels of the Superdome early Thursday morning, Notre Dame Coach Charlie Weis dared not dispute them. His team had looked downright puny in giving up 577 yards to L.S.U. and setting a record in futility that is not exactly welcomed in the hallowed halls beneath Notre Dame's golden dome.\nThe Irish had just surpassed South Carolina (1945 to 1988) and West Virginia (1987 to 1998) in the N.C.A.A. record books by losing their ninth bowl game in a row. What Weis and his star senior quarterback, Brady Quinn, had hoped would be another milestone in the renaissance of a storied football program was instead a stark reminder of how far Notre Dame has to go.\nOn paper, Weis's 19-6 record and back-to-back appearances in Bowl Championship Series games may look like a promising start. But he knows better.\nFour elite teams have taken turns thumping his Irish: Ohio State in last year's Fiesta Bowl, Michigan and Southern California this season, and L.S.U. here. Those teams averaged 41.5 points and 484.5 offensive yards against Notre Dame.\n''I think the first thing that's got to happen is that everyone is thinking the same way I'm thinking,'' an obviously disappointed Weis said. ''They can't be content to be 10-3 and going to a bowl game and getting your clocks cleaned. That's my responsibility. It would be really easy for me to sit here and blame the players, but I would be at fault.\n''We've got to turn the corner because right now we've got a nice, solid team. You want to be an upper-echelon team, not a nice, solid team, and a team competing for national championships. That just won't cut it with how this ended.''\nHow the Sugar Bowl ended was especially cruel to Quinn, who was harassed into a subpar performance by the Tigers' big and fast defense: 15-of-35 passing for 148 yards, with two touchdowns and two interceptions. He will leave Notre Dame with 36 team passing records after starting for most of his four years, a turbulent time in which the coach who recruited him, Tyrone Willingham, was fired and replaced by the blunt and hard-nosed Weis.\nQuinn, who finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting this season, was on the sideline in the closing moments Wednesday night, when his L.S.U. counterpart, JaMarcus Russell, left the field to a thunderous standing ovation.\nRussell, a rock-solid 6-foot-6, 260-pound junior who may have played his last collegiate game, dissected Notre Dame's outmanned defense with laser-like bombs and pinpoint touch passes to wide-open receivers. He completed 21 of 34 passes for 332 yards, threw for two touchdowns and ran for another score.\n''Russell's a hard man to bring down on those sprint draws,'' the Notre Dame senior safety Tom Zbikowski said. ''They had a lot of weapons and used them all.''\nL.S.U. Coach Les Miles, who has led the Tigers to consecutive 11-2 seasons, was puzzled by the way Russell seemed to fly under the public's radar despite being the nation's third-most efficient passer. Heisman voters may have missed him, but N.F.L. executives have not. Some project him to be a first-round pick, perhaps the No. 1 selection.\nRegarding Russell's immediate future, Miles said: ''He's got to make a very difficult decision. If he returns, he'll certainly be a Heisman Trophy candidate.''\nWhile Weis must replace Quinn, he also knows he has to do a lot more, particularly in recruiting. Willingham did not leave him much, according to recruiting analysts who said he struggled to attract blue-chip prospects to South Bend, Ind.\nLast year, in Weis's first focused period for finding players, he brought in a recruiting class ranked in the top 10 in the nation, according to several recruiting services. If Notre Dame's current verbal commitments hold up, including one from the nation's top quarterback prospect, Jimmy Clausen from California, the incoming recruiting class may crack the top 5.\nBefore the Sugar Bowl, Weis acknowledged that no amount of coaching acumen could make up for bigger, faster and more skilled players.\n''If we're going to get to the top and stay there,'' he said, ''recruiting is the constant.''\nBut after his team was shellacked by another superior opponent, Weis cautioned that returning Notre Dame to the top level of college football, and banishing the ''over-rated'' chants for good, may take some time.\n''We came here the first year and made some good strides,'' he said. ''But I don't think we made enough strides for me to be content. We need to make some more steps if you want to play for it all.''\nFOOTBALL
1816517	Playing With a Gleam in His Eye	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E5DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Gilbert Arenas turns 25 tomorrow and his Washington Wizards teammates thought that buying him a hibachi would be appropriate, though perhaps not very useful.\n''Nah, Gil doesn't cook,'' his teammate Antawn Jamison said. ''The only time Gil's cooking is out there on the basketball court.''\nWhich is precisely why Arenas shouts his signature ''Hibachi!'' after nearly every basket he makes, borrowing a phrase that his teammate Brendan Haywood first coined.\nNobody in the N.B.A. was sizzling more than Arenas in December. He averaged 34 points a game, including a 60-point night against Kobe Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers, a feat that earned him player of the month recognition.\nAnd then Wednesday night, at home, Arenas punctuated his play with a stunning 32-foot buzzer-beater that broke a tie score and gave the Wizards a 108-105 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. He did not shout ''Hibachi'' or even ''Guaranteed, yea-ah!'' or ''Let's make it hot-aaah'' -- his other slogans these days.\nArenas, a 6-foot-4 guard, did not have to; he knew the shot was good. He simply turned around and walked to the Wizards' bench before it even dropped. For once, his drama was in the understatement.\nWelcome to Arenas Live, the hottest show in the N.B.A., and a show that is not always about basketball.\n''Most of the stars, they're not entertainers,'' Arenas said in an interview in Washington on Tuesday after a Wizards practice. Referring to Heat center Shaquille O'Neal, he said: ''When I was growing up, that's what I loved about Shaq. I want to be like that, fun-loving. I think everyone takes things too serious. For some reason, I look around, it's like, we're not grateful for what we get and what we are.''\nArenas is indeed very grateful for his success, but he is also a little resentful about being drafted in the second round in 2001 after playing college ball in Arizona. Feeling disrespected, he uses every slight -- real or perceived -- as motivation.\n''In my mind, I arrived a long time ago,'' said Arenas, whose jersey number is zero. ''It's just convincing everybody else that I arrived.''\nIn the same interview Tuesday, Arenas called himself a ''character,'' but said that compared to Michael Jordan, Bryant or Allen Iverson, he was ''normal.''\nHe wants to be lighthearted, but he scored 54 points in an overtime victory against Phoenix on Dec. 23 after vowing to exact revenge on Suns Coach Mike D'Antoni, who was an assistant coach on the United States national team from which an injured Arenas was the last player cut in August.\nIt is these types of contradictions that define Arenas.\n''He loves the game of basketball, but don't let the fun fool the fact that he's an assassin,'' the Wizards' president, Ernie Grunfeld, said in an interview Wednesday. ''He loves to win, he loves to compete, and he's an unbelievably hard worker.''\nArenas has paced the soaring Wizards (18-13) to an average of 107.7 points a game, second only to the Suns. After a slow November in which his team went 5-9, Arenas hit his groove by scoring 60 points in his hometown of Los Angeles on Dec. 17, pacing the Southeast Division-leading Wizards' to a 147-141 overtime victory. He shot 17 of 32 from the field and 21 of 27 from the free-throw line, prompting Bryant to criticize Arenas for having ''no conscience'' by throwing up so many shots.\nArenas took the high road. And then he doubled back.\n''Truthfully, it's hard to go at somebody who's the best player in the league,'' Arenas said. But he went on to suggest that Bryant should follow his lead, engage in more charity efforts and boost his image.\nWhen it comes to charity, Arenas has developed his own niche. He always tosses his No. 0 game jersey to a fan after the final buzzer. He plans to give away 20,000 jerseys at a game later this season.\n''How does Kobe get his mojo back?'' Arenas said he asked his teammate Caron Butler recently. ''If he gave out 20,000 jerseys of that number 24, oh man, L.A. would eat it up because of how powerful he is. But he doesn't do it.''\nArenas said he wants to fulfill a larger purpose in the community. ''I don't want to be the superstar they latch onto, I want to be the person they latch onto,'' he said.\nArenas's teammates cannot help but be drawn to his talent, especially after he has, by the team's count, nailed eight jump shots to end a quarter, half or game this season. Six of the eight have been 3-pointers.\n''Gilbert has a unique amount of swag out on the court,'' Jamison said after Wednesday's game. ''The guy has been playing like this all year. He has been unbelievable.''\nOff the court, his teammates have grown to appreciate his quirky, obsessive behavior.\n''I think he understands when to press and when not to press and when to just be Gilbert,'' Jamison said. ''That's something in the past he had, but he didn't know how to use it. Sometimes you may not agree, but he definitely tries to help out his teammates.''\nButler has never been an All-Star, but he is now posting career numbers worthy of All-Star consideration, benefiting from the attention opposing teams pay Arenas. And Arenas gets an assist for the December coach of the month honor won by the Wizards' Eddie Jordan.\n''It's clear he means so much to us, the way he approaches the games, the way he gets through games when he's focused and efficient,'' Jordan said.\nStill, Jordan said that Arenas has not yet achieved elite status. ''He's shown that he's going in the right direction as a scorer,'' Jordan said, before adding that he wants him to improve his defense and be more consistent and focused in practice.\nBut Jordan cannot help but enjoy Arenas for who he is, from the zero on his uniform to the personality within the player.\nArenas chose his number to signify that he came from nothing as a child, when he and his father, an aspiring actor, survived by precarious means in Los Angeles.\nNow, fans are wearing the number and showing up with hibachi signs. Last season, Arenas finished with the fourth-highest scoring average in the N.B.A., at 29.3 points a game. Bryant was first, Iverson second and LeBron James third.\nThis season, he is averaging 30.3 points, third behind Iverson and Carmelo Anthony. ''I think it's opened up people's minds,'' Arenas said of his consistency. ''They can look my way and see what I've done in the past is not a fluke. What I've done in this league I deserve because I've actually worked for it.''\nIn the 2003-4 season, his first in Washington, Arenas tried to vote himself into the All-Star Game, trading two pairs of shoes and a jersey in exchange for a box of ballots at a local athletic shoe store. But he did not make the team until 2005, as a reserve, and was a late replacement to the East squad last season.\nDwyane Wade and Vince Carter lead this season's fan voting for Eastern Conference guards; Arenas, who was third in the balloting results released on Dec. 28, said he would probably vote for Carter, although he added that he was more deserving.\nHis true fan base extends to the Internet, where Arenas has been offering drills and advice to high school players via his MySpace page. ''It's like every kid who got cut, or the coach passed him up, they all come to me,'' he said.\nTonight, friends and celebrities will gather to honor his birthday. Arenas is paying for a black-tie, invitation-only party at a Washington nightclub. Sean Combs will be the host; various rap stars will perform.\n''How many players can say, 'Hey, I threw a party and I had Puffy host it?' '' said Arenas, who does not plan to take the microphone to address his guests. ''I'm shy,'' he said.\nButler said, ''He's shy until he gets comfortable, and then once he gets comfortable, he'll steal the show.''\nBASKETBALL
1816518	For Knicks' Lee, Benchwarmer's Seat Is Usually Cool	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	David Lee leads the Knicks in rebounds and field-goal percentage, converts free throws at a better rate than Stephon Marbury and averages more assists than Nate Robinson.\nThe box scores indicate that Lee, a second-year forward, is making an impact. But statistics fail to properly define Lee's value, and there is no clever formula or high-tech abacus sophisticated enough to capture it.\nIt is better simply to watch Lee on any possession -- a video highlight being worth a thousand statistics.\nConsider a sequence from Wednesday's 99-81 rout of Portland: The Blazers have cut the Knicks' lead to 9 points in the third quarter. The Knicks' Jared Jeffries misfires badly on a 3-pointer, and Lee grabs the rebound. He passes back to Jeffries, whose layup is blocked by Joel Przybilla. Lee comes up with the ball again and feeds it to a wide-open Eddy Curry, who hits an easy layup for a 61-50 lead.\nAfter Portland cuts the lead to 9 points again, Marbury misses a 3-pointer and an 8-foot jumper on the same possession. Lee grabs the second rebound, hits a layup and draws a foul for a 3-point play. The lead is back to 70-58 and never dips into single digits again.\nLee had 14 rebounds in the game (6 on offense) and 4 assists -- all solid numbers, yet still not as impressive as the actual plays that produced them. Lee's rapid ascension, from semi-obscure 2005 draft pick to indispensable role player, has been one of the few highlights of the season.\nIt has also put Coach Isiah Thomas in the awkward position of having to constantly justify Lee's spot in the rotation. Lee can play all three frontcourt positions and has been far more productive than the starting forwards, Channing Frye and Jeffries. But Thomas has used Lee off the bench in 23 of 35 games, starting him only when others are injured.\nThomas is asked about Lee's role at least once a week. It is a topic of discussion among Knicks fans. It is even the topic of a poll on the Web site ultimateknicks.com, under the heading, ''Petition to start David Lee.'' (Thirty-two of 39 respondents clicked ''Start him now. What is the holdup?'').\nThe answer from Thomas has been consistent. He views Lee as an ideal sixth man, a player whose energy and rebounding can start a rally and alter the game's dynamics. He can come in at center if Curry is in foul trouble, at power forward if Frye is missing shots and at small forward if Jeffries is out of sorts, which was the case for much of this road trip.\nDespite his reserve status, Lee consistently plays more minutes than Frye or Jeffries. Thomas did not hesitate to remove Jeffries quickly during the Knicks' losses at Phoenix and Sacramento, sending in Lee each time.\n''David's playing extremely well, and when you got a guy who's playing as well as he is right now, you don't necessarily have as much patience as you normally would have with someone who's playing in front of him,'' Thomas said.\nIn that regard, Lee's value extends beyond his play. He is also the guy Thomas turns to to remind his starters that their jobs and playing time are not guaranteed.\n''It's great to have him in that position, because he keeps everybody honest out there,'' Thomas said. ''You can send him in for any of the frontcourt guys. So they all know he's sitting there waiting to come in. He's to the big guys what Vinnie Johnson was to Joe Dumars and I.''\nIt helps that Lee's production remains fairly constant, regardless of whether he starts (12.7 points, 11.7 rebounds) or comes off the bench (9.7 points, 10.2 rebounds). For the season, Lee is averaging 10.7 points and 10.7 rebounds (seventh in the league).\nOn a 48-minute basis, Lee averages 17 rebounds, tied for third in the league with Denver's Marcus Camby. With 3.8 offensive rebounds a game, Lee ranks second in the N.B.A., behind Chicago's Ben Wallace (3.9). Lee is the only reserve among the top 20 rebounders.\nLee is not one to make an issue of his reserve role, especially since Frye is one of his best friends. It would perhaps be impolitic, as well, for Thomas to start Lee, the 30th pick in the 2005 draft, over Frye, the eighth pick.\nThomas regards Lee and Jeffries as similar players -- they rebound, they defend and they have no jump shot. ''I think they're both the same offensive threat, which is not much,'' Thomas said with a laugh.\nThere is an important distinction, however, and it is evident in Lee's shooting percentage (.615, second in the league). Whereas Jeffries has trouble finishing around the basket, Lee can score in traffic and through contact.\nOther general managers regard Lee as one of the Knicks' most marketable commodities (because he is also young and relatively inexpensive). John Hollinger, the author and stat-crunching columnist for ESPN.com, placed Lee among the most improved players in the league, based on Hollinger's player-efficiency ratings formula.\nAs a rookie, Lee showed all of the same abilities, but he was often lost in Coach Larry Brown's befuddling rotation. The only thing Lee has lost now is his obscurity.\nREBOUNDS\nQuentin Richardson is expected to participate in the Knicks' shoot-around Friday morning and will be a game-time decision for their game against the SuperSonics. He has missed 10 games because of back spasms. Nate Robinson will serve the 10th and final game of his suspension Friday night, missing the chance to play in his hometown.\nBASKETBALL
1816519	At Least The Hero Was on Time	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E4DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The year may be young, but it is not too early to nominate the No. 1 feel-good story of 2007. Somebody is going to have to work awfully hard to outdo Wesley Autrey, a true hero in a city where the word ''hero'' is overworked to the point of losing all meaning.\nUnless you're just back from Neptune, you will recognize Mr. Autrey as the construction worker who jumped from a subway platform to save a film student who had suffered a seizure and fallen to the tracks at 137th Street and Broadway. Mr. Autrey shoved the student into a trough between the rails and held him there as a No. 1 train rolled over them -- catastrophe mere inches away.\nYou can't make up stories this good, or come up with a more appealing hero than this 50-year-old workingman. He went to City Hall yesterday, with his two young daughters, to be honored by the mayor. The word ''hero,'' even ''superhero,'' hung in the air, thick as a morning fog. Mr. Autrey was having none of it.\n''Superhero, superhero,'' he said, almost mocking the word. ''I don't feel like a superhero.''\n''I just did it,'' he said, ''because I saw someone in distress.''\nMaybe so. It is safe to say, though, that precious few of us would dream of doing what he did. The odds are far greater that we would end up like the film student, Cameron Hollopeter, 20. Not that we would necessarily tumble onto the tracks. But falling ill in the subway? It happens all the time.\nIn fact, ''sick customer,'' to use the official lingo, is a major reason for train delays, hundreds of them every month.\nFrom January to October 2006, to cite the most recent statistics available from New York City Transit, queasy riders needing medical attention were responsible for 3,969 delays. The figure for October alone was an unusually high 743. Only track work (14,076 delays) and signal problems (7,567) caused more train backups during that period.\nSubway rules demand that conductors stay with ailing riders until help arrives, typically in the form of emergency medical technicians based at Grand Central, Times Square, Queensboro Plaza and other well-trafficked stations. Given that requirement, train delays are inevitable.\nWhat makes riders sick? The reasons are many.\nAn article this week in AM New York, a free newspaper handed out at subway entrances, blamed poor nutrition, especially among dieting young women. It quoted a subway E.M.T. who spoke of appearance-obsessed women skipping meals, sometimes for days. In the subway, they become light-headed and faint.\nThat idea was not endorsed by Paul J. Fleuranges, a spokesman for New York City Transit. Then again, it was not dismissed, either. ''Officially, we don't know why people are ill,'' Mr. Fleuranges said.\nFrankly, we can see why many New Yorkers, men or women, might want to diet simply to fit into subway seats. Some of the made-in-Japan cars seem designed for made-in-Japan rumps, not New Yorkers' wider beams. You want to talk about trans fats? Try transit fat.\nOn the No. 1 line, where Mr. Autrey performed his heroics, the contoured seats are 17 inches wide. Your average New Yorker is appreciably wider. As a result, you routinely see seven riders -- and often only six -- filling up space that in theory should seat eight. Should this winter ever turn truly cold, the many Michelin Man jackets will make for an even tighter squeeze.\nEven if excessive dieting does not really explain why so many people fall ill, the fact remains that health problems keep trains from running as smoothly as everyone would like. Sick customers account for appreciably more delays than either track fires or -- one of our favorites -- riders' holding train doors and keeping them from closing.\nInterestingly, the category of ''suspicious package'' is relatively low among the causes for delays: No. 22 on the list. It accounted for 860 delays in the first 10 months of 2006.\nThat number ''is nothing to sneeze at,'' Mr. Fleuranges said, but it is well below what it was a year or two earlier, soon after the terrorist bombings on commuter trains in Madrid and London. Rider wariness, Mr. Fleuranges said, ''really does change with the tenor of the times.''\nNaturally, transit officials still want people to stay on guard. ''If you see something, say something'' continues to be the slogan.\nBut Mr. Autrey kicked it up several notches, didn't he? By leaping to the tracks to save a life, he effectively told New Yorkers: ''If you see something, do something.''\nNYC E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com
1816520	For Democrats, a Choice: Forward or Reverse?	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E4DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Democrats realized their political and legislative dream Thursday. Now they must face reality.\nAs they take control of the House and Senate, members of the new majority must reconcile diverse ideological factions within their ranks and make a fundamental choice. They can spend their energy trying to reverse what they see as the flaws of the Bush administration and a dozen years in which conservative philosophy dominated Congress. Or they can accept the rightward tilt of that period and grudgingly concede that big tax cuts, deregulation, restrictions on abortion and other Republican-inspired changes are now a permanent part of the legislative framework.\nThe competing drives were on display amid the constitutional hoopla Thursday and the emotion surrounding Representative Nancy Pelosi's election as speaker, a position filled until now by the likes of Sam Rayburn, Joseph Cannon and Nicholas Longworth -- men whose names adorn nearby House office buildings. ''We have broken the marble ceiling,'' Mrs. Pelosi said after she was handed the gavel.\nIn a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus earlier in the day, Mrs. Pelosi made her own allusions to the competing tugs on Democrats, noting the party was rooted in its traditions but not hostage to the past. She promised a new direction ''for all the people, not just the privileged few,'' a reflection of the leadership's political and policy calculation that Democrats need to champion the average guy.\n''The agenda we have is about restoring economic security to a very vulnerable middle class,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the Democratic Caucus. ''The real activity will be in those areas.''\nYet many Democrats contend that President Bush and the Republican-led Congress that was his partner moved the dial too far to the right in many cases. And they believe it will be the work of Democrats to make a significant course correction.\n''I think there are a lot of things the people of America want changed,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a tough critic of some Bush policies.\nMr. Leahy and others made clear that the new direction had to begin with American policy in Iraq.\nBut their domestic legislative agenda suggests that they are picking selected fights rather than going for wholesale change. On the economy, they will move swiftly to increase the minimum wage. On social policy, they will challenge Mr. Bush by calling for expanded stem cell research. They will try to pass legislation increasing college aid for the middle class. All of those issues have the twin advantages of broad popular appeal tied to measurable economic impact on individuals.\nBut Democrats are in no rush to engage in a fight with Mr. Bush over the ideological centerpiece of his domestic policy, his tax cuts. And they have showed no inclination to wade back into the abortion issue, despite its potency among many of their supporters.\n''We have to keep our eye on the average American family and sort of push aside the interest groups left, right and center,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''The world has changed, and it demands new solutions, not the old Democrat and Republican nostrums.''\nBut there is no dispute that Mr. Bush's legislative and executive record will get a microscopic examination via a renewed emphasis on oversight, a Congressional function Democrats say was all but abandoned in recent years. And the results of those inquiries could determine what policies Democrats try to unravel if they uncover a strong case against them.\n''The Bush administration has passed an entire architecture of laws that are going to be reviewed,'' said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, one of the most liberal members of the House.\nRepublicans are waiting to see what develops, uncertain if Democrats sincerely want to join hands and produce some consensus on public policy. Or, as one senior Republican asked, will Democrats hostile to the Bush administration be more like the scorpion in the fable with the frog, unable to resist the urge to sting even if they hurt themselves?\nDemocrats acknowledge that with their minuscule majority in the Senate and one in the House that is not much larger, they lack the political muscle to go too far in reversing Bush policy even if that was their chief goal. And they already have their hands full with delivering on their own ambitious legislative agenda, following through on their pledges of bipartisanship and ethics overhaul and avoiding anything that costs the party its chance at the White House in 2008.\nLeading Democrats say their best direction is forward, concentrating on establishing a new party legacy rather than obsessing with the perceived failings of Republican rule. The test for the party's newly empowered leadership and the Congressional membership will be whether they can stick to that path.\nTHE 110TH CONGRESS: NEWS ANALYSIS
1816521	Smiles, Backslaps, Even a Civility Meeting: For a Day, at Least, Bipartisanship Reigns	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E4DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Capitol Hill observed a National Day of Comity on Thursday. Against the sober backdrop of war and as Democrats ascended in both chambers, people of both parties spoke of how committed they were to working together and changing the political tone.\nAnd how many times have we heard that before?\n''Almost on an annual basis,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, a three-decade veteran of civility vows in the capital. ''It's like our New Year's ritual around here.''\nBut maybe this time really will be different. Like 63-degree weather in January (and cherry blossoms out of season), Washington seemed to have flipped on its head, power-wise, karma-wise, at least for a few hours.\nThere were children and flowers everywhere, and pictures of Vice President Dick Cheney and Senator Edward M. Kennedy mugging together.\nAnd a warm-looking handshake between the only Muslim in Congress, the newly elected Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, and Representative Virgil H. Goode Jr., a Virginia Republican who had condemned Mr. Ellison's plan to use the Koran at his ceremonial swearing-in. (Mr. Ellison made history in more ways than one at that ceremony Thursday by using a Koran once owned by Thomas Jefferson.)\nAnd dapper old senators saying things like this:\n''The place is like a bubbling bottle of Champagne, overflowing with joy and hope and civility,'' said Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia. And to think, this guy is in the minority now.\nO.K., so maybe the venerable Mr. Warner was exaggerating a bit. Or indulging in a smidge of sarcasm. But his words and the big smile with which he delivered them neatly captured the spirit of the day.\nThe Senate's top leaders, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, convened a bipartisan meeting at 9 a.m. to discuss bipartisanship.\n''I'm here for the civility meeting,'' declared one freshman, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, as she stepped out of an aide's Honda outside the Capitol. She pretended to fuss with her hair, as if this were the first day of school and she was nervous. An upper classman, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, sat in an idling Cadillac a few feet away.\nNearly all senators showed up for the civility meeting, which was held in the plush and ornate Old Senate Chamber. They left the doors open for several extra minutes so the photographers could come in to take pictures of the smiles and shoulder squeezes and hugs all around.\nAfter a few minutes, the meeting reverted to the slightly awkward feel of a junior high school mixer, with the boys and girls (or Ds and Rs) repairing to separate sides of the room. There were a few exceptions, as when Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, took a seat next to Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, after working both sides of the chamber.\nAt the very least, no one was alleged to have acted in an uncivil manner.\n''Of course not,'' reported Senator John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, shocked -- shocked -- that anyone could even suggest such a thing.\n''People want us to stop acting like kindergarten kids,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee.\nIt was an open question as to how long this era of good feeling would last.\n''What time is it?'' Senator Claire McCaskill, a newly elected Democrat from Missouri, asked just before noon. ''It's still early yet.''\nNot two minutes later, Senator Jim Bunning was asked a question -- shouted a question, actually -- about this latest of calls for civility.\n''We hear them every year,'' Mr. Bunning, a second-term Republican from Kentucky, said before storming off, uncivilly.\nBut that was the exception Thursday, as was the seemingly unhinged man who had apparently not gotten the comity memo and interrupted a television interview in the Russell Office Building, shouting profanity as he headed out the door with the Capitol police right behind him.\nBack on the House side, fresh-faced Representative Patrick Murphy, Democrat of Pennsylvania, was clutching his 6-week-old daughter, Maggie, and talking about how he had choked up when taking the oath a little earlier.\nAn Army veteran who served in Iraq, Mr. Murphy said his mind had flashed to his time in the service, the oath he took there. And he nearly teared up again as he rubbed the soft cheeks of Maggie, who was sucking on a ''Daddy's Little Girl'' pacifier.\n''It seems pretty collegial here,'' said Mr. Murphy, basing his assessment on exactly 90 minutes in the House and on his orientation soon after the election, where a fellow newbie gave up his seat so Mr. Murphy's wife, Jennifer, then very pregnant, could sit down.\n''He was a Republican,'' Mr. Murphy recalled. If only he could remember the nice man's name. ''I think he might have been from Florida.''\nPut it down as a baby step on the comity journey.\nTHE 110TH CONGRESS
1816522	Subway Rescuer Receives The City's Highest Award	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Not the weighty medal from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the all-expense-paid trip to Disney World, the year's worth of free subway rides, the $10,000 waiting for him from Donald Trump -- not even the popping flashbulbs and the barrage of questions from a throng of reporters at City Hall yesterday could sway Wesley Autrey, now known as the Subway Hero, from his central message: If you see something, do something.\n''Good things happen when you do good,'' Mr. Autrey said after the mayor gave him the Bronze Medallion, the city's highest award for exceptional citizenship and outstanding achievement. The award, for jumping onto the tracks at the 137th Street station of the No. 1 line on Tuesday to help Cameron Hollopeter, 20, a film student who had fallen off the platform after having a seizure, puts Mr. Autrey in the company of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Muhammad Ali and Willie Mays.\n''I'm not looking at this like I'm the hero,'' said Mr. Autrey, 50, who stood with his daughters, Shuqui, 6, and Syshe, 4. ''The real heroes are the young women and men that are fighting in Iraq now. What I did was something that any and every New Yorker should do, you know what I'm saying? You see somebody in distress, do the right thing. You know? Help out.''\nAppearing relaxed throughout the City Hall presentation and allowing himself only a ''Wow, O.K.,'' then giving a few thumbs-ups for the Disney trip and tickets to ''The Lion King,'' Mr. Autrey said that the attention had been overwhelming, adding that he had not expected any of the gifts.\nBefore heading off to meet Mr. Trump and make a few more appearances for the news media, he hammered home his point, saying that of dozens of people on the platform, only he and two women went to Mr. Hollopeter's aid.\n''We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms,'' he said. ''We got to show each other some love.''
1816523	Israeli Raid Overshadows Olmert's Talks With Mubarak	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Thursday evening in an effort to give momentum to the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. But the meeting was overshadowed by an Israeli raid in the West Bank in which four Palestinians were killed and 20 wounded.\nMr. Mubarak was clearly embarrassed by the timing of the raid, hours before the meeting of the two leaders in an Egyptian Red Sea resort town, Sharm el Sheik. He called it a hindrance to peace efforts and told Mr. Olmert that Egypt ''rejects and is indignant at the military operation.''\n''Israel's security cannot be achieved through military force but by serious endeavors toward peace,'' Mr. Mubarak added at his news conference with Mr. Olmert.\nMr. Olmert said that he was sorry that innocent Palestinians were hurt, but that Israel would defend itself and was acting to arrest ''terrorists who had killed Israelis.''\nHe gave no explanation for the timing of the daylight raid, a vain attempt to arrest a wanted militant, which used unusual force in normally quiet Ramallah. He said Israeli troops returned fire, but did not initiate it. ''Things developed in a way that could not have been predicted in advance,'' he said. ''If innocent people were hurt, this was not our intention.''\nThe Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, with whom Mr. Olmert met last week, condemned the raid, saying in a statement that it ''proved that the Israeli calls for peace and security are fake.'' Palestinians have been calling for an extension of a Gaza truce with Israel to the West Bank.\n''The continued aggression will only lead to the destruction of all efforts aimed at realizing peace,'' Mr. Abbas said.\nMr. Olmert and Mr. Mubarak said Egypt was continuing its efforts to secure the release of an Israeli corporal captured in June by militants, offering in exchange several hundred Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. There had been speculation that the two men might be able to announce more concrete progress on the matter, which is blocking more substantive discussions with Mr. Abbas.\nEgyptian officials said that they were discussing another Olmert-Abbas meeting with Egyptian and Jordanian leaders present. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is to visit the region this month.\nIt was an unusual and emotional day for Mr. Olmert, during which he commemorated two legendary Israeli political figures, both of whom he succeeded in their jobs.\nEarlier, in Jerusalem, he spoke at the state funeral for the city's fabled former mayor, Teddy Kollek, who died Tuesday at 95 and was buried in the area of the Mount Herzl cemetery reserved for Israel's leaders.\nMr. Olmert defeated Mr. Kollek to become Jerusalem's mayor in a bitter political fight in 1993. He said Israel's first leader, David Ben-Gurion, had declared Jerusalem to be Israel's capital in 1949, but ''Teddy Kollek made it so.''\nThursday also marked a year since Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suffered a second extensive stroke, which left him in a deep coma from which he is not expected to awaken. Mr. Olmert, Mr. Sharon's deputy, was chosen to lead the Kadima Party in his stead and became prime minister, and he acknowledged Mr. Sharon's tragedy at his news conference in Egypt.\nIn general, Mr. Olmert has been regarded as inferior to Mr. Sharon and Mr. Kollek. In the latest opinion poll, conducted by the Dahaf Institute and reported Thursday in the newspaper Yediot Aharanot, nearly 70 percent of Israelis polled said they disapproved of Mr. Olmert's performance as prime minister. Israelis are unhappy with the way he managed the summer's war against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and do not much like his personality, contrasting him with the more stolid and experienced Mr. Sharon.\nStill, Mr. Olmert has proved himself a skilled politician, and early on Thursday Parliament quietly passed his $68 billion budget, a crucial test of his government's ability to survive. The budget battle was always a great drama under Mr. Sharon, but Mr. Olmert, who has expanded his governing coalition to include parties ranging from Labor to the right-wing Israel Beiteinu Party of Avigdor Lieberman, had little difficulty.\nMr. Olmert's office is being rocked, though, by a new corruption scandal. He has not been touched by this scandal, though he has been under investigation for smaller cases of improper use of influence.\nBut his longtime office director, Shula Zaken, has been put under house arrest and ordered not to contact Mr. Olmert as the police investigate whether she and the director of the Tax Authority, Jackie Matza, tried to help Ms. Zaken's brother and two other businesspeople through the appointment of cronies to key jobs in return for tax breaks.\nAbout 30 people are under some form of detention in the spreading scandal.\nThe operation in Ramallah by Israeli forces, with armored vehicles, bulldozers and helicopter support, was carried out hours before Mr. Olmert met with Mr. Mubarak.\nPalestinians and news reports said the operation was to arrest Rabiah Hamad of Fatah, a senior member of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades. The army would not confirm that Mr. Hamad was the target, but said the man it wanted was armed and was wounded, but escaped. The army arrested four other wanted Palestinians, a spokesman said.\nIt was a rare incursion into the heart of Ramallah, and it prompted an angry response. Youths on rooftops threw stones, metal trash barrels, a refrigerator and blocks of concrete at the Israeli Army vehicles. There were mortars fired at the Israeli soldiers, and an exchange of gunfire.\nPalestinian medics said four men -- Yussef Abdel Khader, 23; Khalil al-Badawi, 20; Jamal Jawela, 29; and Ala al-Himran, in his 20s -- died at a Ramallah hospital from gunshot wounds.\nIn Gaza there was continuing violence, with three more men killed in fighting between Fatah and Hamas. The fighting centered around the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza after gunmen surrounded the houses of known political or security figures.\nIn Beit Lahiya, a senior Fatah commander, Col. Muhammad Gharib, was killed and his wife severely wounded when Hamas militants attacked his home with rifle fire and rocket-propelled grenades. Two of his bodyguards were also killed. About 25 others were wounded in Jabaliya, and local radio was filled with appeals to the gunmen to restore calm.\nOn Wednesday five Palestinians, including a woman who was a passer-by, were killed and 12 wounded in Fatah-Hamas gun battles, which broke a weeklong lull. Other militant factions arranged a truce overnight and kidnapped members of Hamas and Fatah were released by the other sides, but the truce broke down on Thursday.\nThe Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, returned to Gaza on Thursday from hajj, his pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. His entourage underwent a special inspection in El Arish, Egypt, to ensure that he was not carrying large amounts of cash back to Gaza, which has been deprived of most Western aid since Hamas won parliamentary elections last January.\n[Early Friday, Mr. Haniya said he and Mr. Abbas had agreed at emergency talks to keep gunmen from their parties off Gaza's streets.]\nFor the fourth day there was no word about a kidnapped Peruvian photographer for Agence France-Presse, Jaime Rázuri, 50, who is said by colleagues to be lacking a required heart medication.\nPalestinian security services have warned foreign journalists to keep out of Gaza for now, because of the kidnappings and chaos.\nA leader of the Palestinian People's Party, Bassam al-Salhi, said the security chaos could be resolved only with political agreement. ''The weakness of the Palestinian political system and the situation of the current Hamas-led government have contributed to this state of lawlessness,'' he said.
1816524	Bush Is Expected to Shift U.S. Ambassador in Iraq to U.N.	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E3DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	President Bush intends to name Zalmay Khalilzad, the Afghan-born diplomat who has been ambassador to Iraq for the past 21 months, to be the new envoy to the United Nations, part of a diplomatic shakeup as Mr. Bush prepares to announce a new strategy for the war.\nA senior administration official, who had been briefed on the decision but had to discuss it anonymously because the change had not been formally announced, confirmed Thursday that the president had decided to nominate Mr. Khalilzad to the United Nations post.\nThe official said Mr. Bush intended to name Ryan C. Crocker, the ambassador to Pakistan, to replace Mr. Khalilzad in Baghdad.\nIf confirmed by the Senate, the appointments would put seasoned, respected diplomats into two of the State Department's most challenging posts. Mr. Khalilzad would replace John R. Bolton, who served temporarily as United Nations ambassador but resigned late last year after concluding he could not win Senate confirmation.\nMr. Bush's decision to transfer Mr. Khalilzad, among the most visible Americans working in Iraq, would effectively accomplish two goals for the administration. As a Sunni Muslim, Mr. Khalilzad has been perceived by some Iraqi Shiites as not sympathetic enough to their views; removing him from Baghdad would help Mr. Bush make a fresh start there. And Mr. Khalilzad had told colleagues that he was ready to leave.\nThe change also would give the United States the strong voice it needs at the United Nations, particularly after the storm surrounding Mr. Bolton.\nThe senior administration official said the White House believed that Mr. Khalilzad, as a Muslim who had extensive experience overseas including a stint as ambassador to his native Afghanistan, would bring an important understanding of the Muslim world to his work at the United Nations.\nDaniel P. Serwer, the executive director of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which recently issued a report recommending a new strategy for Iraq, said a Khalilzad nomination would send a message ''that we are taking the U.N. seriously and sending somebody who has real weight with this administration, and who has served in our toughest post.''\nBut Leon E. Panetta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who was one of five Democrats on the study group, said he feared removing Mr. Khalilzad from Baghdad would leave ''a vacuum'' there at a critical time.\n''The problem we've had in Iraq is that the people who finally get to understand how that country works suddenly leave,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''He's probably a pretty good appointment for the U.N., but you do have to be nervous about who is going to speak for us in Iraq.''\nBut some in the administration have suggested that perhaps Mr. Khalilzad has been too prominent a figure in Iraq.\nIn a classified memorandum written Nov. 8 after visiting Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki in Baghdad, President Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, said that the president might urge Mr. Khalilzad, who goes by the nickname Zal, to take a lower profile as one way to buttress the Maliki government.\nUnder the heading ''What we can do to help Maliki,'' Mr. Hadley ticked off a list of suggestions, among them: ''Encourage Zal to move into the background and let Maliki take more credit for positive developments. (We want Maliki to exert his authority -- and demonstrate to Iraqis that he is a strong leader -- by taking action against extremists, not by pushing back on the United States and the Coalition.)''\nUnlike the other changes to Mr. Bush's foreign policy team in the last 24 hours, which caught much of Washington off guard, the moves involving Mr. Khalilzad and Mr. Crocker have been the subject of speculation here for weeks, since Mr. Bolton resigned on Dec. 5.\nBy that time Mr. Khalilzad had already told colleagues that he was ready to for a change of assignment. ABC News first reported the decision about Mr. Khalilzad on its Web site on Thursday afternoon.\nEducated in Beirut and the United States (he holds a doctorate from the University of Chicago), the blunt-spoken Mr. Khalilzad, 55, has been a prominent figure in American foreign policy circles since the Reagan administration, when he advised the State Department on the Iran-Iraq war and the Soviet war in Afghanistan.\nHe later joined the administration of the first President Bush, where he earned a reputation as a hawk who called for the ouster of Saddam Hussein, advice that administration did not take. More recently, senior administration officials say, he was considered for the No. 2 State Department job that John D. Negroponte is expected to take.\nMr. Crocker, 57, has been a Foreign Service officer since 1971 and is among the State Department's most respected voices in the Middle East. He has been ambassador to Pakistan since 2004, and has served as ambassador to Syria, Kuwait and Lebanon.
1816525	President of Venezuela Fires Deputy and Interior Minister	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E3DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	President Hugo Chávez abruptly fired his vice president and his interior minister on Wednesday night, issuing a rare public acknowledgment that violent crime and prison killings were severe problems.\nMr. Chávez, who announced the dismissals in a telephone call to a talk show on state television, cited grisly prison melees and an inability to prevent a rapid increase in killings as reasons for the removal of Jesse Chacón as the minister of the interior and justice. Mr. Chávez did not give a reason for firing José Vicente Rangel, long one of his closest confidants, as vice president.\n''There are failings in internal security and infrastructure,'' Mr. Chávez said, referring in particular to the clashes this week between rival gangs at Uribana Prison in western Lara State that left 16 inmates dead. An additional six inmates from Uribana were killed after being transferred to another prison in Portuguesa State. Twenty-five inmates have been killed this week in prisons across Venezuela.\nMr. Chávez also cited ''violence in the streets'' in dismissing Mr. Chacón, who was presiding over an effort to reform Venezuela's police forces. Violent crime ranks in polls as the top concern of Venezuelans amid an increase in kidnappings and killings. Homicides are up 67 percent since 1999, when the Chávez presidency began, and the country has one of the highest rates of gun-related deaths in the world, according to Unesco.\nVenezuela's prison system suffers from crowding, corruption and a shortage of trained guards. Violent prison deaths have averaged more than 300 a year for more than a decade. Building prisons has not alleviated the problem.\nSecurity analysts say that part of the difficulty in reducing violent crime levels is related to the frequency with which senior officials overseeing efforts at improving the justice system are moved out of their posts. Mr. Chacón was replaced by Pedro Carreño, a legislator who led an inquiry last year into a $1.5 million embezzlement scheme at a state sugar complex built with help from Cuban technicians in Sabaneta, Mr. Chávez's hometown, in Barinas State. He will be Mr. Chávez's ninth interior minister in eight years.\nOn Thursday, Finance Minister Nelson Merentes said he was stepping down, to be replaced by Rodrigo Cabezas, a leftist legislator and economist.\nMr. Chávez named Jorge Rodríguez, a former medical director at a psychiatric clinic here, as vice president. Mr. Rodríguez, whose father was tortured by the Venezuelan Army in the 1970s, has impeccable credentials in leftist circles. He led the National Electoral Council during a contentious and ultimately unsuccessful effort to recall Mr. Chávez.
1816526	Mr. Negroponte's Newest Job	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E3DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The No. 2 job in the State Department is technically a step down from John Negroponte's present post of director of national intelligence. But the reported return to the foreign policy fold of this former ambassador to Baghdad, and, before that, to the United Nations, has a certain logic to it.\nThe diplomacy-challenged Bush administration could surely use the help. We hope that Mr. Negroponte can provide Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice with the intellectual and bureaucratic reinforcement she so desperately needs to help guide the administration to a wiser course on Iraq.\nMr. Negroponte certainly has experience. In a 40-plus-year career -- including an early stint as a political officer in Vietnam -- he has also served as ambassador to Honduras (during Ronald Reagan's contra war), Mexico and the Philippines. He is known as a canny, and sometimes ruthless, bureaucratic player. What he doesn't have, unfortunately, is much of a reputation for challenging the unwise policy presumptions of his bosses.\nIn his 10 months in Baghdad from mid-2004 to mid-2005, Mr. Negroponte undoubtedly saw the yawning gap between Iraq's grim reality and the delusional claims of success issuing from Washington. While President Bush and other top officials trumpeted effective military training programs, a flowering Iraqi democracy and an insurgency ever on its last legs, anyone on the ground had to see paper Iraqi battalions, the rise of sectarian militias and ever-expanding chaos.\nIf Mr. Negroponte made a serious effort to jolt his bosses back to the real world, there is no public record of it. That will have to change if he is to have any chance of improving things. Before confirming him, the Senate should make sure he understands that asking hard and unwelcome questions is an essential part of the job.\nMr. Negroponte's switch will mean another wrenching shift in the top ranks of America's deeply troubled intelligence agencies. One of the main problems that the national intelligence director's job was created to solve was the destructive rivalries between intelligence agencies run by the Defense Department and their civilian counterparts.\nThat infighting reached a crescendo during the reign of Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon. Mr. Rumsfeld's replacement, Robert Gates, a former director of central intelligence, will have the credibility -- and we hope the will -- to calm those rivalries and improve interagency coordination. Even then, Mr. Bush must quickly find a credible replacement for Mr. Negroponte, preferably one who is willing to jolt his bosses with the truth. This administration's record of failures in Iraq is matched only by its failures on intelligence.\nEditorial
1816527	Lagging Judicial Pay	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E3DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. is embracing with gusto a cause championed by his predecessor, William Rehnquist: the need for a substantial pay raise for federal judges. Justice Roberts devoted his second annual year-end report to this issue, and it should be required reading in Congress.\nGetting Congress to act promptly on judicial salaries may not be easy, if history is any guide. But Mr. Roberts is right to note the link between maintaining an adequate standard of judicial compensation and preserving the quality and independence of the judiciary, and to prod Congress on this issue.\nFor starters, an immediate increase in the neighborhood of 30 percent would help make up for dual blows of inflation and Congress's periodic withholding of cost-of-living adjustments. The last time federal judges received a substantial pay raise was 1989.\nBy statute, a sitting federal trial judge makes $165,200 a year. That's a lot of money, the same pay as a member of Congress. But as the chief justice notes in his report, judges have fallen well behind the American labor force as a whole in keeping up with inflation. Since 1969, a judge's pay has declined by 23.9 percent, adjusted for inflation, while the national average for all wages rose by 17.8 percent.\nFederal judges at every level earn significantly less than law school deans, senior law school professors, and even junior associates at some big-time law firms. There is no definitive study, but it cannot be just coincidental that federal judges are leaving the bench at an increasing rate, thereby ''threatening the viability of life tenure,'' as Justice Roberts put it. Considering the impact on a future job could make judges less willing to issue unpopular rulings upholding important rights.\nIt is tempting to dismiss as hyperbole the chief justice's characterization of this issue as a ''constitutional crisis.'' But the salary issue is a serious one, touching as it does on the two constitutional provisions designed to ensure an independent judiciary -- the one granting life tenure, and the other ensuring no reduction in judicial pay.\nThe chief justice's focus on judicial pay has drawn praise from Senator Patrick Leahy, the new Judiciary Committee chairman and a longtime champion of improved judicial salaries. The nation would be well-served by a comprehensive bipartisan package that grants federal judges a sizable raise, ends the linkage between judicial and Congressional salaries, and requires judges to forgo privately financed junkets that cast an ethical cloud on the courts.\nEditorial
1816528	Tax Cuts and the Minimum Wage	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E3DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	As the minimum wage moves to the top of the new Congress's agenda, some politicians -- mainly President Bush and Senate Republicans -- seem incapable of viewing the issue as anything other than a pretext for more tax cuts. This time the lucky recipients would be small-business owners, who the politicians contend will be unduly harmed by having to pay higher wages. So much for ringing in the new.\nIt has been more than nine years since the government last increased the federal minimum wage, currently $5.15 an hour. During that period inflation has severely eroded the wage's value. Arguing that it is only fair to cut taxes on business owners when the minimum wage goes up is akin to arguing that taxes should have been raised as the wage fell because of inflation. Instead, as the minimum wage has eroded over the past decade, taxes have been cut sharply.\nIt's even doubtful that the wage increase under discussion -- a $2.10 increase over roughly two years, to $7.25 -- would impair business. Eighty-six percent of small-business owners surveyed by the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index said the minimum wage had no effect on their businesses.\nThere's also no reason to believe that the proposed tax cuts would be aimed at employers of low-wage workers. In 2006, when Congress tried to link the minimum wage to tax cuts, the proposals included an estate-tax cut for America's wealthiest families. One proposal now being considered would allow small businesses to write off a larger part of their attorney fees when they go to court to challenge federal regulations. It sounds like a stretch to us that typical employers of minimum-wage workers -- say, restaurants and small factories -- are in any great need of relief from the high cost of federal litigation.\nAnd then there's the probability that tax cuts would cost the government far more than a wage increase would ever cost employers, driving up the budget deficit. The Economic Policy Institute analyzed the tax cuts that were linked to an unsuccessful attempt to raise the minimum wage in 2000. Those cuts would have cost $123 billion over 10 years, versus $11.2 billion for the wage increase.\nIt's that sort of idiocy the new Congress was elected to stop. Chances are good the House of Representatives will eschew tax cuts and pass a clean bill to raise the minimum wage. The Senate should follow suit. And President Bush should sign it.\nEditorial
1816529	Rethinking the Death Penalty	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	New Jersey could take the lead among states in abolishing the death penalty if it follows the recommendation that a legislative commission made this week. It is the right thing to do, and not just because capital punishment is barbaric and a poor deterrent. It has become increasingly clear as the use of DNA evidence has grown that there is simply too great a risk of making an irreversible mistake.\nWhile we would have used stronger language, we applaud the 13-member panel for having the courage to recommend that New Jersey become the first state to abolish the death penalty since states began reinstating it 35 years ago. The commission included two prosecutors, a police chief, members of the clergy and a man whose daughter was murdered in 2000. Only one member, a former state senator who wrote the death penalty law, dissented.\nAlthough it has nine people on death row, New Jersey has had a moratorium on executions since 2005 and has not put anyone to death since 1963. Nevertheless, the panel's recommendation that the death penalty be replaced with life imprisonment without parole is likely to have significant influence both inside and outside the state. It comes as about 10 of the 38 states with death penalties, including New York, have suspended executions and as recent developments, like DNA exonerations and a botched lethal injection in Florida last month, have created a growing unease about executions.\nWith Gov. Jon Corzine opposed to the death penalty, and substantial numbers of capital punishment opponents in both houses of the Legislature, there is a reasonable chance the commission's recommendations will become law. That would make New Jersey's criminal justice system more civilized and fair. It could also prod other states to abandon their own use of what Justice Harry Blackmun called the ''machinery of death.''\nEditorial

Bush can't just get along.\nThe answer is simple: Some wealthy politicians use their positions to further the interests of the wealthy.\nThey pursue policies that shift income upward and the tax burden down; that strip away protections for workers; that favor insurance companies, drug makers and other corporate interests over the interests of ordinary people.\nBut other wealthy politicians think that public servants are supposed to serve the public.\nThe wealthy-for-the-wealthy politicians resent their more publicly minded peers and invent clever denigrations like ''traitor to his class'' or ''limousine liberal.''\nBecause, as Mr. Brooks notes, political success depends on the ability to raise large sums of money, the wealthy will be overrepresented in public office. We are lucky that at least a few of them -- the Kennedys, Pelosis, Kerrys and others -- sometimes fight against their more self-serving wealthy counterparts rather than just going along.\nJay Livingston New York, Jan. 4, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nDavid Brooks dreams of reconciliation between our ranch-owning millionaire Republicans like George W. Bush and our vineyard-owning millionaire Democrats like Nancy Pelosi. His alternative dream is that a group of ''highly attractive dimwits'' spread ''bland but worthy stability over our political scene.''\nHow about this one mundane dream: universal health care for all American citizens regardless of wits, party or money?\nSuzy Sandor New York, Jan. 4, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nIt's true that Speaker Nancy Pelosi's wealth facilitated her election to the House. Unlike her fellow ''plutocrats'' on the other side of the aisle, however, her policy agenda is topped by bills to increase the minimum wage and to insure the nearly 50 million Americans without medical coverage, not expand the privileges of the ''haves'' and the ''have mores.''\nRather than discovering the class solidarity that David Brooks sarcastically commends, the rest of us should be glad that Democrats in many of their legislative goals remain traitors to their class.\nMarc Joseph Oakland, Calif., Jan. 4, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nDavid Brooks chides Nancy Pelosi for owning a vineyard, being chauffeured to school as a child, investing in high-end real estate, and wearing pearls.\nYet Republicans have always maintained that wealth is a natural right in our country -- and how do her offenses compare with those of a political leader who sends 3,000 troops to die in a false war?\nPete Laine Fairfax, Va., Jan. 4, 2007

But it also reminds us of the diminishing encouragement of certain values in many of our next generation.\nPerhaps because he was raised that way or because of his Navy roots, the choice Mr. Autrey made was the product of the values of courage, honor and selfless service, values that he will probably pass to his children, who witnessed his incredible act of bravery.\nAll citizens should ask themselves whether they could do what Mr. Autrey did. They should ask whether their kids will.\nJoshua S. Eisenberg New York, Jan. 3, 2007\nThe writer is a lawyer and a captain in the Army National Guard.\nTo the Editor:\nWesley Autrey's rapid response gives us all hope that we would react the same way when faced with a similar situation.\nIt was helping another individual who needed it, and I want to add my applause.\nHelp one another, and we can all make it through today's crazy world a little more easily.

To say that the execution was ''a shaming embarrassment'' and that ''all Americans will be blamed'' is an understatement.\nIf the United States' pre-emptive invasion of Iraq is considered one of the major strategic blunders in American history, the execution of Saddam Hussein while the United States was the occupying force in Iraq may come close to rivaling that blunder.\nWhy couldn't Iraqi justice be served once there was a functioning Iraqi government and United States forces were out of Iraq, and why couldn't the Bush administration have insisted that this be so?\nLeonard Cohen Sugar Land, Tex., Jan. 4, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nLies were told to go to this war, and lies were told to extend it.

Could it be that it is the execution itself that lacks dignity and courtesy?\nJohn Maguire Oakland, Calif., Jan. 3, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nSuch a fuss in your paper over the ''abusive conduct'' toward Saddam Hussein! Perhaps the Shiites should have consulted Miss Manners on the proper decorum for the execution of a mass murderer?\nDonald Hoffmann Kansas City, Mo., Jan. 3, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nTony Snow, the White House press secretary, when asked about the appalling cellphone video of Saddam Hussein's execution, declared that ''the most important thing to keep in mind is, this is a guy who killed hundreds of thousands of people and received justice,'' while absolving the Americans of responsibility for handing him over to the Shiite Iraqi regime just minutes before he was hanged (''Despite Misgivings, White House Says Little Against Hanging,'' news article, Jan. 4).\nSupervising hasty executions, of course, was one of George W. Bush's precious few qualifications for office six years ago. Still, the White House cannot have it both ways, extolling the virtues of democracy while overlooking the expanding disaster in Iraq.\nThe world's democracies, many of which have banned the death penalty, can only conclude that America cares little for the rule of law.\nTimothy Stewart-Winter Chicago, Jan. 4, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nWhy is it so hard for our elected officials to admit error? The lynching of Saddam Hussein was wrong, whether or not you agree with capital punishment and irrespective of the magnitude of his crimes.\nThis administration is quick to condemn homosexuality, abortion and euthanasia.

I believe that the White House and all board members agree with me -- as do the American people.\nBut oversight and vigilance by the legislative and judicial branches are required to help the executive branch maintain this delicate and sometimes difficult balance. I believe there is no disagreement on that point either.\nProviding oversight regarding this balance is, in my judgment, the most important responsibility of the board.\nLanny J.

1816536	MAN IN THE NEWS -- John Michael McConnell; A Member of the Club	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E2DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	In choosing Mike McConnell to be director of national intelligence, President Bush is turning again to a steady intelligence professional who first achieved prominence during his father's administration.\nLike Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the Central Intelligence Agency director, Mr. McConnell, 63, a retired vice admiral, has served as director of the National Security Agency, the eavesdropping giant. Like Robert M. Gates, the new defense secretary and former C.I.A. director, Mr. McConnell first operated in the highest circles of government in the tumultuous time that included the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and the fall of the Soviet Union.\n''It's a gathering of the clan,'' said retired Adm. Bobby R. Inman, himself a former director of the National Security Agency and an early promoter of Mr. McConnell's intelligence career. ''You're getting strong professionals in all these top jobs. They'll set out to solve problems, and they won't be motivated by turf or politics.''\nWilliam P. Crowell, who worked as Mr. McConnell's deputy at the N.S.A., called him a ''consummate professional'' who managed the agency with great care at a difficult time of severe post-cold-war budget cuts. Ronald D. Lee, who worked as the security agency's general counsel under Mr. McConnell, called him ''an exceptionally gifted leader who was completely devoted to the rule of law and the Constitution.''\nBut W. Patrick Lang, a former Defense Intelligence Agency official who has been highly critical of the Bush administration, took a more skeptical view. He called Mr. McConnell, who made his career in naval intelligence, ''competent but compliant'' and expressed concern that he might not stand up to policy makers, particularly on highly charged issues like Iran's nuclear program.\nFor the last 10 years, Mr. McConnell, a courtly, soft-spoken South Carolina native, has been out of government, working for Booz Allen Hamilton, the consulting company. But much of his work has been for government agencies on intelligence and information security, and he has often written and spoken about the organization and future of spying.\nColleagues say he was first approached several months ago about the possibility of replacing General Hayden as deputy to John D. Negroponte, the director of national intelligence. He turned down that job and was eventually invited to succeed Mr. Negroponte in the top job.\nMr. McConnell first came to public attention as the top intelligence officer to Gen. Colin L. Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, during the 1991 war. He conducted daily briefings not only for General Powell but for the defense secretary, Dick Cheney, now the vice president. He had contact with Mr. Gates, Mr. Hayden and Condoleezza Rice, now secretary of state, all of whom worked on the National Security Council in the administration of Mr. Bush's father.\n''He was measured, methodical and detailed,'' Bill Smullen, then an aide to General Powell, said of Mr. McConnell's war briefings. ''Secretary Cheney saw Mike McConnell in action on a daily basis.''\nMr. McConnell became a familiar figure on television during the gulf war, explaining troop movements and airstrikes. But on becoming director of the security agency in 1992 he retreated behind its traditional curtain of secrecy.\nMatthew M. Aid, a historian of the agency, said that during his four-year tenure, the agency's monitoring did not keep up with the revolutionary technological changes in communications, including the Internet, cellphones and fiber-optic cable. But he said Mr. McConnell had been handicapped by a steadily declining budget and work force.\n''He begged and borrowed and took money from research and development to pay for operations,'' achieving considerable success in tracking the warring parties during the war in Bosnia, Mr. Aid said.\nJohn Michael McConnell was born on July 26, 1943, in Greenville, S.C., where his father worked in the shipping business and his mother in the garment industry. He graduated from Furman University and was commissioned as a line officer of the Navy in 1967. He served a tour in Vietnam and then became an intelligence officer.\nHe is married to Terry McConnell, a homemaker, and has two children and two stepchildren, all grown.\nFormer colleagues invariably remark on his quiet and courteous manner and say he rarely shows a temper. On Thursday some wondered whether that was the right temperament for a job created to force 16 competing and sometimes feuding agencies to cooperate and share information.\nBut Mark M. Lowenthal, who served as staff director for the House Intelligence Committee when Mr. McConnell ran the National Security Agency, said he was not concerned about that.\n''His quiet manner and his lovely South Carolina accent belie it, but I have no doubt he can be forceful when necessary,'' Mr. Lowenthal said. He noted that Mr. McConnell had thrived at Booz Allen. ''You don't do that by being shy and retiring,'' he said.
1816538	The First Energy President	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E1DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Now that President Gerald Ford has been buried with all the honors he deserved, it is time to discuss a proper memorial. I would suggest the Gerald Ford Energy Independence Act.\nFew people remember today, but ''Gerald Ford was the first U.S. president to really use the levers of the presidency to try to break our addiction to oil,'' said the energy economist Philip Verleger Jr. ''He was way ahead of his time.''\nWell, his time has come again -- and then some.\nThe greatest thing George Bush could do -- for President Ford's legacy and his own -- would be to dedicate his upcoming State of the Union address to completing the energy independence agenda that Mr. Ford initiated 32 years ago in the wake of the 1973 Arab oil embargo and energy shock.\nAs the page titled ''Energy'' from the Ford presidential library Web site reminds us: ''Early in his administration, President Ford said that he would not sit by and watch the nation continue to talk about an energy crisis and do nothing about it. Nor, he said, would he accept halfway measures which failed to change the direction that has made our nation so vulnerable to foreign economic interests. The president proposed firm but necessary measures designed to achieve energy independence for the U.S. by 1985, and to regain our position of world leadership in energy.''\nIn his 1975 State of the Union speech, President Ford laid out his vision: ''I have a very deep belief in America's capabilities. Within the next 10 years, my program envisions: 200 major nuclear power plants; 250 major new coal mines; 150 major coal-fired power plants; 30 major new [oil] refineries; 20 major new synthetic fuel plants; the drilling of many thousands of new oil wells; the insulation of 18 million homes; and the manufacturing and the sale of millions of new automobiles, trucks and buses that use much less fuel. In another crisis -- the one in 1942 -- President Franklin D. Roosevelt said this country would build 60,000 military aircraft. By 1943, production in that program had reached 125,000 aircraft annually. They did it then. We can do it now.''\nObviously, President Ford's emphasis on coal and domestic oil came in age when most people were unaware of climate change. Still, Mr. Ford wasn't just all talk on energy. He used his presidential powers to impose a $3-a-barrel fee on imported oil to reduce consumption. That was a big deal, noted Mr. Verleger, because the average cost of imported crude at the time was only $10.76 a barrel.\nYes, you read that right. A Republican president actually imposed an import fee on oil to curb consumption! Yes, President Bush, it can be done! The republic survived!\nThanks to the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975 and other measures, Mr. Ford's energy legacy includes: the creation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for use in an emergency; the phasing out of domestic price controls on oil to encourage more exploration; major investment in alternative energy research; assistance to states in developing energy conservation programs; and, most important, the creation of the first compulsory mileage standards for U.S. automobiles.\nThose mileage standards have barely been tightened since 1975 -- because some idiotic congressmen from Michigan, who thought they were protecting Detroit, have blocked efforts to raise them. So, Japanese automakers innovated more in that area, and the rest is history -- or in the case of Detroit, obituary.\nEvery 10 years we say to ourselves, ''If only we had done the right thing 10 years ago.'' Well, President Bush has a chance in his State of the Union to call on Americans to honor Mr. Ford by completing his vision. But it means asking Americans to do some hard things: accepting a gasoline or carbon tax; inducing Detroit to make more fuel-efficient cars, trucks and plug-in hybrids; setting a national requirement for utilities to provide 20 percent of their electricity from renewable wind, solar, hydro or nuclear power by 2015; and, finally, making large-scale investments in mass transit.\nIt is stunning that since 9/11 the Bush team has never mounted a campaign to get Americans to conserve energy.\n''Ford called for zero oil imports by 1985,'' said Mr. Verleger. ''Instead, we imported five million barrels a day then. In 2006, imports will average almost 14 million barrels a day. Had we achieved everything Ford proposed, the price of oil today would be $20 a barrel, not $60, the polar ice caps might not be melting, the polar bear might still have a chance, and our children would have a future.''\nOp-Ed Columnist

1816540	First, Do Less Harm	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E1DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Universal health care, much as we need it, won't happen until there's a change of management in the White House. In the meantime, however, Congress can take an important step toward making our health care system less wasteful, by fixing the Medicare Middleman Multiplication Act of 2003.\nOfficially, of course, it was the Medicare Modernization Act. But as we learned during the debate over Social Security, in Bushspeak ''modernize'' is a synonym for ''privatize.'' And one of the main features of the legislation was an effort to bring private-sector fragmentation and inefficiency to one of America's most important public programs.\nThe process actually started in the 1990s, when Medicare began allowing recipients to replace traditional Medicare -- in which the government pays doctors and hospitals -- with private managed-care plans, in which the government pays a fee to an H.M.O. The magic of the marketplace was supposed to cut Medicare's costs.\nThe plan backfired. H.M.O.'s received fees reflecting the medical costs of the average Medicare recipient, but to maximize profits they selectively enrolled only healthier seniors, leaving sicker, more expensive people in traditional Medicare. Once Medicare became aware of this cream-skimming and started adjusting payments to reflect beneficiaries' health, the H.M.O.'s began dropping out: their extra layer of bureaucracy meant that they had higher costs than traditional Medicare and couldn't compete on a financially fair basis.\nThat should have been the end of the story. But for the Bush administration and its Congressional allies, privatization isn't a way to deliver better government services -- it's an end in itself. So the 2003 legislation increased payments to Medicare-supported H.M.O.'s, which were renamed Medicare Advantage plans. These plans are now heavily subsidized.\nAccording to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent federal body that advises Congress on Medicare issues, Medicare Advantage now costs 11 percent more per beneficiary than traditional Medicare. According to the Commonwealth Fund, which has a similar estimate of the excess cost, the subsidy to private H.M.O.'s cost Medicare $5.4 billion in 2005.\nThe inability of private middlemen to win a fair competition against traditional Medicare was embarrassing to those who sing the praises of privatization. Maybe that's why the Bush administration made sure that there is no competition at all in Part D, the drug program. There's no traditional Medicare version of Part D, in which the government pays drug costs directly. Instead, the elderly must get coverage from a private insurance company, which then receives a government subsidy.\nAs a result, Part D is highly confusing. It's also needlessly expensive, for two reasons: the insurance companies add an extra layer of bureaucracy, and they have limited ability to bargain with drug companies for lower prices (and Medicare is prohibited from bargaining on their behalf). One indicator of how much Medicare is overspending is the sharp rise in prices paid by millions of low-income seniors whose drug coverage has been switched from Medicaid, which doesn't rely on middlemen and does bargain over prices, to the new Medicare program.\nThe costs imposed on Medicare by gratuitous privatization are almost certainly higher than the cost of providing health insurance to the eight million children in the United States who lack coverage. But recent news analyses have suggested that Democrats may not be able to guarantee coverage to all children because this would conflict with their pledge to be fiscally responsible. Isn't it strange how fiscal responsibility is a big concern when Congress is trying to help children, but a nonissue when Congress is subsidizing drug and insurance companies?\nWhat should Congress do? The new Democratic majority is poised to reduce drug prices by allowing -- and, probably, requiring -- Medicare to negotiate prices on behalf of the private drug plans. But it should go further, and force Medicare to offer direct drug coverage that competes on a financially fair basis with the private plans. And it should end the subsidy to Medicare Advantage, forcing H.M.O.'s to engage in fair competition with traditional Medicare.\nConservatives will fight fiercely against these moves. They say they believe in competition -- but they're against competition that might show the public sector doing a better job than the private sector. Progressives should support these moves for the same reason. Ending the subsidies to middlemen, in addition to saving a lot of money, would point the way to broader health care reform.\nOp-Ed Columnist
1816541	Denying the Facts, Finding the Truth	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE1DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	ONE of the pop heroes of the Iraq war was undoubtedly Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, the unfortunate Iraqi information minister who, in his daily press conferences during the invasion, heroically denied even the most evident facts and stuck to the Iraqi line. Even with American tanks only a few hundred yards from his office, he continued to claim that the televised shots of tanks on the Baghdad streets were just Hollywood special effects.\nIn his very performance as an excessive caricature, Mr. Sahhaf thereby revealed the hidden truth of the ''normal'' reporting: there were no refined spins in his comments, just a plain denial. There was something refreshingly liberating about his interventions, which displayed a striving to be liberated from the hold of facts and thus of the need to spin away their unpleasant aspects: his stance was, ''Whom do you believe, your eyes or my words?''\nFurthermore, sometimes, he even struck a strange truth -- when confronted with claims that Americans were in control of parts of Baghdad, he snapped back: ''They are not in control of anything -- they don't even control themselves!''\nWhat, exactly, do they not control? Back in 1979, in her essay ''Dictatorship and Double Standards,'' published in Commentary, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick elaborated the distinction between ''authoritarian'' and ''totalitarian'' regimes. This concept served as the justification of the American policy of collaborating with right-wing dictators while treating Communist regimes much more harshly: authoritarian dictators are pragmatic rulers who care about their power and wealth and are indifferent toward ideological issues, even if they pay lip service to some big cause; in contrast, totalitarian leaders are selfless fanatics who believe in their ideology and are ready to put everything at stake for their ideals.\nHer point was that, while one can deal with authoritarian rulers who react rationally and predictably to material and military threats, totalitarian leaders are much more dangerous and have to be directly confronted.\nThe irony is that this distinction encapsulates perfectly what went wrong with the United States occupation of Iraq: Saddam Hussein was a corrupt authoritarian dictator striving to keep his hold on power and guided by brutal pragmatic considerations (which led him to collaborate with the United States in the 1980s). The ultimate proof of his regime's secular nature is the fact that in the Iraqi elections of October 2002 -- in which Saddam Hussein got a 100 percent endorsement, and thus overdid the best Stalinist results of 99.95 percent -- the campaign song played again and again on all the state media was Whitney Houston's ''I Will Always Love You.''\nOne outcome of the American invasion is that it has generated a much more uncompromising ''fundamentalist'' politico-ideological constellation in Iraq. This has led to a predominance of the pro-Iranian political forces there -- the intervention basically delivered Iraq to Iranian influence. One can imagine how, if President Bush were to be court-martialed by a Stalinist judge, he would be instantly condemned as an ''Iranian agent.'' The violent outbursts of the recent Bush politics are thus not exercises in power, but rather exercises in panic.\nRecall the old story about the factory worker suspected of stealing: every evening, when he was leaving work, the wheelbarrow he rolled in front of him was carefully inspected, but the guards could not find anything, it was always empty. Finally, they got the point: what the worker was stealing were the wheelbarrows themselves.\nThis is the trick being attempted by those who claim today, ''But the world is nonetheless better off without Saddam!'' They forget to factor into the account the effects of the very military intervention against him. Yes, the world is better without Saddam Hussein -- but is it better if we include into the overall picture the ideological and political effects of this very occupation?\nThe United States as a global policeman -- why not? The post-cold-war situation effectively called for some global power to fill the void. The problem resides elsewhere: recall the common perception of the United States as a new Roman Empire. The problem with today's America is not that it is a new global empire, but that it is not one. That is, while pretending to be an empire, it continues to act like a nation-state, ruthlessly pursuing its interests. It is as if the guiding vision of recent American politics is a weird reversal of the well-known motto of the ecologists -- act globally, think locally.\nAfter 9/11, the United States was given the opportunity to realize what kind of world it was part of. It might have used the opportunity -- but it did not, instead opting to reassert its traditional ideological commitments: out with the responsibility and guilt with respect to the impoverished third world -- we are the victims now!\nApropos of the Hague tribunal, the British writer Timothy Garton Ash pathetically claimed: ''No Führer or Duce, no Pinochet, Amin or Pol Pot, should ever again feel themselves protected from the reach of international law by the palace gates of sovereignty.'' One should simply take note of what is missing in this series of names which, apart from the standard couple of Hitler and Mussolini, contains three third world dictators: where is at least one name from the major powers who might sleep a bit uneasily?\nOr, closer to the standard list of the bad guys, why was there little talk of delivering Saddam Hussein or, say, Manuel Noriega to The Hague? Why was the only trial against Mr. Noriega for drug trafficking, rather than for his murderous abuses as a dictator? Was it because he would have disclosed his past ties with the C.I.A.?\nIn a similar way, Saddam Hussein's regime was an abominable authoritarian state, guilty of many crimes, mostly toward its own people. However, one should note the strange but key fact that, when the United States representatives and the Iraqi prosecutors were enumerating his evil deeds, they systematically omitted what was undoubtedly his greatest crime in terms of human suffering and of violating international justice: his invasion of Iran. Why? Because the United States and the majority of foreign states were actively helping Iraq in this aggression.\nAnd now the United States is continuing, through other means, this greatest crime of Saddam Hussein: his never-ending attempt to topple the Iranian government. This is the price you have to pay when the struggle against the enemies is the struggle against the evil ghosts in your own closet: you don't even control yourself.\nOp-Ed Contributor Slavoj Zizek, the international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, is the author, most recently, of ''The Parallax View.''
1816542	Mets Wait for Cost of Starters to Drop	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E0DC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Until the cost of a front-line starter drops to a more palatable price, the Mets will continue to debate whether to add a cost-effective veteran to smooth the transition for their younger pitchers. If the price is right, the Mets are interested in the right-handers Tomo Ohka and Tony Armas, who know General Manager Omar Minaya from their time together in Montreal.\nThey are not willing to offer a long-term deal, preferring that Ohka or Armas bridge the gap between the rotation's 40-somethings (Tom Glavine and Orlando Hernández) and its potential younger members like John Maine, Oliver Pérez, Mike Pelfrey and Philip Humber.\nOhka would probably cost more than Armas. Okha made $4.53 million last season, and his agent, Jim Masteralexis, said yesterday that he had received some two-year offers. Armas made $2.1 million last year and could probably be acquired for a slight raise.\nNeither pitcher had a particularly memorable season last year. Ohka, who will be 31 on March 18, went 4-5 with a 4.82 earned run average for Milwaukee. He missed about three months with a slight injury to his rotator cuff and a hamstring injury. Masteralexis said that Ohka was healthy and training back home in Japan.\n''I've provided the medicals from the Milwaukee Brewers to every team that's requested them,'' Masteralexis said. ''We welcome any examination from a doctor, if we were to go that far with a team down the road.''\nArmas, 28, went 9-12 with a 5.03 E.R.A. for Washington, but he still has time to rejuvenate his career.\nThe Mets are more likely to sign the free-agent outfielder David Newhan, a left-handed hitter who hit .252 with 4 home runs and 18 runs batted in as a reserve outfielder with Baltimore last season. Newhan, 33, would add insurance and, with his versatility, could push for a spot in spring training. Most of the Mets' bench appears to be set; Ramón Castro, Endy Chávez, Ben Johnson, Julio Franco and Damion Easley are almost certain to make it. But if the Mets, like last year, keep another reserve player at the start of the season, Newhan would have a greater chance of making the team.\nBASEBALL

There was no person to go with the limb. Nearby a charred body was still smoldering, smoke coming off the black corpse 45 minutes after the attack.\nFor 50 yards, the dead were scattered about, some in pieces, some whole but badly burned.\nThis violence on Thursday involved two bombs timed to go off one after another in the formerly upscale neighborhood of Mansour, which continues to be ripped apart by sectarian violence. Thirteen people were killed and 22 wounded, just a small fraction of the civilians killed across the country this week.\nThe first device went off at 10:15 a.m., probably a roadside bomb set on a timer, officials said.\nThe attack was apparently aimed at a gasoline station. Cars were lined up around the block waiting for fuel, and dozens of people, grasping large plastic jugs, hoped to buy heating fuel.\nJust moments after the first explosion, a second, larger, car bomb detonated.\nThe neighborhood has traditionally been a mixed Sunni and Shiite one. Although the Abu Jaffar gas station, where the attack was centered, is in what is considered a Sunni area, the method of the attack -- multiple bombs timed to explode in succession -- is usually thought of as a trademark of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a Sunni insurgent group.\nAn hour after the explosion, there was still a strong stench of burning gasoline and fire. The road was slick with sludge from the water used to douse the fire. Blood pooled in areas. Scores of armed men were running about, including members of the Iraqi Army and the police. Some of those with machine guns had no uniforms at all.\nShots rang out, mostly in warning. Neighbors gathered outside, oddly calm and seemingly accustomed to such carnage.\nA tanker truck filled with fuel was parked near the station, having escaped the blast.\nNot surprisingly, residents living near the area blamed everyone from the government to the Americans to terrorists for what had happened.\n''We are just innocent people,'' said Nafia Abdul Jabbar. ''The people killed were poor, in need of kerosene that they cannot afford to buy on the black market because the price is 10 times more than it is at the station.''\nElsewhere, a mortar attack was directed at the Shiite neighborhood of Huriya, wounding three people, officials said.\nClashes on the outskirts of the Sunni neighborhood of Ghazaliya left two people dead and 25 people wounded, Iraqi officials said. A grenade attack in the Amin neighborhood killed five people.\nAcross the city on Thursday, officials said, 47 bodies were found mutilated -- 4 of them with their heads cut off.\nAn interview with the family of a man recently mutilated and killed, a prominent sheik considered to be the prince of the Tamim tribes, gives a glimpse into the complicated underworld that is, in part, responsible for the trucks full of bodies collected around this city every day.\nThe man, Sheik Hamid Mohammed al-Suhail, 75, was found Wednesday in the Shuala neighborhood of Baghdad, a Shiite redoubt, by members of his tribe, which is mixed Shiite and Sunni, who were searching for him. He disappeared last Sunday, and his mutilated body was found wrapped in a blanket, covered in blood. The search party recognized his body by the distinctive way the beard was trimmed.\nHe had been an outspoken critic of the sectarian fighting and participated in a recent conference in Cairo on national reconciliation.\nThe kidnappers, whom his relatives hinted they knew but would describe only as ''militiamen'' for fear of reprisal, initially called his family asking for $100,000, said a nephew, Sheik Ali Sammi al-Suhail.\nThe family told the kidnappers they did not have the money, the nephew said.\n''The body was mutilated in a brutal way,'' he said. ''They used a drill on him and perhaps other tools.''\nOne hand and one leg were almost completely severed.\nThe nephew said he had been told by people who said they witnessed the killing that after his uncle was tortured, his body was thrown from a two-story building. He survived the fall but was brutalized further before finally being killed.\nAnother prominent Iraqi figure, Sheik Akram al-Zubeidi, was killed Thursday in Karbala, a Shiite holy city where there has been little sectarian strife. Sheik Zubeidi was assassinated when he was stopped at a fake checkpoint, a local hospital official said.\nThree other people in the car with him were also killed by the gunmen, whose motive was unclear.\nThere was continued fallout Thursday from the execution of Saddam Hussein, as Sunnis, from Kashmir to Libya, used his death as a rallying point.\nThe Libyan government announced that it would erect a statue of him to stand next to one of Libya's own national heroes, news agencies reported.\nAt least nine people were hurt in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir when the police fired rubber-coated bullets to break up a large group of people protesting the execution, Reuters reported.\nTwo Iraqi officials involved in the investigation of the distribution of a graphic video of the hanging said Thursday that a second guard was being held for questioning. Officials announced the arrest of the first guard on Wednesday.\nThere is increasing pressure, including from the White House, on the Iraqi government to proceed with caution in carrying out the execution of Mr. Hussein's two co-defendants, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Mr. Hussein's half brother, and Awad al-Bandar, a former judge.\nDespite the international reaction directed at the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, Mr. Maliki's popularity among Shiites in southern Iraq seems to have increased.\nIn Basra, Iraq's second largest city, hundreds of demonstrators representing Islamist parties rallied in the streets, praising Mr. Maliki and setting photos of Mr. Hussein on fire.\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ

1816547	Lawmakers Criticize Video Of Hussein's Final Minutes	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01EFDC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The execution of Saddam Hussein was initially hailed as an example of democratic justice being served in Iraq, but leading members of Congress said Thursday that the conduct surrounding the hanging could undermine United States strategy in Iraq and complicate efforts to help the new Iraqi government succeed.\nThe White House has declined to criticize the execution, portions of which were shown online in a bootlegged video. Several Republican senators who have been among President Bush's biggest supporters in the Iraq war said they were troubled by the video and fearful of the reverberations it could provoke.\n''It's a very bad thing, it's harmful, and I'm sorry that it happened,'' said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who has been a White House ally on its Iraq policy. ''Obviously, it unnecessarily inflames the emotions of the Sunnis.''\nWhile the White House says that Mr. Bush has not seen the video -- recorded without authorization with a cellphone camera -- several members of Congress said that they had seen it. More important, they said, the rest of the world had, too.\nAs Mr. Bush inches closer to presenting his revised Iraq plan, Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed dismay at the scene surrounding the final minutes of Mr. Hussein's life. They said it was another sign of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's inability to deal with the sectarian divide in Iraq.\n''It is a very unfortunate episode, and they are still trying to sort out accountability,'' said Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia. ''The key to success in Iraq -- whatever success we are able to achieve -- is reconciliation, and this certainly was not a helpful chapter in that.''\nWhether the execution ultimately has political repercussions beyond Iraq and here in the United States remains an open question. But as senators prepared to be called to the White House as early as Friday for briefings about the president's Iraq plan, the video emerged as a new complication.\nIn the video, Mr. Hussein was shown standing with the noose around his neck at dawn last Saturday in Baghdad, facing a barrage of mockery and derision from unseen tormentors. The images showed Mr. Hussein amid shouts of ''Go to hell!'' and ''Moktada! Moktada! Moktada!'' in reference to a radical Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr.\nSpeaking at the White House after a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Thursday, Mr. Bush said he had wished the execution had ''been done in a more dignified way.'' He said he appreciated that Mr. Maliki was investigating the way the execution was handled, but that he did not dwell on it during their video conference on Thursday. Mr. Bush said Mr. Hussein had received a fair trial, the likes of which his enemies had not. ''He was given justice; the thousands of people he killed were not,'' Mr. Bush said.\nSenator Susan M. Collins, a Maine Republican, said she was troubled by the swiftness of the execution, adding that ''taunting someone who is about to be executed is just blatantly unacceptable.'' The images contained in the video would almost certainly inflame sectarian tensions throughout the region, she said.\n''I have no grief for Saddam Hussein, but it makes it more difficult for Iraqi leaders to forge the political solution that I think is necessary to quell the violence,'' Ms. Collins said. ''It threatens the very existence of the nation and thousands of Americans and Iraqi lives to have Saddam mocked before his execution.''\nIt was unclear whether the newly ascendant Democrats in Congress planned to make an issue of the handling of the execution. It is not likely to be a part of promised Senate hearings on President Bush's Iraq policy, according to aides in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nAt the State Department, the official response has been that the execution, while imperfect, is in the past and that people should move on. But aides to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice continued to bemoan what one official called ''the idea that of all the people in that room, Saddam Hussein was the one who looked like he had the most dignity.''\nSenator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican, said the circumstances surrounding the execution were ''another factor that makes life more difficult for the Iraqi government as well as for our hopes for that government and stability.'' But the video, he said, ''is by no means the most difficult issue we are facing in Iraq.''\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ
1816548	Punishment Laps Help Jets Kick Penalty Habit	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00EFDC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The realization came during training camp. The Jets' owner, Woody Johnson, was watching a practice from the sideline when his franchise quarterback, Chad Pennington, jogged past while running a punishment lap for making a rare mental error. It was then that Johnson knew that his new coach, Eric Mangini, would be a stickler for correctness.\nUnder Mangini's predecessor, Herman Edwards, the Jets did a good job when it came to self-discipline. They led the N.F.L. in fewest penalties during Edwards's rookie season, in 2001. And last season, despite a 4-12 record, the Jets inflicted relatively little harm on themselves, finishing with the fifth fewest penalties in the league.\nBut this season has been even better, with the Jets ranking No. 3 in the league in fewest penalties (70) and No. 2 in penalty yardage (560). Of the 12 teams in the postseason, no one has better penalty numbers than the Jets, a testament to their self-control and a clear factor in their surprising success.\nIn a season in which the Jets were breaking in a rookie head coach, using coordinators who had never called plays in the N.F.L. and relying on a backfield bereft of Curtis Martin, there was virtually no margin for error, no way for the Jets to succeed if they tripped themselves with repeated penalties. They didn't.\nMangini's message of playing smart was reinforced through the running of extra laps for practice infractions that fell under the category of self-destruction, like turnovers, penalties and mental errors. All those laps later, the Jets are getting ready for a first-round playoff game on Sunday against New England.\n''Those laps have a lot to do with it,'' safety Rashad Washington said Thursday with a wry laugh. ''Those things get tiring, especially after you've been practicing twice a day and you end up having to run a lap in the middle of practice, then come back and jump right back in. You try your best in practice not to make dumb penalties so you don't have to run, and it carries over to the game.''\nThe discipline displayed by the Jets received mostly lip service from the playoff-bound Giants. Despite having a coach, Tom Coughlin, with a reputation for being a disciplinarian, the Giants were among the most penalized teams in the league this season. They ranked No. 22 in fewest penalties, with 101, and were 23rd in fewest penalty yards (881). Last season they were even worse.\nIn fact, each New York team has been a reflection of its coach, with the Jets playing with the dispassionate poise of the poker-faced Mangini and the Giants (8-8) playing with the questionable composure sometimes displayed by Coughlin.\nThe Giants were called for 18 personal fouls in 16 games this season, the worst number of any team. The Jets had five, which was tied for the second-fewest in the league with five other teams.\nThe Jets were also one of five teams that did not incur an unsportsmanlike penalty during the regular season. Jets tight end Doug Jolley was called for one in a preseason game against the Giants, when he head-butted defensive back Sam Madison.\nAfter that game, a 13-7 loss, Mangini talked about Jolley's foul being ''really unacceptable'' and ''selfish.'' Within days, Jolley was gone, traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a seventh-round draft pick.\nIf the laps did not drive the message home about penalties, Jolley's banishment probably did. ''The coaches emphasize not making stupid penalties,'' Washington said, ''and being focused and committed to what we're trying to get done.''\nThere are at least two people with officiating experience at every practice, and at Mangini's behest, they call practice as tightly as any game crew. ''It is a significant emphasis,'' Mangini said.\nErik Coleman, the Jets' third-year safety, gave an assist to the practice officials for the feat the Jets pulled off of going nearly eight games this season without drawing a defensive pass-interference penalty.\nThe streak was snapped when safety Kerry Rhodes was called for interfering with Oakland tight end Courtney Anderson in the fourth quarter of the Jets' 23-3 victory last Sunday. ''I didn't think it was pass interference,'' Rhodes said, smiling.\nCorwin Brown, the Jets' defensive backs coach, said during a chance encounter in a hallway Wednesday that he was not aware of the streak. His players are positive that his fingerprints are all over their success.\n''Corwin's been working with us on being patient and calm when the ball is in the air and just looking at the receiver,'' the rookie cornerback Drew Coleman said. ''We call it not losing your moxie.''\nWhat does the moxie mantra cover? ''Playing with a little poise instead of getting rattled when stuff goes bad and getting all out of whack,'' Washington said. ''Just calming yourself.''\nMoxie by proxy: it is the Jets' way. The question to be answered Sunday is if the Mangini-mirroring Jets are disciplined enough to defeat a team that is heavily favored to beat them.\nEXTRA POINTS\nEric Mangini tried to make light Thursday of the cold-fish handshakes that he and his mentor, Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, exchanged after each of their regular-season meetings. ''We do a lot of self-scouting after the game: what we did well, what we did poorly,'' Mangini said. Breaking into a smile, he added that he thought his handshake was strong and firm. ''I've experimented with a couple other different kinds that haven't worked for me,'' Mangini said with a laugh. Center Nick Mangold did not receive any votes for offensive rookie of the year despite making 16 starts and few mistakes. But, Mangini said, ''He got center of the year for us.''\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816549	Times Co. Agrees to Sell TV Stations to Equity Firm	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400EEDC1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The New York Times Company has agreed to sell its nine local television stations to Oak Hill Capital Partners, a private equity firm, for $575 million.\nIn September, the Times Company announced that it would sell its Broadcast Media Group as it refocused its strategy on its newspaper and digital businesses. The deal, expected to close in the first half of this year, comes as the Times Company and other newspaper companies struggle to maintain advertising revenue and circulation.\n''Our focus now should be on the development of our newspapers and our rapidly growing digital businesses and the increasing synergies between them,'' Janet L. Robinson, president and chief executive of the Times Company, said yesterday in a statement.\nOak Hill Capital Partners, which was founded in the 1980s by Robert M. Bass and others, does not own other media assets. It is one of several private equity firms that have expressed interest in media properties lately.\nAdvertising revenue and circulation growth have suffered at the Times Company recently, as they have with many other newspaper companies, as consumers spend more time on the Internet. The company owns The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The International Herald Tribune as well as 15 local newspapers, 35 Web sites and 2 New York City radio stations.\nTotal ad revenue for the Times Company has been down more than 3 percent every month since July compared with the same month in the previous year, reversing gains in the earlier months of 2006. As of November, ad sales were down 0.8 percent for the first 11 months of the year compared with the period in 2005.\nThe Times Company reported in early December that its companywide ad sales were down 3.8 percent in November from November 2005.\nTimes Company stock closed at $23.34 yesterday, down about 14 percent from a year ago.\nIn late December, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating for the Times Company's long-term corporate debt from A- to BBB+.\nThe Times Company increased the prices that subscribers to The New York Times pay by 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 and increased the price of its Sunday papers in the Northeast. The price increases are expected to produce about $12 million in additional revenue a year.\nThe broadcast group has been a profitable part of the Times Company. The nine TV stations generated $139 million in revenue in 2005, about 4 percent of total revenue, and, according to a forecast issued in September, are expected to account for about $150 million in 2006, helped by political ad spending.\nThe Times Company acquired the nine stations, which have 900 employees, over the last 35 years, beginning with a station in Memphis in 1971. The company most recently acquired a station in Oklahoma City in 2005. Four of the stations are affiliated with CBS, two with NBC, two with ABC and one with My Network TV, which is owned by the News Corporation.\nThe Times Company is also selling one of its radio stations, WQEW, to ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, for $40 million. That deal is expected to close in the first quarter of this year.

1816552	White House Denies Switch In Mail Policy	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE6DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The White House said Thursday that President Bush was not claiming any new executive authority last month when he issued a statement suggesting that postal inspectors could open mail without a warrant in emergency circumstances.\nTony Snow, the White House spokesman, said the statement Mr. Bush issued in signing postal legislation was merely a restatement of existing law allowing mail to be opened without a warrant in ''exigent circumstances'' to protect public safety.\n''All this is saying is that there are provisions at law for, in exigent circumstances, for such inspections,'' Mr. Snow said. ''It has been thus. This is not a change in the law. This is not new.''\nThe questions arose after The New York Daily News published an article on Thursday drawing attention to the Dec. 20 signing statement and legal questions surrounding it. The front page featured a photo of Mr. Bush alongside the banner headline: ''Prez Goes Postal.''\nFederal law, in keeping with the constitutional prohibition on unreasonable searches, generally prohibits the government from opening first-class mail without a warrant. But a 1996 postal provision allows postal inspectors to open mail without a warrant in narrow circumstances if there is credible evidence that a package contains a bomb or other dangerous material.\nMr. Bush has drawn intense scrutiny and criticism from Democrats and groups like the American Bar Association for issuing signing statements reserving the right to disregard more than 800 selected provisions of measures that he signed into law, often on the grounds that they represented an unconstitutional infringement on executive authority.\nIn signing the postal legislation last month, Mr. Bush said that its restrictions on opening mail should be construed ''in a manner consistent, to the maximum extent permissible, with the need to conduct searches in exigent circumstances, such as to protect human life and safety against hazardous materials, and the need for physical searches specifically authorized by law for foreign intelligence collection.''\nMr. Snow said Mr. Bush had not claimed any ''sweeping new powers'' through the statement, as The Daily News article asserted, and the Postal Service issued a statement on Thursday echoing that assessment.\n''As has been the longstanding practice, first-class mail is protected from unreasonable search and seizure when in postal custody,'' said Thomas Day, a senior vice president for the Postal Service. ''Nothing in the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act changes this protection. The president is not exerting any new authority.''\nCritics were not so certain.\nSenator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, called Mr. Bush's signing statement a ''last-minute, irregular and unauthorized reinterpretation of a duly passed law'' protecting the privacy of mail users. The American Civil Liberties Union said it would press to find out how often mailings had been opened without warrants.
1816553	Police Training and Gun Use To Get Independent Review	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE6DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Responding to the shooting death of an unarmed Queens man by police officers nearly seven weeks ago, New York City's Police Department has commissioned a six-month independent review of its firearms training, of instances in which officers have fired their guns and of the phenomenon of so-called contagious shooting, the department's top official said yesterday.\nThe study, which police officials said was the first of its kind commissioned by the department, will be done by the RAND Corporation, a private nonprofit organization that has reviewed police practices in other major cities, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said. The announcement came amid continuing bitterness since the death of Sean Bell, who was killed in a hail of 50 police bullets in Jamaica, Queens, hours before his wedding on Nov. 25.\n''Questions have arisen as to the quality and effectiveness of our training'' Mr. Kelly said at a news conference. ''We thought it would be appropriate to bring in a recognized world-renowned nongovernment organization to take a look at all of our firearms training.''\nMr. Kelly said a team from RAND would assess five aspects of firearm use by police officers. They include initial, continuing and tactical firearms training, investigations of police-involved shootings, and situations in which shots fired by one officer spur other officers to shoot, a phenomenon that may have played a role in Mr. Bell's death.\nThe organization will delve into the details of shootings in which the police are involved, examining an officer's experience, the nature of the threat, the environment in which they fired their guns and other issues. Comparisons will be drawn to firearms training in other law enforcement agencies, Mr. Kelly said.\nRAND will not be looking into the death of Mr. Bell, which is under review by a grand jury in Queens, Mr. Kelly said.\nK. Jack Riley, the acting director of the RAND Center on Quality Policing, said the organization had previously evaluated training in the Los Angeles Police Department, investigated racial profiling among Oakland police officers, and examined ways to improve recruitment and retention among the police in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.\n''This is a very proactive step the N.Y.P.D. is taking,'' Mr. Riley said. ''I think there is an honest interest in having a dispassionate third party take an objective look at their training, and see if there's anything they're not getting right -- or can improve -- with regards to firearms training.''\nNews of the New York study, which will cost about half a million dollars and be paid for by the New York City Police Foundation, a charity that supports the Police Department, drew mixed responses from experts in firearms and police tactics.\nThomas A. Reppetto, a former president of the Citizens Crime Commission, said that bringing in an outside organization like RAND would likely inspire more public confidence, which has wavered of late, than an in-house Police Department review would.\nBut Dean Speir, who writes about firearms and tactics, asked why the Police Department had not undertaken such a review before, citing the death of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African immigrant whom officers shot at 41 times. Another expert suggested that the money would be better spent on hands-on tactical training.\n''If you talk to cops, they'll tell you people on the front line are starved for operational training,'' said Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\nBut Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for the department, said that one purpose of the review was to determine whether the current training needed to be revamped. He also noted that Mr. Kelly was not the police commissioner during the Diallo shooting.\n''What the commissioner wants is an independent assessment,'' Mr. Browne said. ''If the training needs to be improved, he wants an independent assessment of what improvements are needed.''
1816554	New Representatives From New York Region Take Office	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E5DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	One tucked photographs of two young constituents who had died fighting in Iraq inside the Bible he used to be sworn into office. Another held an open house in her new office here in the Capitol for the busload of supporters her staff invited from New York. And a third met with prominent liberals on a newly created ''bloggers' alley'' here and appeared on C-Span to introduce himself to a new national audience.\nIt was that kind of day for the crop of newly elected House members from the New York metropolitan region, as the 110th Congress convened on a largely ceremonial day that was filled with joy and awe.\n''I didn't believe I had won on election night, and it's still barely real,'' said Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat who represents New York's 20th District, surrounding Albany, as she stood outside the House chamber after casting one of her first votes. ''There have been only so many members of Congress in the history of the United States.''\nJohn Hall, the former singer with the band Orleans and a Democrat who captured the 19th Congressional District seat in New York City's northern suburbs, was similarly struck. ''It's exciting and it's humbling,'' he said, as he stood in line waiting to attend a ceremonial swearing-in at the Rayburn Room in the Capitol with the new speaker, Nancy Pelosi.\nIt was a day that promised to usher in a new direction for the nation, as Democrats took control of Congress for the last two years of President Bush's term. The day also involved the largest number of new faces in recent memory for the House delegations from the New York region.\nIn the November election, Democrats picked up at least five seats in New York and Connecticut, taking one open seat and defeating four incumbents who had been hobbled by their party's problems, chief among them President Bush's lagging popularity.\nDemocrats predicted that the power shift here would almost certainly enhance the fortunes of the New York region, a Democratic bastion whose entreaties for federal aid frequently fell on deaf ears in a Congress dominated by conservative Republicans from other regions.\nIn all, 34 of the 47 House members from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are Democrats (and the Republicans tend to be moderates whose positions on social issues like abortion have long put them at odds with conservative leaders of their party and thus less able to help their areas, even when their party was in power).\nAs Representative Nita M. Lowey, among the most influential members of the region's House delegation, put it on Thursday: ''We have been waiting for this moment a long time. We are in a position to deliver.''\nAmong the new members at the Capitol on Thursday was Joseph Courtney, who defeated a Republican incumbent, Rob Simmons, by slightly more than 80 votes in the Second District, in eastern Connecticut. As he waited for the ceremonial swearing-in, he clutched a 65-year-old Bible that belonged to his father. Inside it were photographs of two soldiers he knew who died in Iraq. He said he took the photos with him as a reminder of the awesome responsibility he was about to undertake.\nThere were jubilant celebrations across Washington, including a reception at the Rayburn Office Building for Mr. Courtney and another newcomer from Connecticut, Christopher S. Murphy, who defeated Nancy L. Johnson, a 12-term Republican incumbent, in the Fifth District, in the state's northwestern corner.\nIt was packed with gleeful supporters who came from Connecticut and munched on cheese and fruit, But the political significance of the day was not lost on Mr. Murphy, who ran on a platform of restoring ethics in Washington. He recalled walking past scaffolding as he entered the Capitol on Thursday morning and said that it reminded him of the enormous work that overhauling the ethos of Washington would entail for him and the other freshman lawmakers.\n''Every one of us came down here with a little different background and mandate,'' he mused. ''But I think the unifying theme of this freshman class is to change the culture and tone of this place,'' Mr. Murphy said.\n''We are here at a critical moment in our history,'' said Mr. Courtney, who has been critical of President Bush's handling of the war and who noted that he owed his own victory to voter disenchantment with the war. ''We have a huge challenge ahead of us.''
1816555	Gadflies Get Respect, and Not Just at Home Depot	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E5DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	For decades, activist shareholders were an entertaining, but largely ignored, Wall Street sideshow. Disgruntled investors would attend annual meetings to harangue executives, criticize strategies -- and protest that their complaints were being ignored. One agitator appeared in face paint and a red nose after executives called him a clown.\nToday, however, it seems that activists have captured the center ring and are directing the main event.\nOn Wednesday, shareholder advocates could claim one of their biggest prizes yet when Home Depot announced the resignation of its chairman and chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, long a target of shareholder ire for his large compensation and the company's flagging stock price.\nThe main investor who pressed for the overthrow at Home Depot might at first glance seem an unlikely rebel: Ralph V. Whitworth, a lawyer educated at Georgetown and a former campaign worker for President Ronald Reagan who in December announced he had bought about $1 billion of the retailer's stock, or a 1.2 percent stake, through his fund, Relational Investors.\nBut the rapid success of Mr. Whitworth's campaign against the management and strategy of Home Depot demonstrates how thoroughly activists have moved into Wall Street's inner sanctum. Mr. Whitworth has said he still intended to nominate himself and at least one other candidate to Home Depot's board at its shareholder meeting in the spring.\n''There's a lot more respect for investors like me now,'' said Mr. Whitworth, 51. ''I still have to make threats, but now everyone wants to deal with us fast. They realize we've got real power and we're here to stay. ''\nThe shake-up at Home Depot may be just a taste of things to come as shareholders and management at a number of companies, including Brink's, the Borders Group and Applebee's International, square off for battle at annual meetings this spring.\nAs those fights begin, expect few clown noses.\n''Activist shareholders have a power and audience beyond what they've ever enjoyed,'' said Howard Steinberg, a lawyer who advises corporate boards and deal makers. ''They're developing a credible track record, and as a result, more and more managers are forced to engage with them. Activists' time has come.''\nSince July, activists have pressed successfully to push out chief executives at Pfizer and Sovereign Bank. Institutional investors and mutual funds have set aside hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in underperforming companies with the intention of demanding new board seats or alternative strategies.\nMuch of that newfound influence is owed to recent legal changes and heightened attention to issues like executive compensation. But it also draws on the fact that many activists have now amassed the wealth, knowledge and networks critical for success.\n''For years these guys were seen as politically motivated oddballs or annoying attention seekers,'' said Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, a research group that rates corporate governance practices. ''Now some of those same people control hundreds of millions of dollars and have been around longer than many C.E.O.'s''\nBefore the 1980s, much shareholder activism was directed by ideological agitators, including unions, religious organizations and populist figures like Ralph Nader, who bought shares in companies as platforms for urging social, environmental or political changes.\nThe United Shareholders Associations, which Mr. Whitworth helped found in 1986 with the corporate raider Boone Pickens, was one of the first major efforts to organize shareholder activists around profit-minded goals.\nEvery spring the group would select about 50 companies and begin asking embarrassing questions at shareholder meetings. In 1993, the last year of the group's operation, 25 of 43 of the companies, including I.B.M, reached agreements with Mr. Whitworth.\n''The head of General Mills once called me a socialist,'' Mr. Whitworth said in an interview. ''I told him I was the ultimate capitalist. Business people would return my calls for the first time, and it was giving me an entree into a world I otherwise couldn't access.''\nForemost among the goals successfully sought by United Shareholders were regulatory changes that made it possible for dissidents to nominate only one or two directors to a board, rather than an entire slate.\nBy the mid-1990s, corporate raiders realized the rule offered a less expensive way to stage a takeover rather than buying a company outright. When the California Public Employees' Retirement System began looking for a fund that would use activism to increase returns in 1996, Mr. Whitworth and a colleague, David H. Batchelder, founded Relational Investors.\nThe fund today oversees about $7 billion, all invested in only nine companies that are chosen with an eye toward activist intervention. In most cases, Mr. Whitworth forces his way onto a company's board, either by threatening or staging a proxy fight. Investors say the fund has averaged a return of about 25 percent annually over the last nine years.\nActivist shareholders like Relational were further aided by changes in the law. In particular, they say that regulations passed in 2004 requiring money managers and mutual funds to disclose how they vote in proxy elections have forced once-passive managers to become activists.\n''There was a sense before that mutual funds in particular just voted with management,'' said Ann Yerger, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors. ''But post-Enron and Tyco, investors expect money managers to justify their votes now, and to be listening to anyone warning about dangers.''\nMoreover, money managers and hedge funds are beginning to advertise their activist intentions, bragging that aggressiveness gives them an edge. In November, the noted investor Robert A. Olstein announced formation of an activist fund.\n''We want to have an edge,'' said Eric R. Heyman, co-manager of the new Olstein Strategic Opportunities Fund. ''Our skill is approaching companies and persuading management to adopt certain decisions, sometimes aggressively, and that's why people invest with us.''\nAnother important shift is a court ruling last year making it easier for shareholders to challenge directors nominated by companies.\n''Shareholders' toolboxes are getting more and more robust every year,'' said Ms. Minow of the Corporate Library.\nMoreover, as the number of activist investors grows, a vast ad hoc network has formed that makes it more difficult for companies to win a fight. The universe of activist investors has expanded to include hedge funds like Pirate Capital, which is fighting to add its executives to the board of the security company Brink's, and investors like Carl C. Icahn, who failed to gain board seats after a public spat with Time Warner's chief executive, Richard D. Parsons.\nWhen two activist investors, Pershing Square Capital Management and Nelson Peltz, bought large amounts of stock in Wendy's International in 2005, many other like-minded buyers jumped in, according to analysts.\nAs a result, the board had no choice but to accept activists' suggestions, said James V. Pickett, Wendy's chairman. Ultimately, three representatives of Mr. Peltz's fund joined the board.\n''Most of the issues the activists raised at Wendy's were things we were already dealing with,'' Mr. Pickett said. ''They just increased the intensity. But when they own that much of the company, you have to listen to them even if you don't want to.''\nFor Mr. Whitworth, who has grown so wealthy that he once gave a charity $1 million in exchange for PaulMcCartney's playing at his wife's 50th birthday party, that kind of access has increased his effectiveness, he says.\nAfter forcing his way onto the board of Mattel, Mr. Whitworth was given a gold-plated Barbie in appreciation by other directors when he left.\nBut such shifts have also increased his ambitions.\n''I was a firebrand; now I've mellowed a lot,'' he said. ''But I'm still young. I look forward to helping a lot more companies become more efficient, whether they like it or not.''
1816556	Lilly Settles With 18,000 Over Zyprexa	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E5DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Eli Lilly agreed yesterday to pay up to $500 million to settle 18,000 lawsuits from people who claimed they had developed diabetes or other diseases after taking Zyprexa, Lilly's drug for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\nIncluding earlier settlements over Zyprexa, Lilly has now agreed to pay at least $1.2 billion to 28,500 people who said they were injured by the drug. At least 1,200 suits are still pending, the company said. About 20 million people worldwide have taken Zyprexa since its introduction in 1996.\nThe settlement covers cases filed in state and federal courts by law firms or groups of firms for 18,000 clients, Lilly said. The federal suits have been overseen in Brooklyn by Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Eastern District of New York.\nThe settlement will not affect continuing civil or criminal investigations of Zyprexa by state attorneys general and federal prosecutors.\nBoth Lilly and lawyers for plaintiffs said they were pleased with the agreement. With global sales of roughly $4.2 billion last year, Zyprexa is Lilly's largest-selling drug and a major contributor to the company's profits. Lilly shares were relatively flat after the settlement announcement. They rose 11 cents yesterday, to $52.36.\nZyprexa is the brand name for olanzapine, a potent chemical that binds to receptors in the brain to reduce psychotic hallucinations and delusions. Clinical trials show that in many patients, Zyprexa also causes severe weight gain and increases in cholesterol and blood sugar.\nDocuments provided to The New York Times last month by a lawyer who represents mentally ill patients show that Lilly played down the risks of Zyprexa to doctors as the drug's sales soared after its introduction in 1996. The internal documents show that in Lilly's clinical trials, 16 percent of people taking Zyprexa gained more than 66 pounds after a year on the drug, a far higher figure than the company disclosed to doctors.\nThe documents also show that Lilly marketed the drug as appropriate for patients who did not meet accepted diagnoses of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, Zyprexa's only approved uses. By law, drug makers may promote their drugs only for diseases for which the Food and Drug Administration has found the medicines to be safe and effective, though doctors may prescribe drugs in any way they see fit.\nIn response to questions about the information in the documents, Lilly has denied any wrongdoing and said it provided all relevant information to doctors and the F.D.A. Lilly has also said it did not promote Zyprexa for conditions other than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\nIn 2004, a panel of the American Diabetes Association found that Zyprexa caused diabetes more than other widely used antipsychotic drugs, in part because it tends to cause much more weight gain. But the F.D.A. has never made a similar finding. Instead, the F.D.A. added a warning in 2003 to the label of Zyprexa and other new antipsychotic drugs about their tendency to cause high blood sugar.\nIn 2005, a $700 million agreement covered 8,000 patients, and the company has made 2,500 individual settlements whose total value has not been disclosed, Lilly said. The 2005 settlement valued claims at about $90,000 a plaintiff, while yesterday's agreement values claims at about $27,000 a plaintiff, at most.\nThe lower value for the new claims comes in part because of the F.D.A. label change, which has allowed Lilly to say that it adequately warned doctors of the risks of Zyprexa after 2003. The label change may also help to protect Lilly from future lawsuits, analysts and lawyers say.\nIn its statement, Lilly said the settlement did not change its view that Zyprexa is a safe and effective treatment for mental illness.\n''We wanted to reduce significant uncertainties involved in litigating such complex cases,'' Sidney Taurel, Lilly's chief executive, said in the statement.\nRichard Meadow, one of the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs, said the deal was fair to both sides. ''Prolonging this litigation further is in no one's best interest,'' he said.
1816557	Ford, Lift Up Your Weary Head; The Family Name Is Woven Into the Fabric of Detroit	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E5DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	For a half-century, the blue oval logo atop Ford Motor's headquarters has served as a kind of beacon for the American automobile industry, a signpost for local motorists on area highways and a guidepost for pilots landing at Detroit's airport nearby.\nBut lately, blue is the only word for the malaise surrounding Ford, which is rapidly seeing its position in the industry and in its hometown eroded by its failure to combat foreign competition.\nThis year, Ford expects to permanently lose its grip on second place in the American market to Toyota, which passed it twice in monthly sales in the last six months, including December. As many as half its blue- and white-collar employees have decided to take voluntary buyouts from a company where jobs were long seen as lifetime guarantees.\nRon Cimino, 44, used to regret not landing a job at Ford, where his father worked for 52 years. Turned down in 1984 because he lacked a master's degree, Mr. Cimino of Dearborn wound up starting his own import-export business.\n''I'm glad I didn't end up working at Ford,'' he said. ''I never thought I'd say that.''\nTo be sure, General Motors and Chrysler have their own problems that are weighing on this city. Their headquarters are here, too, as are some of their car plants, and thousands of their employees have their own worries as each company struggles financially.\nBut Ford's troubles, arguably, are felt more acutely here. After all, G.M. placed a good bulk of its manufacturing 60 miles north, in Flint, Mich., and once had factories from Massachusetts to California as well as the Midwest. Chrysler, though still a big local employer, has had German owners for nearly a decade.\nFord, by contrast, is woven more into the fabric of Detroit, with the Ford name on office buildings, museums, high schools and highways, as well as the football stadium, Ford Field, which opened downtown in 2002.\nNow, as the annual Detroit auto show prepares to open to the media this weekend, much of this city's bedrock is unexpectedly at risk. In November, Ford disclosed it had pledged nearly all its assets, including the trademark on its 100-year-old logo, as collateral against $25 billion in loans needed to fund its restructuring.\nFord has generated a particular sense of sympathy, bewilderment and fear here that its crosstown rivals have not. There is sympathy, analysts say, because more of a human element is involved, namely the Ford family; puzzlement because Ford seemed to be the one Detroit auto company that had an answer for Japanese competition in the 1980s and 1990s with its profitable sport utility vehicles; and fear that if a once-powerful company like Ford could falter, no one in Detroit may be safe.\nThe sentiment is readily voiced in places like Miller's Bar, where the red leather barstools and colored Christmas lights evoke the watering hole in ''It's A Wonderful Life.'' It has been a Dearborn gathering spot since 1941.\n''Dearborn,'' said the owner, Mark Miller, ''is Ford.''\nJudy Dolan, a secretary for the Detroit Building Trades Council, said during an interview at her home, ''I feel horrible about the situation they're in.'' She drives only Ford vehicles in support of her hometown company.\nConcern over Ford's future bubbled up late last month in conversation at the holiday cocktail parties held by the Detroit and foreign car companies and their parts suppliers.\nGiven the attention to Ford's situation, the company's new chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, who arrived in September from the Boeing Company, is already recognized wherever he goes.\nMr. Mulally said in an interview that he was recently lost in a local supermarket when another shopper came up to him.\n''Oh, Mr. Mulally, we're so glad you're here,'' he recalled her saying, before she helped him find shampoo.\nHis predecessor was William Clay Ford Jr., who became the face of the company in television ads over the last four years as he struggled to fix Ford's problems (he remains chairman).\nThe family is the reason many company employees past and present refer to the automaker as Ford's. It is not a grammatical error, as visitors here might assume, but a nod to the fact that it is a company built by the original Henry and all the Fords that followed him.\n''The Fords have a relationship with the American people,'' said James P. Womack, the author and expert in manufacturing efficiency who advised Mr. Mulally at Boeing.\nThey include Kevin Boyle's retired father, also named Kevin, who immigrated to Dearborn from Ireland in the 1950s, drawn by the chance to work for a company founded by the most famous man in the auto business.\n''People came to Detroit with an intense connection with that name, and then their lives became tied up with that name,'' said Mr. Boyle, a professor of history at Ohio State who has written extensively about the automobile industry. ''It was a badge of honor to work for Ford.''\nNumerous families here boast multiple generations of Ford employees, some who worked on the assembly line, others -- fathers and sons, mothers and daughters -- who toiled in company offices. ''I started there when I was 19, and my whole family worked there,'' said Karen Kenniburg, who manages the vehicles driven by Ford executives.\nThe Fords, for their part, have given back, not just in jobs but also in charities. Guests at a Nissan holiday party last month at the New Detroit Science Center drank wine and munched crab cakes beneath a wall of donors dotted with names of various Fords. The same was true for Honda, whose event took place in an atrium outside Orchestra Hall.\nThat seeming omnipresence, however, makes the departures from Ford more poignant. Last month, more than 30,000 blue-collar workers accepted deals to give up their jobs.\nAbout half were ready to retire, but the rest were workers who did not have enough seniority to begin drawing pensions. They accepted payments of up to $140,000 apiece to leave.\nFord's white-collar employees are not exempt. The company has already cut 4,000 managers, and 10,000 more are set to go by spring. Last month, one of every three salaried employees was called in by their boss to be told Ford was giving them the opportunity for a buyout. If they did not accept, their jobs might not be safe, some were told.\nAltogether, more than 45,000 people, or half the number employed by the company at the beginning of the year, will not be working at Ford in 2007.\nThat is likely to hurt business at Miller's Bar, where 60 percent of the patrons work for Ford, and 18 of 25 cars in the parking lot on a recent afternoon bore Ford logos.\nOthers will be affected, as well. At a Starbucks on Michigan Avenue, a mile away from Ford's headquarters, and once a hangout for Mr. Ford, one customer, Shelley Boda, 32, said she was unable to land a job at the company, where her father, grandfather and numerous relatives worked.\nInstead, she chose the health care field, now less of a safe haven than she had hoped. With Ford cutting so many jobs, and the rich benefits that went with them, ''there won't be anyone here who can afford health care,'' she said.\nProfessor Boyle said Ford employees and the community were now realizing that what they thought was a ''safe bet'' was not.\n''The funny thing is, people didn't see it as a bet,'' he said. ''You would have parents who worked the line and have enough to send kids to college. They would go off and get engineering degrees, marketing degrees and work for the companies.\n''That has crumbled. There are few things more terrifying than that.''\nAnd yet, many still believe in the power of the Fords themselves to save their company. Ms. Kenniburg said they gave Ford an advantage over G.M. and Chrysler as they devise a comeback plan.\n''The Ford family,'' she said, ''they're going to do everything in their power to keep this company going.''
1816558	A Director Decides To Override A Friendship	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E5DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Everyone who knows him says it: In a tough fight, Kenneth G. Langone is a guy you want in your corner.\nBut when Robert L. Nardelli, the former chief executive of Home Depot, refused to bend to the will of an exasperated board and accept a pay cut, he lost the crucial support of a friend who as lead director not only recruited him but presided over his compensation contract that would later draw so much fire.\nFor Mr. Langone, a voluble man whose passions include Italian meatballs, golf and the Roman Catholic Church, it was a surprising reversal. Mr. Langone prides himself on his loyalty to his friends and, as a director who has served on the compensation committees of General Electric, Yum Brands and the New York Stock Exchange, he has never been shy about paying his chief executives well.\nNow, people who have spoken with him in recent days say, he is angry with Mr. Nardelli over his unwillingness to have his pay reduced.\nIn an era of escalating pay, with chief executives on Wall Street taking in $50 million a year and former General Electric executives like David Calhoun getting $100 million compensation deals from private equity investors, being paid well was a way for Mr. Nardelli, a scrappy former football player, to keep score.\nIn light of Mr. Langone's vocal and unyielding support for the $190 million pay package that was awarded to Richard A. Grasso, the former chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, he might have been expected to fight to the bitter end to save Mr. Nardelli.\nBut as friends who have served on boards with him say, beneath the bluster and occasional histrionics lies a more pragmatic man well aware of his fiduciary duties as a director -- especially at Home Depot, a company that he helped found and that has made him a billionaire.\n''Ken does not back down, but he also has a strong sense of propriety,'' said Gary E. Earlbaum, a real estate executive who introduced Mr. Langone to Bernard Marcus, a founder of Home Depot, more than 30 years ago. ''His loyalty is to the enterprise.''\nMr. Langone declined to comment. Mr. Nardelli did not return messages left for him.\nAt age 71, when many corporate executives start slowing down a bit, Mr. Langone continues to manage a full schedule of corporate, political, legal and philanthropic activities. He is a top financial supporter of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is weighing a possible run for the White House, and he is the chairman of New York University Medical Center. Mr. Langone also still devotes considerable time and energy to contesting the lawsuit brought against him and Mr. Grasso by Eliot Spitzer, the former attorney general for New York who is now the state's governor.\nThat's all in addition to his day job, running Invemed Associates, the small investment bank he founded.\nBut it has been his passionate and unstinting defense of Mr. Grasso's pay, much of which was set during his time on the exchange's compensation committee, that has come to define Mr. Langone's public image.\nHis detractors see him as a living symbol of the excesses of runaway executive compensation, a bullying old-school titan whose tendency to befriend his chief executives blinds any objective ability he might have had to keep a ceiling over their pay.\nMr. Grasso's huge compensation package, and, according to the lawsuit brought by Mr. Spitzer, his efforts to keep other directors in the dark about it, are perfect examples of this, they say.\n''Ken Langone is the root of the problem; his philosophy is that you can never pay a C.E.O. too much money,'' said Richard Ferlauto, the director of pension investment policy at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''That was revealed in his defense of Grasso. Now we are focusing on the role of Langone'' at Home Depot, he said. ''We blame him and his cronies for the original contract.''\nHis defenders, on the other hand, point to his long experience as a director and his acute knowledge of a director's responsibilities, honed from more than 30 years' experience as an independent investor. Yes, he has a big heart and an inclination to overpay at times, they say, but his ethics are beyond dispute.\n''I don't care what kind of a battle I'm in but I would want Ken Langone on my side, because he is on the side of honor and righteousness,'' said Frank Borman, a former director at Home Depot.\nMr. Langone's pursuit of Mr. Nardelli, whom he met in 1999, when he became a G.E. director, was infused with a sense of glee at the prospect of landing such a corporate star. Mr. Nardelli, well aware of the value of the G.E. pedigree, drove a hard bargain. A result was the 2000 contract, which, with its guarantees and perks, may well be an anachronism today as rich pay packages come under increasing scrutiny.\nAt Home Depot, Mr. Langone is a particularly involved director. He is chairman of the nominating committee and has played a significant role in shaping the current board. He is also a member of the executive and audit committees. He would frequently start his mornings with a call to Mr. Nardelli, and he thrilled in digesting the latest sales data as well as updates about Lowe's, the retailer's main competitor. And, while walking the floors at store outlets was a responsibility for directors, Mr. Langone did more than his share, as well as inspiring the Home Depot sales force at the frequent pep rallies he attended.\nStill, when it became clear that a combination of the poor performance of Home Depot's stock and Mr. Nardelli's obstinate demeanor had made his position untenable, Mr. Langone threw his support with the rest of the board.\nIn a 2004 interview for an article about Mr. Langone and his role in the Grasso controversy, Mr. Nardelli said: ''Change is difficult. But it is the only constant in today's environment. It takes courage and leadership.''\n''I think Ken stands by good business judgment.''
1816559	Gap Falters; Most Rivals Post Gains	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Gap's board, it appears, has had enough.\nAfter a dismal holiday season -- the third in a row -- the chain's directors are participating in a broad review of the company's strategy, intensifying pressure on the chief executive, Paul S. Pressler, to pull it out of a protracted sales slump.\nGap said yesterday that sales plunged 8 percent in December after a return to the simple fashions that fueled the chain's meteoric rise in the 1990s, like T-shirts and hooded sweaters, failed to lure customers back into stores.\nIn an admission that the back-to-basics approach has not worked, the company cut its earnings forecast for 2006, blaming deep discounts -- like $100 off a fur-lined parka -- required to sell left-over piles of winter clothing.\n''We are clearly disappointed,'' Mr. Pressler said in a statement.\nGap's results in December contrasted sharply with that of its competitors. The nation's retailers reported respectable sales increases for the month, according to several industry groups, even as warm weather hurt winter clothing sales and higher fuel prices pinched consumer spending.\nSales at stores open a year rose 3.1 percent in December, compared with the period in 2005, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, which predicted a 2.5 percent gain. For November and December combined, sales rose 2.8 percent, within the group's forecast.\nAs they have for much of the year, department stores like Saks (up 11.1 percent), Federated (up 4.4 percent) and J. C. Penney (up 2.6 percent) posted strong gains. But smaller clothing chains like Abercrombie (down 1 percent); Express, a unit of Limited (down 5 percent); and Ann Taylor (down 5.3 percent) struggled to stand out.\n''A lot of these retailers limped across the finish line,'' said John D. Morris, a senior retail analyst at Wachovia Securities, who speculated that bargains on flat-screen TVs captivated consumers in a season when there were few must-have fashions.\nWal-Mart, which heavily promoted flat-screen TVs, said sales rose 1.6 percent, beating its own predictions of a meager 1 percent increase.\n''Flat-screen TVs flogged fur-lined hoodies,'' Mr. Morris said.\nThere were plenty of those hoodies at Gap, which heavily discounted much of its winter clothing in the days immediately before and after Christmas. (The fur-trimmed parka, originally $169, was marked down to $68 several days before Christmas.)\nAs a result of the deep discounting, Gap profit margins for the fourth quarter will be ''significantly below'' those of last year, said Sabrina Simmons, senior vice president for corporate finance at the chain.\nThe board's decision to intervene in a review of Gap's brand strategies suggests that the directors are fed up with the chain's poor results and the executives who have failed, season after season, to turn it around.\n''This is a clear judgment coming down on the leadership of the Gap brand,'' Mr. Morris said.\nRevenue in December dropped 4 percent, to $2.34 billion, from $2.44 billion a year ago. The worst performance was at the Gap and Old Navy brands, where monthly sales dropped 9 percent and 10 percent, respectively.\nAs a result, Gap yesterday reduced its earnings forecast to 83 cents to 87 cents a share, down from $1.01 to $1.06.\nEven at Gap, which often describes its sales as ''disappointing,'' the December results appeared to jolt executives. The word ''disappoint'' was used at least four times yesterday in a prerecorded phone message and news release describing December sales.\nMr. Pressler said that he and the board would review brand strategies at Gap and Old Navy and that he was ''committed to making the necessary changes to improve performance.''\nBanana Republic will not be included in the review because that chain's sales are improving. As the division introduced pricier, preppier fashions, like an $88 silk-cashmere half-zip pullover, December sales rose 2 percent, making Banana a bright spot for the company.\nThe strategic review would be the second in the last year for the beleaguered Gap division, which has struggled to recapture business after several years of changing missions and fluctuating fashions.\nOver the summer, after months of brainstorming, Gap's brand president, Cynthia Harriss, introduced the back-to-basics strategy to investors and analysts, even bringing back the lower-case Gap logo used for the chain's first store in 1969.\nBut the trip down memory lane did not win over shoppers. ''We did not gain the traction we had expected,'' Mr. Pressler said.

Album sales declined almost 5 percent last year, to 588 million, as a doubling in sales of digital albums failed to compensate for a slide in CDs. The latest figures follow a 7 percent drop the previous year and come as the industry battles a host of challenges, including piracy, competing forms of entertainment and a paucity of new talent. Meanwhile the digital marketplace is not expanding as rapidly as many in the business had hoped. Sales of digital singles jumped 65 percent last year, to about 582 million units. More digital singles were sold than CDs for the first time. But the rise was not enough to offset the drop in full albums. The best-selling album of the year was the soundtrack to the Disney Channel movie ''High School Musical,'' with sales of more than 3.7 million copies. The best-selling digital song of the year was Daniel Powter's ''Bad Day,'' which sold more than 2 million copies.\nJEFF LEEDS

Late last month the museum and the Academy announced that they would match the price that the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark., had agreed to pay unless a local institution would pay an equal amount. The work will remain on view at the museum until early spring, when it will move to the Academy.\nCAROL VOGEL

With the film (which is rated R in the United States) scheduled to open today in Italy, Mr. Rutelli asked the distributor, Eagle Films, to send letters to theaters to ''discourage'' the entry of unchaperoned minors. Eagle responded by saying it would ask theater owners to exercise discretion but that no child would be denied admission.\nPETER KIEFER

The play, which cost a little more than $2 million and originally opened Off Broadway last winter at the Second Stage theater, will have played 22 previews and 112 regular performances at the Cort Theater on Broadway. The likely prospect to move into the Cort is ''Radio Golf,'' the last of August Wilson's 10-part play cycle on the black experience in the 20th century.\nCAMPBELL ROBERTSON

In the race for No. 2, CBS outdrew NBC, and both networks overshadowed the premieres on ABC. CBS's only new show of the night, ''The King of Queens,'' ranked second at 8 p.m. with 8.6 million viewers. It was followed by repeats of ''Two and a Half Men'' at 8:30 (8.5 million), ''Criminals Minds'' at 9 (11.9 Million) and ''CSI: New York'' at 10 (10.4 million). NBC was not far behind, getting a boost from ''Deal or No Deal'' at 9 (11.3 million) and ''Medium'' at 10 (9.3 million). Faring less well for NBC, ''Friday Night Lights'' earned 6.3 million viewers at 8. ABC was last over all, despite the season premiere of ''According to Jim'' at 8 (7.4 million). Neither of ABC's new comedies, ''Knights of Prosperity'' at 9 (7.2 million) or ''In Case of Emergency'' at 9:30 (6.3 million), fared better than fourth place.\nBENJAMIN TOFF
1816567	Cuomo to Review Spending on State Lawmakers' Pet Projects	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E4DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said Thursday that his office would review thousands of individual grants known as ''member items,'' the spending Albany lawmakers doled out for pet projects last year, staking out a potentially vast new front in efforts to reform the ways of the state capital.\nAnd moving to confront corruption in the upper echelons of state government, Mr. Cuomo also said he would promote the chief of his office's public integrity unit to special deputy attorney general, and promised a significant increase in the unit's staffing and resources.\nIn a brief but pointed speech here Thursday at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, Mr. Cuomo assailed the member-item spending as ''a visible, graphic illustration'' of the profligacy, secrecy and dysfunction that have characterized state government and dismayed voters in recent years.\nLast month, federal prosecutors accused State Senator Efrain González Jr., a Bronx Democrat, of stealing more than $400,000 in state money appropriated for charities in his district and using it for personal expenses. Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, is facing a federal investigation into some $500,000 in state grants he directed to Evident Technologies, a profit-making technology company in which a close friend of his was an investor.\nMr. Cuomo said that his office would review more than 6,000 member items that were approved last year to ensure that they met legal requirements for the spending of taxpayer money, and move to recover any state funds that were spent inappropriately. All future member items will face the same review, he said.\nTaking a cue from Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who has also made ethics reform the top priority for his term, Mr. Cuomo cast his effort as the Statehouse version of the financial-services prosecutions that made Mr. Spitzer famous when he served as attorney general.\n''As attorney general, Eliot Spitzer was successful in changing the way we did business on Wall Street,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''Now our challenge is to change the way we do business on State Street,'' he said, referring to the thoroughfare that runs alongside the Capitol.\nDick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group, said he and others would welcome the review.\n''Cuomo's push to ensure that there is merit and accountability behind the doling out of member items is a nice way to end a reform-filled week in Albany,'' Mr. Dadey said.\nCalled member items because many are proposed by individual members of the Legislature, the grants have a long but not always illustrious history in New York. The grants are distributed by both the Legislature and the governor, and many have been directed to the kinds of programs that traditionally attract government aid, such as legal services for the poor or AIDS education efforts.\nOther grants, however, have gone to fix up private hunting clubs and to the clubhouses used by ethnic fraternal organizations, like an Italian-American war veterans post that got money to make improvements to its kitchen.\nThe grants were once listed individually in the state's budget, where they could be examined by other legislators and the public. But in 1999, when then-Gov. George E. Pataki used his line-item veto to eliminate many items requested by Democratic lawmakers, the items were gathered into a lump sum, making them impossible to review and difficult to control. The more than 6,000 items in the last budget totaled about $200 million.\nIn his State of the State address on Wednesday, Governor Spitzer proposed that member items once again be listed in the budget individually, a step that both Mr. Bruno and Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, say they support.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Silver said Thursday that the speaker welcomed Mr. Cuomo's plans.\nUnder the state's Constitution, any program that receives state money must have a public purpose. The exact definition of ''public purpose,'' however, is the product of a multitude of legal decisions stretching back decades, and is relatively broad.\n''It would turn on what the actual use of the money is, but the presumption, if it went to a not-for-profit or a government, is that it's basically for a public purpose,'' Mr. Cuomo said. He also said that he thought a majority of member items served worthwhile purposes, and that he could not think of a member item that has in the past been found by courts or the attorney general's office not to have a public purpose.\nMr. Cuomo did not say whether he thought Mr. Bruno's grants to Evident Technologies would merit any action by his office, citing the federal investigation. ''At the conclusion of the criminal investigation, we will make our determination,'' he said.
1816568	New York State May Suspend Tests of New Voting Machines	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E4DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	New York State elections officials said on Thursday that they would consider suspending the testing of new voting machines in the state, after learning that the laboratory hired to perform the tests was temporarily barred by federal authorities last summer from accrediting new state voting systems.\nThe company, Ciber Inc. of Greenwood Village, Colo., is among the nation's top testers of voting machines. Ciber has a $3 million contract to help New York test proposed systems from five manufacturers to replace its aging lever machines.\nOfficials at the federal Election Assistance Commission delayed accrediting Ciber in July, after detecting problems in Ciber's quality-control procedures. The company has long been criticized by voting watchdog groups, but some state elections officials said on Thursday that they learned of the federal commission's decision only after details of it were published Thursday in The New York Times.\n''If we had known that, and if we had seen the report from them, we would have known why they were decertified, and maybe we wouldn't have hired them to begin with, or maybe we would have made some remedial changes,'' said Lee K. Daghlian, a spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections.\nMr. Daghlian said the board had requested a copy of a report prepared by the federal commission and would review it before making a final decision.\n''It may not delay use of the new machines,'' he said. ''If this report comes in and it's something really bad that we didn't know about, we may have to start all over again.''\nA spokeswoman for Ciber could not be reached for comment.\nThe potential delay was the latest setback for New York's efforts to comply with federal requirements that states modernize their voting systems to deal with concerns stemming from the 2000 election. The state has faced sanctions from the federal government for failing to comply with the new federal standards, which required new voting machines by last fall's elections.\nSince the state board established new and stringent voting machine standards in April, the process for acquiring new machines had been continually delayed, in part because machines being tested have failed to meet the new standards, said Bo Lipari, executive director of New Yorkers for Verified Voting, a state voting watchdog group.\nCiber has also been criticized by a second company, Nystec, which was hired to oversee Ciber's efforts.\n''I think what we're seeing now corroborates what Nystec has been saying, and that is that Ciber is not up to the task of testing voting systems in a way that protects the interests of voters,'' Mr. Lipari said.
1816569	Vincent Sardi Jr., Restaurateur and Unofficial 'Mayor of Broadway,' Dies at 91	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E3DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Vincent Sardi Jr., who owned and managed Sardi's restaurant, his father's theater-district landmark, for more than half a century and became, by wide agreement, the unofficial mayor of Broadway, died yesterday at a hospital in Berlin, Vt.. He was 91 and had lived in Warren, Vt., since retiring in 1997.\nThe cause was complications of a urinary tract infection, said Sean Ricketts, a grandson and manager at the restaurant.\nMr. Sardi ran one of the world's most famous restaurants, a Broadway institution as central to the life of the theater as actors, agents and critics. It was, the press agent Richard Maney once wrote, ''the club, mess hall, lounge, post office, saloon and marketplace of the people of the theater.''\nMr. Sardi understood theater people, loved them and was loved in return. He carried out-of-work actors, letting them run up a tab until their ship came in. (At one point, Sardi's maintained 600 such accounts.)\nHe attended every show and made sure his headwaiters did the same, so that they could recognize even bit players and make a fuss over them. At times, he exercised what he called ''a fine Italian hand,'' seating a hungry actor near a producer with a suitable part to cast.\nHe commiserated with his patrons when a show failed, and rejoiced with them when the critics were kind. He distributed favors, theater tickets and food, rode on horseback with the local police, and acted as a spokesman, official and unofficial, for the theater district.\nMr. Sardi was born on July 23, 1915, in Manhattan and spent his early childhood in a railroad flat on West 56th Street, where his parents took in show-business boarders. In 1921, his father took over a basement restaurant in a brownstone at 246 West 44th Street. He named it the Little Restaurant, but theater people called it Sardi's, and so it became.\nThe family lived upstairs. When the building was razed in 1927 to make way for the St. James Theater, Sardi's moved to its current location, at 234 West 44th.\nVincent Jr., whom his father called Cino, attended Holy Cross Academy on 43rd Street. He got a taste of the theater at an early age, appearing as Pietro, an Italian urchin, in ''The Master of the Inn'' at the Little Theater when he was 10. The play closed quickly, but not before Vincent learned about the subtleties of the actor-director relationship. When he pointed out that an Italian would say ''addio,'' not ''adios,'' he was told to keep his opinions to himself and read the line as written.\nIn 1926, the Sardis moved to Flushing, Queens, where Vincent graduated from Flushing High School. He entered Columbia University intending to become a doctor, but failed the chemistry examination, in part because, short of pocket money, he had sold his textbook at Barnes & Noble so he could attend a dance. He transferred to Columbia Business School and earned a degree in 1937.\nIn the meantime, he began working in the family business on weekends, earning $14 a week. ''My duties included stints at the cigarette counter, shifts at the cash register and a few attempts at being a Saturday headwaiter in the upstairs second-floor level,'' he recalled in Playbill.\nHe also learned how to cater to Sardi's unusual clientele. When Broderick Crawford was appearing in ''Of Mice and Men,'' Vincent was volunteered to take the actor's Doberman for its nightly walk.\nMr. Sardi spent two years learning the food-service business at the Ritz-Carlton before rejoining Sardi's in 1939 as dining-room captain. That year he married Carolyn Euiller. The marriage ended in 1946.\nIn 1942 he joined the Marine Corps, which took one look at his résumé and assigned him to run the bachelor officers' mess at the Cherry Point Air Station in North Carolina. The next year he was sent to Okinawa, where he supervised a rest camp. He left the Marines as a captain. In 1946, he married Adelle Rasey, an actress. That marriage, too, ended in divorce.\nIn 1947 Vincent Sr. retired, and Vincent Jr. took over the restaurant, buying it from his father. Sardi's was already renowned as a place where deals were made, gossip circulated and actors and producers made it their business to see and be seen. ''The restaurant had a central place in the theater,'' said Gerald Schoenfeld, the president of the Shubert Organization. ''You could walk in at lunch and do a day's business, see people you hadn't seen in a long time. You didn't think of going anywhere else.''\nMr. Sardi, a tall, affable man with a military bearing, perfected the art of seating enemies far apart and putting friends and potential allies near one another. ''He was always the soul of politesse, but where he seated you could be crucial to making a deal,'' said the producer Arthur Cantor.\nMr. Sardi also knew how to keep temperamental actors happy. ''You've got to be awfully careful with actors out of work,'' he told an interviewer. ''They're very sensitive about their fading prestige, and I know darn well they scrimp to come in here, on the chance that they'll be considered for a part. Boosting an actor's ego with a table in a good location is simply my way of giving him a pat on the back.''\nWhen he was not running the restaurant, Mr. Sardi raced cars, played polo and skied. He was also president of the Greater Times Square Committee in the 1960s and the Restaurant League of New York in the 1970s.\nIf Sardi's was a club, its rules were mysterious. Only Mr. Sardi knew them, and only he could explain why, for many years, one of the best tables was held for Mr. and Mrs. Ira Katzenberg. The Katzenbergs, who by the early 1950s had attended virtually every Broadway opening for 30 years, took their seats at Sardi's at 7:15 and ordered, without fail, a brandy and a bottle of Saratoga water. Mr. Sardi called them his favorite customers.\n''People like them keep the theater alive, and the theater is their life,'' he said. ''The least we can do is give them the best table in the house.''\nMr. Sardi could do nothing about the autograph hounds and the photographers who crowded around the entrance. But inside the front doors, his word was law. Diners were not to be disturbed.\nSardi's shone brightest on the opening night of a Broadway show, and in the 1960s, a show opened nearly every night. The ritual never varied. In a line that stretched down 44th Street, theatergoers, theater insiders and celebrity watchers clamored for a table, hoping against hope to be seated on the first floor, where they could see cast members, producers and the playwright of the moment entering the restaurant after the curtain rang down. As the actors made their way to their tables, the diners would stand and applaud.\nOnce seated, the actors, producers and playwright would put on a brave face waiting for the reviews. The first 25 copies of The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune were rushed over to Sardi's from the printing presses at midnight, with the review pages marked. Mr. Sardi would man the telephone, taking calls from friends of the cast, ticket brokers and newspaper columnists eager to get a read on the fate of the new play. If the reviews were poor, a pall descended over the dining room, and diners would slink out the door. If the reviews were good, it was Champagne all around and a celebration until the wee hours.\n''All of us on the staff were caught up in each Broadway play,'' Mr. Sardi wrote in Playbill. ''We became involved in the raising of money, the casting of roles, the progress of rehearsals, and, after opening night, the success or failure of a play.''\nIn 1946, hoping to capture some of the excitement of Sardi's, the radio station WOR created ''Luncheon at Sardi's,'' an hourlong program in which the host moved from table to table, microphone in hand, interviewing celebrities. In 1949, the show spawned a television spinoff, ''Dinner at Sardi's,'' which failed to catch fire. The celebrities had a bad habit of using their air time for shameless self-promotion.\nUndeterred, Mr. Sardi appeared as himself in two television dramas in the mid-50s, ''Catch a Falling Star,'' on ''Robert Montgomery Presents,'' and ''Now, Where Was I?'' a CBS production. He also turned out a cookbook, ''Curtain Up at Sardi's'' (1957), which he wrote with Helen Bryson. It included, of course, the restaurant's signature dish, cannelloni with Sardi sauce, a homey curiosity in which French crepes were stuffed with ground chicken, ground beef, spinach and Parmesan cheese, then topped with a velouté sauce enhanced with Hollandaise, sherry and whipped cream.\nBy the late 1950s, Sardi's was grossing about $1 million a year, and in 1958, looking to expand, Mr. Sardi opened Sardi's East, at 123 East 54th Street.\nMr. Sardi threw his all into the new venture. He arranged for theatergoers to be taken to Broadway on a London double-decker bus. He hired out-of-work actors as conductors. He lured his father out of retirement and installed him as manager. Sardi's East never caught on, however, and Mr. Sardi sold it in 1968.\nBy the 1960s, the Times Square area was deteriorating, the theater district was becoming more dangerous and the vibrant world of culture that had nourished Sardi's entered a period of decline. To make matters worse, in 1974, Mr. Sardi embarked on a ruinous venture, opening a 700-seat dinner theater in Franklin Square, on Long Island. The theater burned money for two years before closing.\nAt Sardi's, critics complained, standards seemed to be slipping. ''Those who go to the restaurant to observe celebrities will rarely be disappointed,'' Mimi Sheraton wrote in a 1981 review for The Times. ''Those who go for good food that is well served will rarely be satisfied.''\nGradually, Sardi's became a tourist destination. The lunchtime business evaporated. The restaurant was showing its age. In September 1985, Mr. Sardi sold it for $6.2 million to two producers from Detroit, Ivan Bloch and Harvey Klaris, and the restaurateur Stuart Lichtenstein. They announced plans to bring back the old luster and open up a Sardi's restaurant, hotel and casino in Atlantic City. Instead, they fell behind on payments, declared bankruptcy and closed the restaurant in June 1990.\nMr. Sardi, who had planned to spend a tranquil retirement in Vermont, resumed ownership of Sardi's in 1991. He gave it a facelift, leaving intact the 700 or so caricatures of theater people that hang on the walls. He also brought in serious chefs, who gradually improved the quality of the food, although Sardi's, even in its heyday, never owed its reputation to its kitchen. As his health declined, Mr. Sardi spent less and less time at the restaurant, turning its operation over to his partner, Max Klimavicius, who will continue to run the business, a restaurant spokesman said yesterday.\nMr. Sardi is survived by his wife, the former June Keller; three children, Paul, of Coco Beach, Fla.; David, of San Diego; and Tabitha, of Manhattan; a sister, Anne Gina Sardi of Stamford, Conn.; nine grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. A daughter, Jennifer, died earlier.\nThe family plans to hold a memorial service at a date to be announced but at a location that is certain: Sardi's.\nCorrection: January 10, 2007, Wednesday An obituary on Friday about Vincent Sardi Jr., who owned and managed the Broadway landmark Sardi's restaurant for more than half a century, misstated the year in which he was on Okinawa as a member of the Marines helping to supervise a rest camp. It was 1945, after United States forces had taken control of the island, not 1943.
1816570	Award Validates Pennington	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E3DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Chad Pennington does not have to be standing in the pocket to draw attention. Pennington, the Jets' quarterback, faced a dogged rush last Sunday when he and a few teammates gathered at a Japanese restaurant near the team's practice facility to celebrate receiver Laveranues Coles's 29th birthday. Pennington was attracting so much attention, Coles said he finally stepped in and said, ''Hey, it's my day!''\nThat is the way the spotlight shines in the N.F.L., where the quarterback tends to receive an inordinate amount of credit when a team is successful and too much blame when it is not.\nPennington, whose arm strength and ability has been widely questioned throughout his seven-year pro career, saw the strength of his character validated Thursday. After coming back from two career-threatening rotator-cuff surgeries on his throwing shoulder to start all 16 games for the 10-6 Jets, Pennington was honored as the Associated Press's N.F.L. comeback player of the year.\n''Understanding the journey that I've been through thus far makes it special,'' Pennington said, referring to the award. ''Knowing that hard work does pay off and that having the right attitude and believing in working hard and treating people right and doing your business the right way actually matters.''\nPennington completed 64.5 percent of his throws during the regular season while passing for a career-high 3,352 yards. After his second surgery, in October 2005, it was by no means a given that he would play another down, much less 16 games.\nThe 30-year-old Pennington spent much of the winter and spring in the trainer's room having his shoulder treated while he pored over the playbook with his good (nonthrowing) arm. In training camp, Pennington, who started 37 regular-season games in his first six years with the Jets, had to win back his starting job.\nHe absorbed that blow to his ego as well as a financial hit -- the Jets restructured his contract so that his salary was tied to his performance.\n''Sometimes during the rehab and sometimes during the competition I think I had to look at it as if the slate was wiped clean and what I had done in the past doesn't matter anymore,'' Pennington said. ''If this situation did anything for me, it showed me how important staying in the present, staying in the now, is. Because that's the only part of your life that you can control.''\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816571	Life Shaped by Tragedy, Built on Resolve	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E3DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The tragedies happened long ago, nearly three decades, but an emotional callus has yet to fully form for the man over a boy's wound. Jeff Garcia's retellings are both matter of fact and wistful. They are spoken without tears but with hints of how unimaginable loss has contoured a life and a career now being celebrated here for unexpected victory.\nGarcia said he was 7 years old in the late 1970s when his 6-year-old brother, Jason, drowned during a family camping trip in northern California. When Jeff was 8, his 5-year-old sister, Kimberly, tumbled out of the bed of a truck and sustained fatal head injuries.\n''I think I'm very conscientious of how precious life is and how quickly life can be taken away from you, especially at times when it can be least expected,'' Garcia said Wednesday in a brief interview.\n''To experience that personally with family tragedies, it's one of those things where I really value where I am today and everything I've been able to achieve,'' he said. ''And I think it's created so much gratification within my family and so much satisfaction within myself.''\nWith Garcia at quarterback, the Philadelphia Eagles (10-6) have won five consecutive games to take the National Football Conference East and to earn a home playoff game Sunday against the Giants (8-8). It is the most unlikely and cherished of seasons for Garcia and the Eagles, who seemed finished after Donovan McNabb tore a ligament in his knee in November.\nYet again, resolve has overcome expectation for Garcia.\nHe was unsigned by any major college out of high school; undrafted out of San Jose State; untethered from San Francisco after three Pro Bowl seasons with the 49ers; unwanted by many N.F.L. teams after backwater seasons in Cleveland and Detroit; unforeseen to do much in Philadelphia as a backup; and unappreciated by many fans here until losing turned into winning.\nBut here he is, at age 36, on the cover of Sports Illustrated, a poster boy for fiery grit and doggedness, a remade player on a revived team that kept tilling a fallow season until it blossomed with hopes for the Super Bowl.\n''I don't think he understands the word no,'' said John Lango, the coach at Gavilan College in Gilroy, Calif., Garcia's home town, and an assistant coach for a season during Garcia's days at Gilroy High.\n''Jeff has said that sport is really what kept the family together after all this tragedy,'' Lango said Thursday in a telephone interview. ''I think that's what's driving him. That and his fiery desire. People have said, 'The family will never overcome this,' or 'He's not big enough to play Division I.' There has always been a negative thing that he has used as a positive thing.''\nLast month, Garcia, who has two younger sisters, spoke more expansively about his wrenching family history to Philadelphia reporters. Not only did he lose a younger brother and sister, he said, but before he was born, his parents lost a set of premature twins. His brother, Jason, had been his best friend. Jeff was left angry and confused. Why did one family have to suffer so much? Why didn't he die instead of his brother?\nThe Garcias did not seek counseling, he said. Instead, sports became the family bond.\n''Part of my growing up was always trying to make my parents proud and always trying to keep them happy,'' Jeff told local reporters, adding, ''I think part of what held them together was my involvement in sports.''\nBob and Linda Garcia, Jeff's parents, did not return calls seeking comment, but their excitement over his accomplishments can be heard on their answering machine: ''The Eagles are flying high! Oweeee!''\nIt can be a heavy burden, trying always to please someone else, to shoulder their hopes. Jeff used similar words Wednesday in speaking of Philadelphia's faithful and fickle fans, who once booed him and now are cheering him. ''In no way do I want to let them down,'' he said. ''In no way do I want to disappoint them.''\nSo far, he has not.\nRelying on familiarity with the West Coast offense, precise timing, an accurate and soft touch and gut instinct, Garcia has guided a team that found balance and ballast after losing five games out of six in a midseason slump. He has thrown 10 touchdown passes and only two interceptions since replacing McNabb.\n''He's playing every bit as well as when he was in his prime,'' said Marty Mornhinweg, Philadelphia's offensive coordinator who held a similar position in San Francisco when Garcia played there.\nNot long ago, Philadelphia's season was dismissed as a failure. Prematurely, it turns out. Garcia, along with running back Brian Westbrook and safety Brian Dawkins, have led the Eagles into the playoffs with momentum and a lack of the fractiousness that soured the team a year ago after a corrosive feud between McNabb and Terrell Owens.\nApart from being teammates who play the same position, Garcia and McNabb have in common a mercurial history with Owens. Both succeeded by relying on his receiving skills -- McNabb here, Garcia in San Francisco -- and both have been strafed by his incendiary words.\nIn August 2004, during his first training camp after being traded to the Eagles, Owens suggested that Garcia was gay. At the time, Garcia said he would not respond to ''ridiculous, untrue allegations.''\nHe has since become engaged to Carmella DeCesare, Playboy's 2004 playmate of the year. Garcia has made it a point to appear with her this season when he has been a guest on a Monday night sports program on local cable television.\nGarcia said Wednesday that Owens's remarks had been hurtful, especially to his father, who had coached Jeff at Gavilan, the junior college in his hometown.\n''Yeah, it hurt me, but I told my dad, 'We just need to move past it,' '' Garcia said.\nMove past it. This has become a career mantra for Garcia.\nWhen no major college wanted him out of high school, he went first to junior college. When the N.F.L. did not want him, he played for five seasons in the Canadian Football League and won the 1998 Grey Cup. When the 49ers, the Browns and the Lions no longer wanted him as a starter, he found a spot as a backup in Philadelphia.\n''He's the toughest guy I've ever been around, pound for pound,'' said John Ralston, who coached Garcia during his senior season at San Jose State.\nAs he has since high school, Garcia displays a fierce passion evident in the way he pumps his fist, shouts encouragement, springs up after a hard tackle, occasionally head-butts a teammate and kisses one on the helmet.\n''I've never seen a quarterback as fired up as him,'' tight end L. J. Smith said. ''From high school on.''\nUltimately, it is an intensity forged, in part, from tragedy.\n''I can't feel the things he felt from those incidents,'' Mornhinweg said of Garcia. ''However, I do know that he's very, very tough physically and very, very tough mentally. He's been through a lot, both in his personal life and his football career. He's had some ups and downs, and he's come out the other end, and it may very well have made him stronger.''\nOf course, there are still melancholy moments. Last month, Garcia became emotional as he described to Philadelphia reporters the close bond between him and his brother, Jason, telling how they did everything together -- wrestled, played soccer, everything.\n''I still think about if we all would have grown up together, that we all would have been in high school at the same time and it just would have been a fun life,'' Garcia said atthe time. ''Who knows if I would be where I'm at today, but I would give this up for him to be here with me.''\nIf time and distance can never bring complete healing, they have brought context and perspective. A defeat to the Giants on Sunday would hurt, but losing a football game is not the end of the world, Garcia said Wednesday, no matter how devastating it can feel at the moment.\n''If this is the worst that we're going to experience in our lives, then we're living pretty good lives,'' he said.\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816572	Taliban Leader Is Said to Promise More Afghan War	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E3DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	In what appears to be the first exchange with a journalist since going into hiding five years ago, the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, said that he had not seen Al Qaeda's chief, Osama bin Laden, in five years and that he would never negotiate with the United States-backed government of Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan. He also threatened to continue the war until foreign troops withdraw from Afghanistan.\nThe statements were made in written response to questions sent by e-mail to the Taliban spokesman, Muhammad Hanif, who often speaks to journalists by telephone from an undisclosed location. Mr. Hanif said that Mullah Omar had written the replies himself and that a courier had returned the answers on a USB computer drive.\nThough it was impossible to verify those claims, the statements, if authentic, would be Mullah Omar's first exchange with a journalist since he was driven from power in 2001 by the American-led invasion of Afghanistan. The fugitive Taliban leader, who claims to be at large in Afghanistan, is widely thought to have taken up sanctuary in Pakistan.\nSince fleeing his last stronghold in the southern city of Kandahar in December 2001, Mullah Omar said that he had not seen or tried to contact Mr. bin Laden, and that although his movement did not have a specific alliance with Al Qaeda, they were fighting for the same goals.\n''I have neither seen him nor have made any effort to do so, but I pray for his health and safety,'' he said of Mr. bin Laden. ''We have never felt the need for a permanent relationship in the present circumstances. But they have set jihad as their goal, whereas we have set the expulsion of American troops from Afghanistan as our target. This is the common goal of all the Muslims.''\nAsked about the suicide bombers who have carried out over 100 attacks in Afghanistan in the last year, he said they were acting on religious orders from the Taliban. ''The mujahedeen do not take any action without a fatwa,'' he said, meaning an Islamic edict. ''They seek fatwas before they take any action in their self-defense.''\nHe denied receiving any outside assistance, and dismissed as Western propaganda that Pakistan was providing assistance and a safe haven to his movement. ''We have not received any assistance so far, nor can anybody prove that,'' he said. ''The leadership, resistance and shura are all based here in Afghanistan.''\nHe dismissed Mr. Karzai's effort to convene a grand assembly between Afghan and Pakistani elders and leading representatives to try to forge peace between the nations as a conspiracy by American intelligence agencies. ''Only those people who have sold out to foreign forces will participate,'' he said. ''Our participation is absolutely out of question.''\n''First of all, foreign troops should leave Afghanistan and then the institutions they have created should be dismantled,'' he said. ''Unless that happens, the war will heat up further. It will not decrease.''\n''The people themselves have risen up to fight the Americans,'' the statement continued. ''Nobody can tolerate this kind of subjugation and sacrilege of their culture and religion. It would be humiliating for anybody to think that the nation does not want to evict American forces. No nation can accept the dictates of a handful of dollar-greedy and treacherous people.''\nIn his replies, he showed himself unrepentant for his refusal to give up Mr. bin Laden to the United States after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and for blowing up the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan in March 2001.\n''Our stand to grant refuge to Osama bin Laden was based on principles,'' he said. ''If there were people who were opposed to us giving refuge to him, they should have done so with logic and reason, and not using bullying or threats,'' he said. The council of clerics, which was the highest authority of the Taliban government, asked Mr. bin Laden to leave, but never had any intention to force him out, he said. ''The clerics had declared jihad against the United States in total opposition to his surrender to the Americans,'' he said.\nAsked if the Buddhas' destruction was a mistake in retrospect, he said: ''Shariah is Shariah. There is no distinction on whether a certain thing is difficult or easy. A certain number of Muslims have been influenced by other civilizations, and that's why they seem to find Islamic injunctions too difficult.'' Shariah is the legal code of Islam based on the Koran.\nHe repeated the same justification that his government had used previously for its harsh strictures that closed girls' schools and forbade women to work, namely that his government was still fighting a war and could not do everything at once.\n''Girls' schools were either too few or were nonexistent before we took over,'' he said. ''We were preparing a strategy for girls' education in accordance with the Shariah.''\nHe blamed the anti-Taliban forces of the Northern Alliance and international sanctions for preventing his government from achieving its aims.\n''We could have formed a real government had we achieved full and total control over the whole country, and we did manage to run the government in an organized manner with the blessing of Shariah and divine laws,'' he said. ''But if there were problems, those were largely because of the conspiracies of the infidels and foreign enemies, for instance, the impositions of sanctions on Taliban, organizing anti-Taliban forces and preparing them to fight the mujahedeen.''

1816574	Players' Off-Season Regimens Are as Different as Their Swings	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E1DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	After Christina Kim struck her final golf shot last season, she suddenly had a number of options at her disposal for the off-season.\nShe could fly to her ancestral South Korea, where yoga, acupuncture and long runs along snow-covered footpaths comprised her off-season program a year ago.\nBut she could also stay in Orlando and continue to break in her new six-bedroom house, complete with an indoor putting green, a 60-inch flat-screen television and stacks of Renè Caovilla shoes.\nEventually, she decided to stay home.\n''It's the ultimate bachelor pad,'' Kim said. ''I haven't left the house for a month.''\nKim is one of the hundreds of golfers on the L.P.G.A. and the PGA Tours whose off-season regimens are as unique as the golf swings they employ. With no spring-training games, mandatory minicamp practices or training-camp two-a-days, a professional golfer disappears for the winter and reappears months later on the first tee. [The PGA Tour season began yesterday at the Mercedes-Benz Championship in Hawaii; the L.P.G.A. Tour season also starts in Hawaii, Feb. 15 at the SBS Open at Turtle Bay.]\nHow golfers spend their off-season is entirely up to them, and it is up for review on an annual basis.\nSome golfers put their clubs away for weeks after the final tournament. Some use the time off to open their own golf courses, which is what Phil Mickelson and Davis Love did in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Some golfers receive boxes full of new clubs to test, from titanium drivers guaranteeing the most distance, to putters promising a truer roll on the green.\nAlmost all of the golfers head out to a driving range in long-sleeved shirts, looking for answers in the dirt and dew.\nTiger Woods said the weakest part of his game at the end of last season was driving. To address it, he spent part of his off-season testing several new drivers, including a square-shaped driver called Sumo.\n''I do hit it further but launching it a little high,'' said Woods, who will make his 2007 PGA Tour debut at the Buick Invitational on Jan. 25. ''That's what the off-season is for, to try to dial it in.''\nOnly days after competing at the season-finale Tour Championship in November, Vijay Singh was on the golf course at the T.P.C. at Sawgrass with two golf bags attached to his golf cart. For several hours he worked his way through the bags, sending an array of wood and iron shots into the distance.\nIf there is a universal truth among golfers, it is that the off-season is often the ideal time to try new clubs and new approaches.\n''That's when I'll tinker,'' Joe Ogilvie, a PGA Tour golfer, said in a recent telephone interview. ''I've changed the driver, 3-wood, 5-wood and all my irons. Once the season starts, the only thing I'll change the entire year is my wedges,'' he said, because the grooves of the wedges tend to get worn down during the season.\nKim also called the off-season ''the best time to change clubs.''\n''Whether you've had a great season or a crappy season, you start fresh,'' she said. ''I don't know how people can change clubs during the season. I see some girls changing three times a year. So much about golf is about trust. If you're used to hitting a club 150 yards and you get a new one and it goes 180, you're in trouble.''\nThe most common thread of a golfer's off-season is the workout program, though the amount and intensity vary from player to player. Kim's trek to South Korea at the end of the 2005 season was the talk of the L.P.G.A. Tour. She shed more than 30 pounds on the trip.\n''I went over there to train and try to lose a winter coat I've been wearing for the last 20 summers,'' she said at the time.\nKim woke up at 5 a.m. every day to run, eventually working her way up to nine miles. She attended yoga classes and saw an acupuncturist. She met with massage therapists and a dietician. She said she also hit about 700 balls a day, which burned even more calories.\nShe began the 2006 season by joining five of her L.P.G.A. Tour peers at two Academy Awards after-parties.\nBut when tournament play started, her game suffered. After winning a tournament in 2004 and 2005, she did not win in 2006.\n''It felt like my worst season ever,'' Kim, 22, said. ''It was an embarrassing situation for me. I had lost a lot of weight, and it affected my mental game. I'd be standing over a putt and it'd be: 'Oh, I can see both of my feet now. One sock is higher than the other. There is a spot of lotion on my leg.' ''\nWhen the season ended, Kim started to replay the shots of her season, especially the ones that cost her victories and higher finishes.\nShe reviewed the Women's British Open at Royal Lytham and St. Annes in particular, the tournament where she finished tied for 45th after a final-round 83.\n''On two par 3s, two shots that I thought I hit perfectly, I walked off with an 8 and a 9,'' Kim said. ''Those are the shots that wake you up and the shots you have nightmares about. Some people say that it's karma when you hit a good shot and it rolls into a pot bunker. I don't remember doing anything so bad to make a 9.''\nThe season was tough enough that Kim decided that she needed a little extra time away from the game this off-season. She kept her clubs on ice for a little longer than she did last year before finally driving over to Lake Nona Golf and Country Club on a late December afternoon and hitting some balls.\nShe wore a bright outfit of purple and fuchsia and quickly found her rhythm on the range. Soon she will be chasing Annika Sorenstam and Lorena Ochoa, Karrie Webb and Paula Creamer, but there is also a house to furnish.\n''Everybody needs a break from golf, I don't care who you are,'' said Kim, who plans to make her season debut next month in Hawaii. ''I want to let the golf bug come back a little stronger.''\nAs for her goals once the off-season is over and her year begins?\n''I want to be the youngest player to get to $3 million,'' Kim said, ''and then Paula can get it a week later.''\nGOLF

1816576	Scoreboard Shows This Isn't Same Old Ohio State	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The first tangible sign of how drastically Ohio State shifted its offensive philosophy came from the opponent's sideline.\nOn Nov. 13, 2004, in a game at Purdue, the normally conservative Buckeyes began the game with five-wide-receiver sets, then ran option pitches to the receivers.\nA team whose tradition revolved around power football suddenly began running around like a maverick team from the Western Athletic Conference.\n''I don't think you can print the words that we were saying on the sidelines,'' Purdue's defensive coordinator, Brock Spack, said in a telephone interview. ''It was nothing that we expected. They really caught us off guard.''\nOhio State lost that day, but the Buckeyes have won 24 of their 26 games since, their only losses coming in the 2005 season to Texas and at Penn State. The overhaul in Ohio State's offensive philosophy underscores one of the themes heading into the Bowl Championship Series title game Monday in Glendale, Ariz.: Ohio State and Florida this season belie their programs' reputations.\nFlorida, the team where the so-called Fun'n' Gun preceded Coach Urban Meyer's spread-option offense, has won primarily because of a strong defense and opportunistic special teams. Ohio State, where Woody Hayes and his coaching descendants had long worshiped power football, has won with a diverse, wide-open offense under Coach Jim Tressel.\n''When I heard they were doing that, I said, 'Man, has football changed,' '' Florida's defensive coordinator, Greg Mattison, said. ''I can remember lining up against them and saying, 'This is the 15th iso that you're going to get.' ''\nThe iso is football parlance for an old-fashioned run into the line. Mattison saw Ohio State run plenty of them during a stint as an assistant at Michigan.\n''That's where football has changed,'' Mattison said. ''You can't line up and just hammer people anymore.''\nOhio State wide receiver Anthony Gonzalez said he remembered walking off the field after that loss to Purdue in 2004 and saying to himself: ''We're going to be fine. We're going to be just fine.''\nHe was right. The Buckeyes have gone 12-0 this season and mastered an offense that can be considered one of the most electric in college football.\n''They lost the battle that day but won the war,'' Spack said of Ohio State's loss to Purdue. ''It was a really good move on their part.''\nSince that day, 3 yards and cloud of dust has turned into 18 yards and a trail of vapor.\nThe Buckeyes are averaging 409.75 yards a game, which puts them No. 16 nationally according to the latest N.C.A.A. rankings. They are scoring 36.33 points a game, good for sixth. The scoring average put them in the same neighborhood as Brigham Young, West Virginia and Louisville, teams known for wide-open offenses.\nCompare that with 2004, when a clunky offense prompted Ohio State to switch to the spread with three weeks remaining in the regular season. The Buckeyes finished No. 98 nationally in total offense with 320.83 yards a game and No. 71 nationally in scoring offense. Their total offense average put them in the same echelon as Kansas, Ball State and Indiana, teams known for losing a lot of games.\nGonzalez said he remembered that Ohio State's offensive coaches were criticized throughout the 2004 season, in which the Buckeyes finished 8-4 and defeated Oklahoma State in the Alamo Bowl.\n''What a difference two years makes,'' Gonzalez said. ''All of the talk was about the offensive coaches not having imagination or being creative enough. But the reality was that we weren't very experienced.''\nThe main factor that led to Ohio State's philosophy shift was talent. Quarterback Troy Smith had his breakout game against Michigan the week after the loss to Purdue.\nFrom there, he developed into the Heisman Trophy winner and the leader in this offense. The new offense made better use of wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr., who has evolved into one of the country's most dangerous offensive threats. Gonzalez, who was a sturdy possession receiver, developed into one of the most versatile and reliable receivers in the country.\nAn offense in which punting and pinning the other team deep were part of the game plan for years suddenly became stocked with all-Americans and became known as the Fun Bunch.\n''As our talent has grown and evolved, changed a little bit, I think we've tried to do a good job utilizing the people that we have,'' the offensive coordinator, Jim Bollman, said. ''And that will continue to be that way for as long as we are coaching.''\nFOOTBALL

Vlad the Impaler was presumably expected to impale someone now and then. Bob the Builder would be demoted to mere Bob if he didn't occasionally build something.\nThis should concern Cedric the Entertainer, whose artless performance deadens what could have been a much funnier comedy, ''Code Name: The Cleaner.'' He hams his way through the title role so clumsily that some game supporting performances -- most notably by Lucy Liu and Nicollette Sheridan as two delicious pieces of arm candy -- are wasted.\nC. the E. -- darn it, what is the proper second reference? -- plays a man who wakes up in a hotel room with a dead guy and a briefcase full of cash, and can't remember anything, including his own name. He might be a secret agent or he might be a janitor -- Les Mayfield, the director, and Robert Adetuyi and George Gallo, the scriptwriters, try (not very successfully) to keep you guessing.\nMs. Sheridan soon turns up, saying she's the amnesiac's wife, and Ms. Liu checks in as an apparent girlfriend, but neither is what she seems. Everyone is eager to get hold of a missing computer chip.\nThis could have been a wry parody of the ''Bourne'' movies, but the script isn't savvy enough, and the Big Man's performance isn't subtle enough. So it ends up being something at which a grown-up could safely drop a 13-year-old, rather than something parent and child would both enjoy. (Commendably, it's relatively benign as these types of movies go, if you don't count a scene with Ms. Sheridan wearing not too much lingerie.)\nThe standout is DeRay Davis as a janitor with hip-hop aspirations; in the film's one memorable scene, he begs an agent to shoot him to improve his rap credentials. It makes you wish Mr. Davis had been given the lead.\nNEIL GENZLINGER\n''Code Name: The Cleaner'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) because Ms. Sheridan looks criminally good in underwear.\nMovie Review | 'Code Name: The Cleaner'
1816578	Film in Review; Happily N'Ever After	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E0DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Opens today nationwide Directed by Paul J. Bolger 87 minutes\nAnyone who dismisses the ''Shrek'' movies as lowbrow junk should see ''Happily N'Ever After,'' a cartoon feature that apes those films' visuals, soundtrack choices and rude jokes, while throwing away their sweetness and conviction.\nLike Dreamworks' ogre comedies, ''Happily'' is a grab-bag parody set in a fantasyland derived from bedtime stories and Disney films. The adopted chambermaid Ella (voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar, drawn like Winona Ryder) and the poor dishwasher Rick (Freddie Prinze Jr.) battle Ella's wicked stepmother, Frieda (Sigourney Weaver).\nFrieda has seized control of the kingdom's Department of Fairytale-Land Security, a surveillance tower in which a wizard (George Carlin) and his hapless, runty, nonhuman minions (Andy Dick and Wallace Shawn) monitor the kingdom's continuing narratives (Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin, etc.).\nThat's a good setup. Unfortunately, the filmmakers are content to repeat fairy-tale tropes in a smug directorial voice. Worse, unlike ''Shrek'' -- which countered Disney's 19th-century aesthetic by insisting that morality defines beauty, not the other way around -- ''Happily'' regurgitates retrograde attitudes while pretending to criticize them.\nDespite self-aware touches -- including Mr. Prinze's resentful, smart-aleck narration and a sight gag in which the film seems to slip free of its sprockets -- this is another tired kidsploitation product in which a wasp-waisted ingénue and a shallow beau (whose boy-band looks make him a redundant alternative to Patrick Warburton's predictably vain and oafish prince) drive the plot and live happily ever. The stepsisters are cardboard gold diggers, the stepmother a haughty shrew who's not fit to wield the wizard's magic staff.\nPotentially lively backup characters -- kindly sous-chefs in toadstool-shape hats; bipedal wolves with ''Sopranos'' accents; plump butch witches on jet-propelled brooms -- get stuck with the usual options: Serve the pretty ones or get lost.\nRoot for the stepmom.\nMATT ZOLLER SEITZ\n''Happily N'Ever After'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for rude jokes and mild innuendo.
1816579	2 More City Heroes, and One Child Saved	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E0DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The two men first saw the baby from across the Bronx street, dangling from a fire escape four stories above the sidewalk. His grip was growing weaker by the second. The two men saw only one choice: run over and try to catch him.\nThey positioned themselves below, arms out. The little boy fell. He glanced off a branch of a tree that was brushing against the fire escape. Then he bounced off the chest of one of the men, who was knocked off balance and could not grab him.\nBut he landed safely in the arms of the other man, who managed to hold on tight.\nAnd so yesterday, the two men -- longtime friends who had been looking over a used Honda that one was thinking of selling and the other was thinking of buying -- became the second and third good Samaritans of the new year, not even a week old. The rescue came two days after another New Yorker flung himself onto the subway tracks to save a 20-year-old film student who had fallen from the platform.\n''This is a week of heroes here in New York,'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said later yesterday.\nThe two men -- Julio Gonzalez, 43, a mechanic who lives in the neighborhood, and Pedro Nevarez, 40, of Corona, Queens -- insisted that they had just done the obvious thing. As Mr. Nevarez, who has a 19-year-old foster son, put it: ''I'm not a hero. I did what any other father would do. When you're a father, you would do this whether it's your child or not.''\nBy then, a crowd of reporters and residents of the East Tremont neighborhood was swirling around them, and someone said, ''If you're not a hero, how about an angel without wings?''\nMr. Nevarez simply smiled. Mr. Gonzalez said, ''I feel I did something good.''\nThe baby, identified by the police as Timothy Addo, 3, was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was treated for minor scrapes and was released, a hospital spokesman said.\nBefore long, a man who said he was Timothy's great-uncle returned from the hospital to the apartment building at 2105 Daly Avenue, near East 180th Street, and showed the crowd a photograph of Timothy after his tumble, taken with a cellphone. The boy had what appeared to be a bandage on his head, but looked as if he was enjoying the attention. The police said that Timothy had been in his baby sitter's apartment on the top floor of the five-story building, and that there were no window guards. He crawled onto a radiator and from there, onto the fire escape, they said.\nLast night at the 48th Precinct station house, the police were questioning the baby sitter, identified by law enforcement officials as Carol Baldwin, 50. It was not clear if any charges would be filed against her.\nRicky Serra, 31, said his daughter Alesha, 1 1/2, was also in Ms. Baldwin's apartment when Timothy climbed out the window. Ms. Baldwin also watches Mr. Serra's 4-year-old daughter, Adriana, after school. He said he would not send the girls back to her.\n''That could have been my baby,'' he said, referring to Timothy. But he added that Ms. Baldwin could not have foreseen that Timothy would play with the window.\nTimothy's mother, Katrina Cosme, 26, was at work when the boy clambered out the window. Going step by step on the fire escape, he managed to work his way down one floor as passers-by below took notice.\nSome screamed for help. Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Nevarez sprang into action, dashing toward the fire escape even though Mr. Gonzalez was not sure that the little object on the fire escape was a child. ''I thought it was a toy or something,'' he said later.\nAt first, he told Mr. Nevarez to run inside the building and pull the child back in. But the door was locked. Mr. Gonzalez realized that there was no time, and called his friend back. Mr. Nevarez said he tried to grab the bottom rung of the fire escape, hoping to climb up and carry the baby into the building. But the fire escape was too far off the ground.\nThey took their places under the fire escape just as Timothy lost his grip. Mr. Nevarez said Mr. Gonzalez told him: ''Stay right next to me. We're not going to let him hit the floor.''\nFirst, the boy bounced off Mr. Nevarez. He said Timothy knocked the wind out of him, and also knocked him down.\nMr. Gonzalez then realized that it was up to him. ''I just hoped and prayed that I would be able to catch him,'' he said.\nHe did. ''He came down hard,'' Mr. Nevarez said. ''He only weighed 45 pounds, but it felt like he weighed more than a hundred.'' They wrapped him in Mr. Nevarez's jacket and waited for help to arrive.\nA neighbor, Migdalia Melendez, 43, said that Ms. Baldwin, the baby sitter, was standing behind the ambulance as the paramedics closed the doors, and that Timothy reached for her. Ms. Melendez said Ms. Baldwin put her arms around Timothy and said, ''I was only in the bathroom for a second.''\nMs. Melendez said she had been in her living room on the second floor when she heard people screaming and saw Timothy on the fire escape. She ran outside, as did her husband, Luis.\n''Don't blame the baby sitter,'' he said. ''She's a good woman.''\nAnother neighbor, Kyiesha Johnson, 19, said that she had known Ms. Baldwin from childhood and that Ms. Baldwin had looked after children in the building for years. If parents had to go to the store, Ms. Johnson said, the baby sitter kept tabs on their children.\n''She always tended to the kids perfect,'' Ms. Johnson said.\nTimothy's mother, Ms. Cosme, arrived at the building a couple of hours after the excitement. She hugged Mr. Gonzalez and cut through the crowd. Last night, she told television reporters that she was grateful.\nAfter the police arrived, Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Nevarez gave each other a high-five. That was when Mr. Nevarez realized that his hand was sore from landing on it when he was knocked down. His chest also felt sore. But he decided that he did not need medical help.\nHe and Mr. Gonzalez have known each other since they were 9 and 6, respectively, Mr. Nevarez said. They grew up on 174th Street in the Mount Eden section of the Bronx and have kept in close touch over the years.\n''We were in the right place at the right time,'' Mr. Nevarez said. ''If we hadn't been there, we'd be talking about how the kid across the street fell out of the house and died.''
1816580	After Blocking Tower, Neighbors Recoil at Void in Hell's Kitchen	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E0DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Community groups in Hell's Kitchen fought one of the city's most powerful developers to a standstill a year ago, blocking his attempt to build a 60-story tower over a new home for Cirque du Soleil.\nSince then, neighbors have complained that the rubble-strewn, 1.5-acre site on 42nd Street, between Dyer and 10th Avenues, has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes in the summer and cockroaches, rats and other vermin year-round.\nIn the latest skirmish, Fred Papert, who built Theater Row nearby, filed a lawsuit yesterday against the developer, Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of Related Companies, saying the site had become an eyesore.\nMr. Ross appears to be considering a new plan for the site, possibly with a hotel, luxury apartments and shops. The plan also includes two small theaters that community groups and leaders want.\nAfter meeting with elected officials in December to discuss complaints about the site, the developer installed floodlights along the blue construction fence on 42nd Street and periodically picked up the wind-swept garbage around the parcel.\nBut the problem has gotten to the point where it is cutting into business, said Glenn Isaacs, the manager of the Travel Inn, west of Related's site, and the owner of the Theater Row Diner, at Dyer Avenue and 42nd Street. ''Our hotel guests are coming back to the hotel saying it's dangerous,'' Mr. Isaacs said. ''There's rats, mice, garbage all over the place.''\nYesterday, a worker was pumping the stagnant rainwater that gathers in an eight-foot-deep hole on the site into a nearby sewer drain. The city's health and buildings departments found a series of violations last year relating to water that accumulates every time it rains. Some residents call the site ''Lake Related.''\nMr. Papert's lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, involves more than a dollop of revenge from a figure who was Mr. Ross's ally in acquiring the parcel. It seeks $500,000 in damages and says that the health and safety conditions at the Related site, which sits ''at the epicenter of a renewed and thriving neighborhood,'' are hurting the whole community and undermining property values.\nA new plan could be in the works for the site. According to a real estate executive who has been briefed on the developer's plans, Related wants to form a joint venture with an unnamed hotel operator to build a 60-story, one-million-square-foot tower. The tower, with a hotel and luxury apartments at the top, would sit above shops, an Equinox gym and a couple of small theaters.\nBut Jeff T. Blau, the president of Related, said ''there's no deal at the moment.''\nHe added, ''We're exploring everything, given the Cirque deal not happening.''\nHe said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment.\nThe city and the community wanted Related to replace the two Off Broadway theaters it had demolished. ''Nothing would make us happier than if Related did what they originally promised us they would do,'' said Mr. Papert, president of the 42nd Street Development Corporation. ''The minute we know it's going to happen, we'll withdraw the lawsuit.''\nTherein lies the story.\nIn 2004, Related was one of two developers vying for the site. Mr. Papert, who owned a minority interest in the land, helped steer the deal to Related. In the 1980s, Mr. Papert and his nonprofit group replaced several massage parlors on 42nd Street between Ninth and Dyer Avenues with Theater Row, a collection of small Off Broadway theaters. But they were unable to do the same thing on the next block.\nMr. Papert said he helped Related buy the land for about $107 million, because he understood that the developer would find a new home for the theaters in his proposed tower. Indeed, Related talked to city officials about an apartment building that would house two small theaters and a performance space for classical musicians.\nRelated, in turn, would have been able to take advantage of a city zoning regulation, a ''theater bonus,'' to build a taller tower than would have normally been allowed. But the company ultimately proposed to build an 1,800-seat theater for Cirque du Soleil, the human circus extravaganza. That plan was opposed by officials who argued that the bonus was intended to nurture struggling theater companies, not an economic blockbuster like Cirque.\nThe city's Planning Department ruled last February that the project did not qualify for a bonus. Related then put the parcel up for sale, asking about $350 million. But no one was willing to go that high.\nMarisa Redanty, president of the tenants' association at Manhattan Plaza, which sits across 42nd Street from the site, said yesterday that Mr. Papert's lawsuit was premature. But, she added, the company is trying to clean up the area.\n''If they do not continue to make the site more community-friendly, then all options are open,'' Ms. Redanty said. ''And if they give us the theaters, I'm happy as a clam.''
1816581	Massachusetts Swears In First Democratic Governor in 16 Years	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E0DB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	In a ceremony rich with gestures of openness and symbols of conquering adversity, Deval L. Patrick, the first black governor of Massachusetts, took his oath of office on Thursday. He promised far-reaching changes in attitude and policy and asked people to ''see our stake in each others' dreams and struggles as well as our own, and act on that.''\nIn the state's first outdoor inauguration, part of four days of events intended to include people across the state, Mr. Patrick, the first Democratic governor here in 16 years, said, ''For a very long time now we have been told that government is bad, that it exists only to serve the powerful and well-connected, that its job is not important enough to be done by anyone competent, let alone committed, and that all of us are on our own.''\n''Today we join together in common cause,'' he said, ''to lay that fallacy to rest.''\nMr. Patrick takes over from Mitt Romney, a Republican, who is planning to run for the presidency, and already Mr. Patrick has revealed many positions that oppose Mr. Romney's. The former governor did not attend the inauguration.\nMr. Patrick has said that he will restore $383.6 million in budget cuts made by Mr. Romney to social services and other programs, that he will reverse the former governor's agreement authorizing the state police to arrest illegal immigrants, and that a Romney-endorsed effort to remove some Massachusetts Turnpike tolls is unrealistic.\nMr. Patrick also said he might revoke some of the 200 11th-hour appointments Mr. Romney made to boards and commissions.\nAnd, while Mr. Romney strongly backed a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, Mr. Patrick spoke out strongly against it this week, even as the legislature gave it first-round approval.\nWhile the legislature is heavily Democratic in this heavily Roman Catholic state, many Democrats are more conservative than Mr. Patrick on issues like same-sex marriage. He also faces a budget deficit of about $1 billion. And it will not be easy to put into effect the state's new health insurance reform.\n''I've never seen a governor who has such high expectations on him as Deval Patrick,'' said Jeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University. ''Democrats regard him as something of a demigod. They expect him to be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound and pay for social services.''\nPaul Watanabe, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, said: ''I think he's going to find that governing is a lot more challenging than being a candidate. And that the demands placed upon him by large numbers of individuals -- a record number of people that voted for him -- are going to be difficult to meet.''\nMr. Patrick also faces criticism over his inauguration celebrations. While much was inclusive -- the open-air ceremony, a town-meeting-like ''youth inaugural'' for students, and upcoming ceremonies in five other cities -- there was also a gala whose cost was paid for largely by corporate donors, who were allowed to give up to $50,000 each.\nAt the inauguration itself, however, on one of the balmiest January days in memory, the tone was full of possibility, pride and humility. In a state where the legacy of busing and segregation still stings, Mr. Patrick, reared in poverty on the South Side of Chicago, took the oath on a Bible given to John Quincy Adams by Africans from the Amistad slave ship whom Adams had helped free.\nFour previous Massachusetts governors were present, as was L. Douglas Wilder, the former governor of Virginia and the only other black since Reconstruction to have been a governor.\nThe populist timbre, and the high expectations of Mr. Patrick, were sounded early, with a benediction by Rabbi Jonah Pesner describing the multicultural electorate and the problems of poverty, violence and discrimination.\n''Behind every face hides so many secrets -- painful secrets of suffering,'' Rabbi Pesner said, urging the governor and the people to create ''a commonwealth rebuilt, repaired and redeemed.''\nAmong the crowd was Derward Jacobs, 60, who is disabled and who drove his scooter to the State House because ''I felt like I should be here.''\nGeorge Greenidge Jr., 35, leader of an alliance of black colleges, said, ''Today is a beacon of hope.''\nMr. Greenidge added that Mr. Patrick had ''re-engaged a constituency that really never was involved in state politics, especially people from lower economic backgrounds.''\nBeth Gilbert, 52, of Norfolk, Mass., acknowledged the steep demands that confront Mr. Patrick, saying, ''When you elect a Republican governor, part of their bargain is they don't really believe that government can solve the people's problems. That's probably what's led to higher expectations here.''\nMr. Patrick signaled he was aware of the difficulties.\n''I am an optimist, but not a foolish one,'' he said. ''I see clearly the challenges before us.''\nHe added: ''Change is not always comfortable or convenient or welcome. But it is what we hoped for, what we have worked for, what you voted for, and what you shall have.''
1816582	Bush to Name A New General To Oversee Iraq	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804EFDB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	President Bush has decided to name Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus as the top American military commander in Iraq, part of a broad revamping of the military team that will carry out the administration's new Iraq strategy, administration officials said Thursday.\nIn addition to the promotion of General Petraeus, who will replace Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the choice to succeed Gen. John P. Abizaid as the head of the Central Command is expected to be Adm. William J. Fallon, who is the top American military officer in the Pacific, officials said.\nThe changes are being made as the White House is considering an option to increase American combat power in Baghdad by five brigades as well as adding two battalions of reinforcements to the volatile province of Anbar in western Iraq.\nMr. Bush, who said Thursday that he would present details of his overall strategy for Iraq next week, and several top aides held a video teleconference on Thursday, speaking with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq and his top deputies about plans to add forces in the capital and other matters. The session lasted roughly an hour and 45 minutes.\n''I said that 'You show the will, we will help you,' '' Mr. Bush told reporters.\nEchoing the comments of both military and political advisers in recent weeks, he added, ''One thing is for certain: I will want to make sure that the mission is clear and specific and can be accomplished.''\nSenior administration officials said that the choice of General Petraeus was part of a broader effort to change almost all of the top American officials in Iraq as Mr. Bush changes his strategy there.\n''The idea is to put the whole new team in at roughly the same time, and send some clear messages that we are trying a new approach,'' a senior administration official said Thursday.\nIn addition to the military changes, Mr. Bush intends to appoint the ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, as the new United States ambassador to the United Nations, a senior administration official said Thursday.\n''It was clearly time to move the players around on the field,'' said the senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because Mr. Bush had yet to announce the changes. ''This helps the president to make the case that this is a fresh start.''\nAdmiral Fallon would be the first Navy officer to serve as the senior officer of the Central Command, which is managing simultaneous ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Admiral Fallon is regarded within the military as one of its stronger regional combat commanders, and his possible appointment also reflects a greater emphasis on countering Iranian power, a mission that relies heavily on naval forces and combat airpower to project American influence in the Persian Gulf.\nGeneral Petraeus, who is now the head of the Army's Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., helped oversee the drafting of the military's comprehensive new manual on counterinsurgency. He has served two previous tours in Iraq, and some former officers say he sees the need for additional troops in Baghdad.\nHe will replace General Casey, whose plan for troop reductions in Iraq faltered last year in the face of escalating sectarian strife and who initially expressed public wariness about any short-term increase in troops in Iraq, a move that is now a leading option under consideration by the White House.\nThe departures of both General Casey and General Abizaid were expected, though in General Casey's case it appears to have been moved up several months from the originally anticipated shift in spring or summer. General Abizaid's tour had already been extended for a full year beyond the typical two-year stint, and he has announced that he will retire soon.\nThe troop increase option under discussion would focus on improving security in Baghdad. Under this approach, two Army combat brigades would be sent to the capital during the first phase of the operation. A combat brigade generally consists of about 3,500 soldiers. At the same time, a third brigade would be positioned in Kuwait as a reserve, and two more brigades would be on call in the United States.\nThe expectation is that these three brigades would eventually be sent to Baghdad as well, though the president would have the option to limit the reinforcements. Part of the increase could be achieved by holding some units past their currently scheduled return home.\nScaling up by five brigades would more than double the number of American combat troops involved in security operations in the Iraqi capital. The emphasis on Baghdad reflects the view that stability in the capital is a precondition for any broader effort to bring calm to the whole country. It is also a recognition that the administration sees sectarian violence as a greater threat to Iraq's stability than the Sunni Arab insurgency.\nWhile Baghdad is the principal focus, the option also provides for sending two battalions of reinforcements to Anbar, where overstretched Marine and Army forces have been battling Sunni Arab insurgents. A basic battalion generally consists of 1,200 troops.\nOne issue under discussion is how to mesh the emerging American strategy with the Iraqis' capabilities. Bush administration officials say they want the increase in American troops to be paralleled by a considerable rise in the number of functional Iraqi troops. But the Iraqis failed in the summer to send all the reinforcements that had been requested, and some Iraqi security forces, particularly the police, have been infiltrated by militias.\nAnother point of contention is that some senior aides to Mr. Maliki have been notably unenthusiastic about an increase in American troops in Baghdad. During his meeting with Mr. Bush in Jordan in November, Mr. Maliki presented a plan that would shift most Americans to the periphery of Baghdad so they could concentrate on fighting Sunni insurgents while the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government asserted more control over the capital. That has left some American officials wondering whether the Maliki government was making a legitimate bid to exercise sovereignty or is committed to a sectarian Shiite agenda.\nBush administration officials believe that their new Iraqi strategy must involve political steps toward reconciliation and reconstruction programs to produce jobs.\nIn their teleconference, Mr. Bush and Mr. Maliki discussed the Iraqi government's efforts at political reconciliation and the Iraqi prime minister's vows to rein in militias, the pace of which American officials have found painfully slow. Discussing the execution of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush said the Maliki government was right to investigate the circumstances surrounding the hanging.\nGeneral Petraeus participated in the initial invasion of Iraq as the commander of the 101st Airborne Division. The division fought its way toward Baghdad and was later sent to Mosul in northern Iraq, where the general focused on political and economic reconstruction efforts.\n''We are in a race to win over the people,'' read a sign in his Mosul headquarters. ''What have you and your element done today to contribute to victory?''\nGeneral Petraeus did a second tour in Iraq in which he oversaw the efforts to train the Iraqi Army. At his current post at Fort Leavenworth, he has been involved in the push to change the United States Army's training and education to emphasize counterinsurgency operations.\nJack Keane, the retired Army general who served as vice chief of the Army, called General Petraeus an ''imaginative commander who is experienced and knows how to deal with irregular warfare,'' as the Army refers to insurgencies.\nThe Iraq commander post is considered a four-star general's command, a promotion that would add a star to General Petraeus's shoulder.\nOfficials also said Admiral Fallon received a persuasive recommendation from the Joint Chiefs as one of the military's stronger commanders of a geographic theater, with his current command including the challenges of North Korea and China.\nIn that capacity, he also took the unusual and punitive move in December of canceling a large, annual field exercise with the Philippines over a local judge's failure to honor the bilateral treaty governing protections for American military personnel. The judge refused to honor the agreement's rule that American military personnel remain in American custody pending final appeal of all criminal proceedings against them, and ordered a marine convicted of rape held in a local jail even though the case was on appeal.\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ
1816583	Jubilant Democrats Assume Control on Capitol Hill	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EFDB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	In a day of transition and pageantry, exultant Democrats on Thursday took control of both houses of Congress for the first time in a dozen years and elected the first woman to be speaker of the House.\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California took the speaker's gavel at 2:08 p.m. from Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, whom she defeated by a vote of 233 to 202, the 31-seat margin of the new Democratic majority. The floor and the packed galleries erupted in cheers when the vote was announced.\nEven Republicans grudgingly acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the day on which a woman ascended to power on Capitol Hill by rising as one to applaud her.\n''This is an historic moment,'' Mrs. Pelosi said in her first remarks as speaker of the 110th Congress. ''It's an historic moment for the Congress. It's an historic moment for the women of America. It is a moment for which we have waited for over 200 years.''\nEarlier in the day, on the other side of the Capitol dome, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, became majority leader, a result of his party's one-seat victory margin in the November elections.\nBoth Senator Reid and Speaker Pelosi promised a new era of cooperation after years of partisan passion and gridlock. ''Guided by the spirit of bipartisanship,'' Mr. Reid said, ''Democrats are ready to take this country in a new direction.''\nThe House opened the session by passing, by a large bipartisan margin, new ethics rules. [Page A13.]\nBut there were signs, too, of division among Democrats over how hard to push to undo the fruits of years of Republican rule. Many Democrats say those years moved the nation too far right, but others argue that the big tax cuts and regulatory relaxations are part of the permanent legislative framework that should be accepted. [News analysis, Page A12.]\nIn her remarks, Mrs. Pelosi delivered the obligatory promise of partnership with Republicans. But she immediately added a blunt warning to Mr. Bush on the war in Iraq.\n''The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end,'' she said, bringing Democrats to their feet.\nShe signaled to Mr. Bush that any plan to increase the American military presence in Iraq would meet stiff opposition in the new Congress.\n''It is the responsibility of the president to articulate a new plan for Iraq that makes it clear to the Iraqis that they must defend their own streets and their own security,'' she said, ''a plan that promotes stability in the region and a plan that allows us to responsibly redeploy our troops.''\nMrs. Pelosi's triumphal 20-minute remarks were frequently interrupted by applause, much like a presidential State of the Union address, which is delivered annually from the same rostrum in the House chamber. Cheering her on from the gallery were members of her family, dozens of California supporters and celebrities including Tony Bennett, Carole King and Richard Gere.\nMr. Boehner sat glum and unmoving in his seat for much of the hour it took to record the vote that put Mrs. Pelosi in the speaker's chair. The former speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, now just a Republican member of Congress from Illinois, stood hunched and hulking by the back rail of the chamber.\nMrs. Pelosi sat on the House floor with several of her grandchildren as her Democratic colleagues rose to record their votes, many adding footnotes. Representative Loretta Sanchez, Democrat of California, said she voted ''for the empowerment of all women in the world.'' Seventy-one women will be in the House, a record.\nThe jubilant Democratic takeover of the House was an echo of the Republican ''revolution'' of 1994 in which Republicans took control of the House after 40 uninterrupted years of Democratic dominance.\nIn the Senate, Vice President Dick Cheney, in his constitutional role as president of the chamber, swore in the members, including 10 new senators, only one a Republican, Bob Corker of Tennessee. A beaming Bill Clinton, accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, and his mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham, looked from the gallery as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York took the oath at the outset of her second term, perhaps dreaming of another oath-taking that might be two years hence.\nThe first order of business for the new Democratic-led House was passage of a measure to limit gifts to lawmakers from lobbyists and to restrict subsidized flights on private aircraft. The bill is part of a larger package of ethics changes that Democrats are pushing as part of a promise to voters to end what they called a ''culture of corruption'' in Congress that led to several indictments and resignations of members last year.\nNext week, the Democrats plan a 100-hour blitz to raise the minimum wage, lift restrictions on federal financing of embryonic stem cell research and allow the government to negotiate price cuts with pharmaceutical companies for the Medicare prescription drug program, among other matters. By the time they have clocked the 100 hours of legislative debate, House Democrats also plan to have passed bills to cut interest rates on student loans and roll back subsidies for oil and gas producers, seeking to make a statement of priorities, pressure the Senate to act and put an active agenda before the country before Mr. Bush's State of the Union address on Jan. 23.\nIn an early sign of bipartisanship, Senators Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, introduced a bill to repeal the individual alternative minimum tax, which is imposing an increasingly heavy burden on middle-income taxpayers.\nBut before much real business was conducted, Democratic lawmakers adjourned for a round of festivities to celebrate their victories and to lubricate their donors in what resembled nothing so much as a scaled-down presidential inaugural.\nRepresentative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, who engineered the election of 42 new Democrats to the House as leader of the party's Congressional campaign committee, threw a huge reception at Johnny's Half Shell across the street from the Capitol. Mrs. Pelosi was the host of a gala at the National Building Museum at which Mr. Bennett and Ms. King were scheduled to perform.\nSenator Claire McCaskill, the newly elected Democrat from Missouri and one of 16 women in the Senate, seemed a bit in awe after taking the oath of office on Thursday afternoon.\n''Anybody who would go through that and not feel overwhelmed with the enormity of the institution and the men and women who have served there would have to be in a coma,'' Ms. McCaskill said in the lobby outside the Senate chamber. ''I'm sure there will be tough times ahead, but it's thrilling to be part of one of this country's enduring institutions.''\nTHE 110TH CONGRESS
1816584	Speculation Surrounds Choice By Spy Chief to Take Step Back	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501EFDB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	From the start, John D. Negroponte felt miscast as the nation's first director of national intelligence, a diplomat who never seemed comfortable in spook's clothing, colleagues and friends of his said.\nEven at age 67, Mr. Negroponte longed to be back in the thick of policymaking, they said. But he knew it was the one role he was barred from playing as long as he remained the nation's top intelligence chief, whose role is to step into the Oval Office each morning as a neutral, impartial adviser on the threats lurking around the globe.\nIt was because of this, officials said, that he agreed to do something generally unheard of in a city obsessed with the bureaucratic totem pole: trade a cabinet-level job for a subcabinet post as deputy secretary of state, a job that essentially requires him to handle tasks that Condoleezza Rice would rather not deal with.\nMr. Negroponte leaves his office at Bolling Air Force Base after only 19 months and with mixed reviews. The base is the home of a new intelligence bureaucracy created to solve the problems laid bare after the Sept. 11 attacks, but Mr. Negroponte barely had time to get it running. All over Washington on Thursday, there were questions about whether Mr. Negroponte was there long enough to lay the foundations of real change and whether his transfer suggested that the Bush administration was less committed than it claimed to be to an intelligence overhaul that President Bush had billed as the most significant restructuring of American spy agencies in half a century.\nSenior administration officials said it was Mr. Bush who personally asked Mr. Negroponte to take on the diplomatic post sometime last month. It was the second time in two years that Mr. Bush had turned to Mr. Negroponte to fill a critical job: Mr. Negroponte became the director of national intelligence only after several other candidates had turned down the job. This time around, Ms. Rice had requested over the summer that Mr. Negroponte become her deputy. But the decision languished for months as the White House sought an adequate replacement for the spy chief, and as Mr. Negroponte vacillated between remaining at the helm of an intelligence community that numbered roughly 100,000 people and a return to the State Department, in the shadow of the administration's most visible international figure.\nSenior administration officials said that Ms. Rice wanted Mr. Negroponte to focus on China and North Korea, which have been among his focuses in the intelligence post, and on Iraq, a country he knows particularly well.\nMr. Negroponte has also served as ambassador to the United Nations, Mexico, the Philippines and Honduras, in a Foreign Service career that spanned more than three decades. A senior administration official who was involved in discussions about his nomination said that Ms. Rice regarded him as a foreign policy moderate who could help fill the big voids left by the departure of Robert B. Zoellick, who stepped down as deputy secretary last summer, and Philip D. Zelikow, who left the job of State Department counselor last month.\nMs. Rice would continue to play a central role in Iraq policy, the official said, but she has also made it clear that she wants to devote more time to a broader diplomatic initiative aimed at Middle East peace.\nMr. Bush is expected to nominate Mike McConnell, a retired vice admiral and former chief of the National Security Agency, to be Mr. Negroponte's successor.\nJohn E. McLaughlin, a former director of central intelligence who is a friend of Mr. Negroponte, said that he managed to make the transition from career Foreign Service officer to the intelligence arena with little difficulty, but that Mr. Negroponte was now returning to the world where he felt most at ease.\nMr. McLaughlin said he believed that Mr. Negroponte's familiarity with the latest intelligence from Iraq would help to bring a ''realistic'' view of the situation there as the administration works to develop a new strategy.\nBut other intelligence experts expressed concern about what Mr. Negroponte's departure might mean to the office he helped to establish. ''My major concern about this appointment is not about the State Department, but what happens at the D.N.I. office,'' said Lee H. Hamilton, who served as co-chairman of both the 9/11 commission and the Iraq Study Group. ''The future of that office and the concept of intelligence-sharing is on the line.''\nTop Congressional officials responded angrily to the news of Mr. Negroponte's departure.\n''I think he walked off the job, and I don't like it,'' said Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, the new chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nJust as Mr. Negroponte is leaving his post, his office is finishing a major National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's chances of surviving as a unified, independent country -- a review that was commissioned only after a Congressional request over the summer, on a problem that Mr. Negroponte will have to help manage in his new post.\n''He came into it after just a year in Iraq, and someone without a strong background in intelligence, and I think he is leaving awfully early, given the importance of getting this right,'' said Robert Hutchings, the senior diplomat in residence at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, who once headed the National Intelligence Council.\n''I think it is quite irresponsible,'' he said.\nMr. Hutchings said the departure would compound ''three or four years of nonstop turmoil'' within American intelligence agencies.\nBush administration officials noted several successes during Mr. Negroponte's tenure, most significant the creation and progress of the National Counterterrorism Center. Terrorism experts have credited the center with fusing information from across the intelligence community to understand better the global terrorism threat.\nBut as he assembled a staff of more than 1,500 people, he was criticized for simply adding another layer to a bureaucracy he was assigned to streamline. But some intelligence experts said that the criticism was unfair, and that the real blame rested with Congress for passing convoluted legislation that made bureaucratic bloat at the director of national intelligence office inevitable. Some critics say that the job of spy czar was never necessary to begin with. Some of those whom the White House first approached to take the job nearly two years ago -- including Robert M. Gates, the newly installed secretary of defense -- were deeply skeptical about whether that structure would work.\nThe White House spokesman, Tony Snow, said that President Bush was ''very impressed'' with the job Mr. Negroponte had done.\nOne of the greatest difficulties of Mr. Negroponte's position has been trying to wrest control over multibillion dollar spy satellites and other gadgetry from the Pentagon, which historically had been in charge of 80 percent of the nation's intelligence budget.\nOne of the top priorities of the former defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, was to expand the Pentagon's role in intelligence gathering, and some members of Congress say that Mr. Negroponte was not aggressive enough in bringing the Pentagon's intelligence budget more under his control.\nSome intelligence experts believe that Mr. Gates is likely to be less territorial than Mr. Rumsfeld was about the Pentagon's intelligence functions, and may even be eager to cede some of the Pentagon's authority to the new intelligence chief. Others said that the job of corralling 16 sometimes dysfunctional intelligence agencies is an often thankless task, and one where it is difficult to have a noticeable impact. Mr. Negroponte is said by associates to have grown particularly weary of clashes with members of Congress.\n''I think it's pretty telling that both Bob Gates and John Negroponte prefer jobs trying to bail us out of Iraq to the job of trying to fix U.S. intelligence,'' said Amy Zegart, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles and an expert in intelligence overhaul.
1816585	In a War With Vague Boundaries, A Terror Detainee Longs for Court	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903EFDB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Ali al-Marri, whom the government calls a sleeper agent for Al Qaeda and who is the only person on the American mainland still held as an enemy combatant, spends his days in a small cell in solitary confinement at the Navy brig in Charleston, S.C. When he is in an ironic mood, his lawyers say, he calls the cell his villa.\nMr. Marri waits there for word from his wife, two sons and three daughters, whom he last saw in 2001, just before his arrest in Peoria, Ill., where he was studying computer science at Bradley University.\nLetters arrive, but they are late and have words and sentences blacked out. A note his wife sent to him 10 months ago landed recently. It began with a standard Muslim invocation, but a word was missing. Mr. Marri is pretty sure it was ''Allah.''\nBut mostly Mr. Marri waits for word from a federal appeals court, which will soon rule on one of the most urgent questions in American law, one his case presents in stark form: May the government indefinitely detain a foreigner living legally in the United States, without charges and without access to the courts?\nMr. Marri, who is 41 and a citizen of Qatar, wants the right to challenge President Bush's assertion that he is a terrorist and ''a grave danger to the national security of the United States.''\nThe Bush administration says the courts cannot second-guess the president when he decides that someone is an enemy combatant, at least when noncitizens are involved. Detaining combatants is a military rather than a criminal matter, the administration says, adding that its purpose is not to punish the prisoner but to stop him from returning to the battlefield.\nThe implications of that position are startling, according to a brief filed last month in Mr. Marri's case by some 30 constitutional scholars. ''The government's interpretation would be vastly threatening to the liberty of more than 20 million noncitizens residing in the United States,'' the brief said, ''exposing them to the risk of irremediable indefinite detention on the basis of unfounded rumors, mistaken identity, the desperation of other detainees subject to coercive interrogation, and the deliberate lies of actual terrorists.''\nKathleen M. Blomquist, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, disputed that contention.\n''Of all the terrorists currently in the custody of the United States military, al-Marri is the only one who was captured in the United States,'' Ms. Blomquist said, adding that the notion that millions of people are at risk is ''unfounded and absurd.''\nMr. Bush's determination that Mr. Marri is an enemy combatant, she said, was based on substantial evidence, including ''his association with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and files found on his computer concerning chemical weapons of mass destruction.''\nMr. Marri maintains his innocence, his lawyers say. But they have refused to offer point-by-point rebuttals of the government's detailed assertions, calling instead for prosecutors to offer evidence to back them up in court.\n''In a civilized society and under American law and tradition,'' said Jonathan Hafetz, a lawyer for Mr. Marri with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, ''the government has the obligation to prove its case.''\nOne of Mr. Marri's brothers, Mohammed Marri, in a telephone interview from Qatar, rejected the charge that Mr. Marri is a terrorist. ''For sure it's not true,'' he said.\nA third brother, Jarallah, is at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, held as an enemy combatant based on accusations that he had visited a Qaeda camp. ''This is not a proper way to treat other people from other countries,'' Mohammed Marri said of his brothers and other detainees. ''If they are guilty, let them prove it in court.''\nAn Exclusive Club\nThe Charleston brig can hold 288 military prisoners and 6 enemy combatants, but there have never been more than 3 in the exclusive enemy combatant club. Two of them are now gone.\nOne of them, Yaser Hamdi, was freed and sent to Saudi Arabia after the United States Supreme Court allowed him to challenge his detention in 2004. Jose Padilla was transferred to the criminal justice system last year just as the Supreme Court was considering whether to review his case. That leaves only Mr. Marri.\nMr. Hamdi and Mr. Padilla are American citizens, but Mr. Marri is not. They were seized abroad or on their way back to the United States, while Mr. Marri was living what seemed to be an ordinary life, in Peoria, a city often caricatured as the nation's most ordinary, with a family and a minivan.\nThe government contends in a partly declassified declaration from a senior defense intelligence official, Jeffrey N. Rapp, and in a recent book by former Attorney General John Ashcroft, that Mr. Marri was a Qaeda sleeper agent sent to the United States to commit mass murder and disrupt the banking system.\nThe assertions have not been tested in court, and human rights groups say they are based on unreliable evidence ''There is substantial reason to believe,'' lawyers for two of the groups wrote in a brief in November, ''that the allegations of the Rapp declaration are derived from the torture of two men interrogated at Guantánamo Bay and other detention sites: Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi.''\nThe government says that Mr. Hawsawi was one of the financiers of the Sept. 11 attacks.\nMr. Rapp's declaration cites the personal views of Mr. Mohammed, who is often referred to as K.S.M. ''K.S.M. considered al-Marri an ideal sleeper agent,'' Mr. Rapp wrote.\nKept in Isolation\nMr. Marri was kept in isolation at the brig and, according to his court filings, subjected to tough interrogation. Interrogators threatened to send him to Egypt or Saudi Arabia, according to a lawsuit filed on his behalf in 2005, ''where, they told him, he would be tortured and sodomized and where his wife would be raped in front on him.''\n''By winter '05,'' Andrew J. Savage, who also represents Mr. Marri, said in a recent interview, ''I genuinely thought he was losing his mind. He told me in this sort of indirect way that he might not be able to hold on, that his mind was playing tricks on him.''\nMr. Padilla's lawyers have said that their client's time in the brig was so grueling that he is not fit to stand trial. But while Mr. Padilla was passive, Mr. Marri pushed back. He put wet toilet paper on the video camera, for instance. The brig responded by taking away his mattress, Koran and hygienic products, including his toilet paper.\n''There is almost nothing to distract him from his torment,'' his lawyers wrote in the lawsuit, ''and he therefore becomes preoccupied with his pain and the degradation he suffers.''\nPerhaps as a consequence of the lawsuit, conditions have improved.\nWhen Mr. Marri's lawyers were first allowed to see him in October 2004, after the decision in Mr. Hamdi's case, Mr. Marri was behind a transparent barrier and bound in leg-irons and handcuffs that were linked to a belly-chain and fastened to the floor. Officials from the Defense Intelligence Agency and the brig were present, and the conversation was videotaped.\nOn a recent visit, Mr. Savage said, he met his client in a visiting lounge. Mr. Marri, who was not restrained, was wearing stylish bifocals rather than institutional prison glasses. He was also wearing a watch, which makes it easier for him to know when to pray.\nMr. Savage brought hummus and pita bread. ''We sat down, we broke bread, and we had a three-and-a-half hour conversation, unmonitored,'' Mr. Savage said.\nMr. Marri is now allowed to watch television in the evening, but not the news. He reads newspapers and magazines, but they are edited. ''Brig staff remove all materials associated with the war on terror from them,'' Cmdr. Stephanie L. Wright, the brig's commanding officer, said in court filing in July.\nSometimes that makes for a thin newspaper. ''All I get is sports and obits,'' Mr. Marri has complained, Mr. Savage said. He is critical of the former, saying there is not enough soccer coverage.\nThe Defense Department has allowed journalists and others to tour the Guantánamo facility, where Mr. Marri's brother Jarallah and 400 other men are being held. All of the Guantánamo prisoners are foreigners who were seized abroad. The government has not asserted that the brothers were working together.\nThe Defense Department refused a recent request to inspect the Charleston brig. A spokesman, Cmdr. J. D. Gordon, cited ''operational security concerns surrounding the detention of an alleged al Qaeda-linked operative in the U.S. mainland,'' a reference to Mr. Marri. Commander Gordon added that ''it has always been our policy to treat all detainees humanely.''\nReturn to the United States\nMr. Marri spent eight years in the United States as a young man, graduating from Bradley with an undergraduate degree in business administration in 1991. When he returned to the United States 10 years later, he brought his family.\nIn his declaration, Mr. Rapp noted that Mr. Marri's profile ''differed significantly from that of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers.'' Those differences, Mr. Rapp said, made Mr. Marri all the more attractive to Al Qaeda.\nThe years between Mr. Marri's two stints at Bradley are a mystery. The government says he trained at a Qaeda camp in Afghanistan for about a year and a half between 1996 and 1998, specializing in poisons. The government also says that Mr. Marri visited the United States briefly in 2000, which Mr. Marri has denied.\nIn the summer of 2001, Mr. Rapp wrote, Mr. Mohammed introduced Mr. Marri to Osama bin Laden. Mr. Marri ''offered to be an Al Qaeda martyr,'' Mr. Rapp wrote.\n''Al Qaeda instructed al-Marri that it was imperative that he arrive in the United States prior to Sept. 11, 2001, and that if al-Marri could not do so, that he should cancel all his plans and go to Pakistan,'' Mr. Rapp wrote.\nThe Marris arrived in Peoria on Sept. 10, 2001.\nMr. Marri soon came to the attention of the F.B.I., which first interviewed him less than a month later. In December, agents searched his laptop, finding ''research consistent with the tradecraft and teachings associated with Al Qaeda,'' Mr. Rapp wrote. Mr. Marri was arrested on Dec. 12, 2001, and held as a material witness at the request of prosecutors in New York. He was indicted two months later on charges of credit card fraud. In January 2003, the government added charges of lying to federal agents and financial institutions, and identity theft. Mr. Marri pleaded not guilty. His family has since returned to the Middle East.\nFor a year and a half, the government pursued a conventional criminal case. Mr. Ashcroft, in his book ''Never Again,'' which was published in October, wrote that Mr. Marri ''rejected numerous offers to improve his lot'' by cooperating with investigators. ''He insisted,'' Mr. Ashcroft wrote, ''on becoming a 'hard case.' ''\nIn June 2003, as the case was nearing trial, the government abruptly changed course, taking Mr. Marri out of the criminal system and moving him into indefinite military detention. That means, Mr. Ashcroft later wrote, that Mr. Marri can be held ''at least until the war against Al Qaeda was over.''\nIn its rush to move Mr. Marri, the government short-circuited its criminal case. On hearing that a federal judge in Peoria would allow Mr. Marri's lawyers to file papers opposing the transfer as long as the criminal case was alive, the government agreed to dismiss the criminal charges with prejudice, meaning they cannot be refiled.\nThe decision, however, would not prevent the government from charging Mr. Marri with other crimes outlined in Mr. Rapp's declaration.\nThe declaration has served the purpose for which it was designed. In August, it persuaded Henry F. Floyd, a federal judge in Spartanburg, S.C., to deny a habeas corpus petition challenging Mr. Marri's detention. Saying that Mr. Marri had ''offered nothing more than a general denial'' of the assertions in the declaration, Judge Floyd dismissed the petition.\nNeither side was happy with the ruling. Mr. Marri has appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, saying that the president does not have the power to detain him as an enemy combatant.\nA foreigner living legally in the United States, his lawyers say, is not the same as a soldier captured on a battlefield. Even if the president does have the power, they say, he should be required to support his assertions with evidence.\nThe government argues that Judge Floyd gave Mr. Marri too full a hearing. It cited the recent Military Commissions Act, which says that the courts have no jurisdiction to hear challenges from any alien ''who has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant.''\nThe case will be heard Feb. 1\nThe government offered Mr. Marri a sort of consolation prize should the appeals court dismiss his case. It said he could try to persuade a combatant status review tribunal, convened by the Defense Department, that he was not an enemy combatant. That would apparently be the first such proceeding on the mainland; all of the others known to have been conducted were at Guantánamo Bay.\nA Different View\nIn a brief filed in November, eight former Justice Department officials, including Janet Reno, the attorney general in the Clinton administration, said that taking Mr. Marri out of the criminal system as his case approached trial ''has given to the appearance of manipulation of the judicial process.'' The brief listed several criminal statutes available to prosecute people accused of terrorism along with many successful prosecutions under them.\n''The criminal justice system has proven that it can make the cases,'' Ms. Reno said in an interview. ''For the president to be able to designate someone as an enemy combatant, without process and without regulation, just doesn't make any sense and isn't necessary.''\nMs. Blomquist, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said, ''While we respect the views of former law enforcement officials, the United States cannot afford to retreat to a pre-September 11 mind-set that treats terrorism solely as a domestic law enforcement problem.''\nMr. Marri shared a fantasy with one of his lawyers not long ago. ''I'd love to be taken back to Saudi Arabia and they would beat the'' -- here, he swore -- ''out of me for six months,'' Mr. Marri said, according to Mr. Savage. ''It would be brutal, but it would be finite.''

That could be the motto of the six artists (Diana Cooper, Tara Donovan, Charles Goldman, Jason Rogenes, Jane South and Phoebe Washburn) in this spirited, if uneven, show organized by Apsara DiQuinzio, a curatorial associate at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. All favor a time-intensive, process-oriented approach in 10 hybrid works -- 11, counting Mr. Goldman's MySpace page, cited on the checklist -- that traverse painting, drawing, sculpture and installation.\nThe unifying thread is a kind of magpie postminimalism, which invigorates familiar abstract strategies -- grids, serial repetition, reductive forms -- using materials scavenged from everyday life. A short list includes woodchips, oil drums, straight pins, electrical cords and live snails. The best works rely on recycled ingredients, Dumpster-diving their way to a sustainable art.\nThe Whitney's Altria branch, a modest gallery and a sprawling public atrium, is an architectural Jekyll and Hyde. The maniacal side wins out here in a pair of visionary large-scale installations by Mr. Rogenes and Ms. Washburn that bookend the sculpture court. (An underwhelming selection of bucket-based objects by Mr. Goldman is also displayed.)\nAn ingenious composite of Brancusi's ''Endless Column,'' Dan Flavin's fluorescence, and pyramid power, Mr. Rogenes's 40-foot-high construction pairs an illuminated totem pole of found polystyrene packaging with a cardboard construction that recalls the modular polygons of Buckminster Fuller. Ms. Washburn's ambitious structure, modestly titled ''A Minor In-House Brain Storm,'' is a winningly ramshackle, self-contained ecosystem, complete with aquatic plants (and the snails).\nBy contrast, the sparse trio of works inside the gallery looks staid. Ms. Donovan's shimmering cube of straight pins lacks menace, and Ms. South's verdigris-colored cut-and-folded paper relief appears diagrammatic. Only Ms. Cooper's wall-work -- a viral concoction of vinyl, paper, felt and ink -- surprises as it sprouts from itself around a column like a cartoon spore.\nANDREA K. SCOTT
1816587	Art in Review; Henry Darger	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEFDB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Vivian Girls Emerge Andrew Edlin 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea Through Jan. 13\nHenry Darger was a reclusive, visionary outsider genius whose work, discovered only after his death in 1973, descended on art-world consciousness in one enormous clump of mostly undated painting and writing. But that doesn't mean Darger didn't have a traceable development like supposed insider artists.\nThis riveting exhibition does some tracing. It mainly shows Darger, whose work centered on the travails of the fictional Vivian Girls, gathering images from printed sources and then experimenting with ways of using them. Its pièce de résistance is an enormous panoramic collage on cardboard, heavily varnished and nearly 10 feet across, known as ''The Battle of Calverhine.''\nThis work is a rarity for Darger because it can be dated: a newspaper from 1929 is varnished to its back. Dark and congested, it also doesn't quite look like Darger's work, thanks partly to the varnish, which he would dispense with later, just as he would replace cardboard with paper and evolve an elaborate process of copying and photographically enlarging images from coloring books. Two other large panoramas show him moving in this direction.\nIn ''The Battle of Calverhine,'' Darger simply knit hundreds of hand-cut magazine photographs and photogravures into an uninterrupted expanse of mayhem that he carefully hand-tinted in lurid colors. The battle is punctuated by explosions, dark clouds, fighting soldiers and distant regiments of marching soldiers that are mostly tinted magenta. The space of this horrific scene closes up and opens inward in disorienting waves. It is a staggering work, leathery and reliclike, with most of Pop Art embedded in its fragile surfaces. This is its first showing in the United States. Catch it while you can.\nROBERTA SMITH
1816588	Art in Review; Iván Navarro	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDB1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Concentration Camp Roebling Hall 606 West 26th Street, Chelsea Through Wednesday\nIván Navarro's black-light neon sculptures are on the gimmicky side; never mind their supposed concern with power and torture and, thus, the background of this Chilean-born, New York-based artist. In an uncomfortably dark gallery, this show includes actual-size outlines of Marcel Breuer's classic Wassily chair and Gerrit Rietveld's Z chair, as well as a basketball hoop. Mr. Navarro is also known for sculptures quoting well-known Modernist furniture, using fluorescent tubes. The fluorescent works are more engaging because the translation is more awkward, as suggested by a wheelbarrow made of purple-colored fluorescent tubes. But the real draw of this show is a melancholic music video that shows the wheelbarrow in action.\nIn this video, titled ''Flashlight: I Am Not From Here, I Am Not From There,'' Mr. Navarro's collaborator is Christian Torres-Roje, a member of the band Nutria, from Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Dressed as a down-and-out man, Mr. Torres-Roje pushes the wheelbarrow around the urban wilds, past crumbling warehouses and along train tracks. The tubes are lighted by power from a generator riding in the wheelbarrow; the generator runs on gasoline he siphoned from a car. Periodically he stops to change the color of the fluorescent tubes -- they are violet, then yellow, then white, then red -- like a methodical laborer going about his tasks.\nOn the soundtrack Mr. Torres-Roje sings in Spanish, with English subtitles, his cover of the Latin ballad ''No Soy de Aquí, Ni Soy de Allá'' (the video's subtitle, in Spanish), giving an almost exquisite poignancy to its lyrics, whose mixture of memory, regret and joy seems perfectly tailored to Mr. Torres-Roje's wanderings. Dusk settles, and the wheelbarrow, a rolling flashlight, seems to proceed under its own power. There is something ineffably sad in the combination of absurdity, injustice and beauty that these maneuvers convey.\nROBERTA SMITH

WHAT -- 4-bedroom house WHERE -- St. Petersburg, Fla.\nWhen I bought this house two years ago it was really a tear-down, but I decided instead to fix it up. In the process, I added a full wireless automation system to the house. I'm the director of corporate innovation for Intermatic, which makes, among other products, wireless lighting controls. There are a slew of products out there from different manufacturers including thermostats and security systems that have wireless capability and can be controlled remotely over the Internet.\nWhen my son comes down here and turns the thermostat down to 68 degrees, I can turn it back up from my home in Illinois. I can log on to a Web page from anywhere and control all the lights, the drapes, the outdoor lights, the garage door and even the temperature of the hot tub. One day, I logged on and saw that the hot tub was 103 degrees. My son had been using the house and forgot to turn it off. I don't ever rent out my house, but family members use it when I'm not there. They don't always remember to turn off the lights or adjust the thermostat when they leave. They don't get the electric bill.\nHard-wiring an existing house with these capabilities would be an electrician's dream. It would cost tens of thousands of dollars. But with these new wireless systems it ran about $4,000 to set up. But more importantly, it gives me peace of mind. The house still has old hurricane shutters that have to be put up the old-fashioned way, but early this year new models that attach to the house and can be operated over a computer should be out.\nAs told to Amy Gunderson\nInformation on properties was supplied by the listing companies.\nWHERE -- Coronado, Calif.

1816590	Remain Silent? Some in Custody Spell It All Out	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E7DA1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The ''Beast of Broadway,'' as the tabloids call him, a successful actor, has been accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. But his grade-school teacher would be proud of him in at least one respect: He is a good speller.\nThat much was clear in the two and-a-half page written statement he gave the police after he was arrested, a statement that recounted a behind-the-scenes theater tour for the girl. He wrote these words voluntarily despite a constitutional right to remain silent that is ingrained not only in criminal law, but also in popular culture. But he was hardly the only person arrested in New York in recent years who opened up once the cuffs went on.\nA former Women's Wear Daily writer, accused of disguising himself in a firefighter's costume and sexually assaulting a former colleague on Halloween, kept detectives spellbound with his disquisitions on Chinese menus and book rights.\nA homeless man accused of stabbing a tourist as he rode with his girlfriend on the subway found that words weren't enough. Asked to sign his confession, he instead sketched a cartoon version of his crime: a pair of lovers' faces -- one happy and one sad -- and a stormy black cloud floating over a subway train.\nSuch statements -- and occasional illustrations -- by defendants in New York City courts are one element of what prosecutors call the V.D.F., more formally known as the People's Voluntary Disclosure Form. To read them is to experience a kind of poetry of everyday criminal life in New York City.\nBy turns raw, ugly, poignant, defiant, rarely remorseful and almost always damaging, the statements are a window into the criminal process, part of the common language between detectives and suspects.\n''It's kind of like the literature of the criminal defendant,'' said Gerald L. Shargel, a criminal defense lawyer. ''The information contained on the V.D.F. is much more rich and colorful than anything the defense lawyer provides.''\nBecause they can be so revealing, the V.D.F.'s are a bane of defense lawyers' existence, and they often try to suppress them so they cannot be used in court.\nMore technically, the Voluntary Disclosure Form is a rough, preliminary summary of the evidence, which the prosecution is required to give to the defense. There is space for prosecutors to type out information like the date, place and time of the ''occurrence.''\nAnd there is space for detectives to provide statements made by defendants at the time of arrest, either as summarized by the police, or in the defendant's own writing.\nFor many people, the urge to explain, if not to confess, is as urgent as it was for Raskolnikov in ''Crime and Punishment.''\n''My name is Paul Cortez,'' is the Melvillian first sentence of the V.D.F. statement handwritten by Mr. Cortez, a yoga teacher who is awaiting trial as the suspect in the fatal stabbing of a dancer in her Upper East Side apartment.\nWhat follows is a three-page roller coaster ride of love, sex and betrayal, culminating in an alibi. On the day of the victim's death, Mr. Cortez wrote, ''I knew something was wrong, so I called back several times.'' When she didn't answer, he called clients, watched a football game with a friend, ''then read a little and went to bed. The next morning about 10:30 I found out from my mom Catherine was Dead.''\nThe last word, ''Dead,'' is capitalized for emphasis.\nProsecutors love to have defendants volunteer an alibi because it shows what they call ''consciousness of guilt.''\nStacey Richman, a criminal defense lawyer, summed up her advice to any accused who may feel the urge to chat: ''You have a right to remain silent. Exercise that right.''\nWhen Peter Braunstein, the former Women's Wear Daily writer, was arrested in Memphis in December 2005, he seemed, in one of many Hamlet-like moments, torn about talking. ''I really don't think I should talk to you,'' Mr. Braunstein began, according to his V.D.F. ''I think I should do the whole lawyer thing.''\nAnd then he kept talking.\n''Everybody talks,'' said Daniel J. Castleman, chief of investigations for the Manhattan district attorney. ''Almost nobody doesn't talk. And the reason for that is that people think they can either talk their way out of it or mitigate the crime. It's human nature.''\nMr. Braunstein, who is in a mental hospital awaiting trial on charges of kidnapping and sexual abuse, seemed to delight in his celebrity. ''Defendant referred to book and movie deals using the name of the complainant several times,'' the V.D.F. says.\nHe fantasized about ordering Chinese food. ''Defendant stated that after seeing news reports, if he went to a Chinese restaurant, he should order something other than beef with extra mustard because that is what the wanted poster says he orders, but if he did that, it would be too obvious, so he would order beef with extra mustard, but he had not eaten Chinese food for a while.''\nMr. Braunstein did not sign anything, unlike James Barbour, the actor called the ''Beast of Broadway,'' who once played the Beast in ''Beauty and the Beast.'' Mr. Barbour wrote his statement in block letters, correctly spelled, indented and punctuated it, and signed it with a flourish.\nAccused of having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl, he wrote, ''She told me that she was 16.''\nUnfortunately for Mr. Barbour, the age of consent in New York is 17.\n''That evening we went to a Broadway show, 'George Gershwin Alone,' '' wrote Mr. Barbour, who is free on $10,000 bail. ''I introduced her to the star of the show, gave her a backstage tour. The relationship stopped suddenly because I thought it was inappropriate and could get dangerous.''\nDefendants may try to talk their way out of a charge, but do they succeed?\n''Never,'' said Gerald B. Lefcourt, who has defended clients from the Black Panthers to Harry B. Helmsley. ''Which is why if it's up to me, every client I have should know they should never, ever, under any circumstances speak to law enforcement unless I'm there.''\nWhat Joseph Weir, accused of groping feet on the subway, lacked in spelling skills, he made up for with an almost Gallic appreciation for women. ''I complyment woman, I bow down to them, sometime I kiss there feet and grab legs.'' Mr. Weir, charged with sex abuse, coercion and other less than gallant acts, is due back in court on Jan. 19.\nAlexis Quinlin, a swindler posing as a French photographer, actually wrote his statement in French, perhaps casting doubt on those who would contend that the police put words in the mouths of criminals.\n''Je m'appelle Alexis Quinlin,'' wrote Mr. Quinlin, who was convicted of grand larceny and sentenced to up to seven and a half years in prison, but was not lying about being French. He described how he signed a contract under the assumed name of Jean Baptiste Mondino, which was, he admitted, ''une grave erreur.''\nRobert De Niro's housekeeper, Lucyna Turyk-Wawrynowicz, accused of stealing clothes and jewelry from her wealthy employers, made the mistake of giving the police shopping tips. ''Anybody can buy a jacket like this at Century 21,'' Ms. Turyk-Wawrynowicz said after she was taken into custody in June 2005, according to a transcript typed by the police.\nAn hour later, she was insulting Mr. De Niro's wife, Grace Hightower, saying, ''She is mean.''\nAfter about three hours, she announced, ''The diamonds are in the bathroom.''\nAfter requesting a Starbucks skim latte from the detectives questioning her, she threw in the towel.\n''I am evil and guilty, but my husband did nothing,'' she said. ''You can cut my hands and head off, but I can tell you he did nothing wrong.'' She pleaded guilty to grand larceny and last February was sentenced to up to three years in prison.\nOthers get right to the point.\n''I hate Sammy,'' Kristina Caban said of the man she was accused of branding with an ''R,'' as if he were a bull, according to the police transcript. ''He raped me two years ago.'' Ms. Caban, charged with assault with intent to disfigure permanently, is due back in court on Jan. 11.\nCivil libertarians have called for police interrogations to be videotaped. ''We've had reports from clients who say they wrote something, but the police officers were dictating it,'' said Seymour W. James Jr., the lawyer in charge of the criminal practice at the Legal Aid Society. ''They're intimidated by the police after hours of questioning.''\nSometimes, it takes very little prompting for a defendant to put her foot in her mouth. In her V.D.F., Andrea Schwartz, whom the tabloids have termed ''the Brazilian madam,'' is quoted telling the police as she was arrested: ''I'm not a prostitute. I just hook guys up with girls if they want them.''\nThat did not stop prosecutors from indicting her on prostitution charges last June. She is awaiting trial.\nEditors' Note: January 25, 2007, Thursday A front-page article on Jan. 5 about the tendency of criminal suspects in New York City to give revealing and usually damaging statements to the police, despite their right to remain silent, included excerpts from the statement of James Barbour, a Broadway actor accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. According to his statement, Mr. Barbour told the police that he had lain on a bed with the girl and that they had kissed.\nBut the article should have made it clear that in the statement, Mr. Barbour does not admit or confess to having sexually assaulted the girl, and that he has pleaded not guilty.
1816591	Miers Steps Down as White House Counsel	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E7DA1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Harriet E. Miers, President Bush's longtime confidante and onetime Supreme Court nominee, has resigned as White House counsel, officials said Thursday.\nTony Snow, the White House spokesman, said that Mr. Bush had accepted Ms. Miers's resignation ''reluctantly'' and that she had tendered it after deciding she was ready for a change after six years in the job. The White House said that a search for a successor was under way and that Ms. Miers would remain at her post through this month.\nMs. Miers's departure comes as the White House girds for possible confrontations with Congressional Democrats, who have promised oversight investigations into White House policies, including energy, the war in Iraq and national security.\nThe White House counsel's office would be central in attempts to stave off subpoenas and requests for sensitive information.\nEven before the Democratic victories in November, Republicans close to the White House speculated that it would seek to beef up the counsel's office.\nMr. Snow said Ms. Miers's departure was not the beginning of another round of changes in the West Wing.\n''For those who are speculating about any others within the White House proper, I am aware of none and expect none,'' Mr. Snow said.\nStill, her announced resignation came with Mr. Bush poised to name a new director of national intelligence, J. Michael McConnell, a retired Navy vice admiral and director of the National Security Agency from 1992 to 1996, and move his current director, John D. Negroponte, to the State Department as its second in command.\nRumors of Ms. Miers's departure date back to the White House shake-up last spring, when Joshua B. Bolten became Mr. Bush's chief of staff and undertook a review of all personnel. Mr. Bolten was said at the time to have raised the possibility of moving Ms. Miers out of the counsel's office, though White House officials denied it.\nMr. Snow said her decision to resign did come after a series of meetings with Mr. Bolten.\n''She's been here for six years,'' Mr. Snow said. ''It's hard duty.''\nMs. Miers has worked with Mr. Bush since his days as Texas governor and has grown close to him and the first lady, Laura Bush.\nMs. Miers started at the White House as staff secretary after the 2000 campaign and became a deputy chief of staff before moving to the White House counsel's office.\nMr. Bush's decision to nominate her to the Supreme Court in 2005 provoked the ire of liberals and conservatives, who criticized her as a Bush crony who did not have the legal intellectual credentials or résumé the job required. She withdrew her name from consideration but returned to Mr. Bush's inner circle and remained one of his closest advisers.\nIn her resignation letter, Ms. Miers said her own role in helping Mr. Bush choose nominees for the federal bench was ''among the most rewarding of my experiences.''

1816605	Handshakes, Hoodies And Hostility	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E6DA1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	The H.C. of the N.Y.J. introduced a novel approach yesterday to the bittersweet but largely bland business of competing against the familiar headmaster in the hoodie on the New England side of the field.\n''I thought my handshake was strong, firm,'' Eric Mangini said, breaking down his postgame salutations of earlier this season with his mentor betrayed, the Patriots' Bill Belichick. ''My dad always told me it was important to have a good handshake. I try to be consistent with that. I've experimented with a couple of different handshakes that haven't worked for me. So I feel good about what I brought in.''\nWhat Mangini delivered yesterday, with Armageddon a mere 72 hours away, was what is known outside the fraternity of fatally serious professional football coaches as a wry sense of humor. Give credit where it's due. Belichick, for his part, was probably off perfecting his look-away shake, or a halfhearted wave from the hole he will want to fall into should his Patriots go down and out Sunday to Mangini and the Jets.\nNot yet 36, riding a rookie coach wave of good cheer into his postseason debut, maybe Mangini understands he will be playing with house money at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., now that his 10-6 team has defied the experts, now that the genius we call Belichick has acknowledged him by name, been made to cry ''Eric.''\nAs it took four months and two regular-season snubs, it's difficult to not think there is some poetic justice in Belichick having to deal -- sooner than he ever imagined -- with Mangini in a postseason setting. This can't be fun for Belichick, sweating out the specter of being upstaged at home by Mangini, who as a wide-eyed twentysomething spliced film for him in Cleveland and rose all the way to defensive coordinator last season in New England before landing his head-coaching gig.\nNo one, least of all Mangini, expected Belichick to stay in close touch, telephone his encouragement, as have members of the old gang he mentioned yesterday -- Charlie Weis at Notre Dame, Romeo Crennel in Cleveland, even the patriarch of this successful but sometimes dysfunctional coaching family, old papa Parcells down in Dallas.\n''It's harder to call people in the same division,'' Mangini said, insisting as he has all season there is no Belichick feud, at least not from his end. ''The way I feel about Bill is the way I've felt about Bill since I first got to know him. My feelings have not changed one iota.''\nNor have Belichick's, apparently. Even when he admitted Wednesday, ''Eric and his staff have done a great job,'' it came with an addendum: Mangini inherited a team that two years ago was within a kick of the A.F.C. championship game.\nTrue that may be, it was another strange and petty slap upside the headset. Whatever Mangini's perceived offense -- he tampered with the former Patriots receiver Deion Branch or tried to recruit from Belichick's staff or refused Belichick's suggestion that he spurn an organization Belichick has come to despise -- Belichick's own separation from Bill Parcells made Mangini's from him look like a tearful embrace at the Foxborough bus station.\nAt least Mangini made a conventional departure, as opposed to Belichick's scribbling of his January 2000 resignation in shorthand -- the infamous disclaimer that he did not want to be the H.C. of the N.Y.J. -- on his way to the Patriots from the Jets.\nMuch as Belichick's decision to escape Parcells's shadow turned out to be the stroke of his career, it was a truly bizarre divorce, Little Bill from Big Bill, who himself has never quite perfected the art of the graceful exit. Is Parcells's clumsiness some kind of ancestral defect?\nWitness how the former Belichick assistant in Cleveland, Nick ''I'm not going to be the Alabama coach'' Saban, played his former employer in Miami against his new one in Tuscaloosa. After he was reminded again by Louisiana State on Wednesday night of how Notre Dame lacks the overall athleticism to compete on the January bowl stage, will Weis soon recant his contention of no interest in the Giants should a defeat Sunday in Philadelphia result in the dismissal of Tom Coughlin?\nConsider the gothic symmetry of Coughlin, another product of the Parcells School of Inner Conflict, replaced by Charlie the second-generation Tuna, while Parcells himself bows out (again) after a Cowboys defeat tomorrow in Seattle.\nInstead of firing up the Jets with old fight films, Mangini could consider showing them the Parcells extended coaching family archives. Then again, as Bert Randolph Sugar, boxing's cigar-chomping author and raconteur, reminded me the other day, there is a rather historic encounter that Mangini might recognize as fitting: Larry Holmes was a beloved sparring partner of Muhammad Ali's before soundly beating his mentor in a 1980 championship bout.\nWould Mangini be that self-serving? Is he breaking the mold, taking the career high road, or is he Eddie Haskell playing nice for the Cleavers of the news media?\n''He strikes me as a guy who has thought this was what he was going to do 15 to 20 years ago,'' said Pete Kendall, the Jets' candid guard. ''I don't think I can recall a moment where I looked over at him and thought, 'Uh, I bet he wishes he had a do-over there.' ''\nAs long as he doesn't get too sappy this weekend, roll out ''Rocky.''\n''I'm hoping he doesn't feel like he has to resort to fiction at this point,'' Kendall said.\nWhy would he? This long-running Jets-Patriots rivalry is as real as Belichick's resentment, as firm as the Mangini handshake will be Sunday, when he has so much to win and so little, really, to lose.\nSPORTS OF THE TIMES E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com
1816606	With a 3-Goal Barrage, Straka Humbles the Flyers	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DA1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	When his turn came to absorb the cheers after he was named the game's first star last night, Rangers forward Martin Straka skated a small circle on the Madison Square Garden ice. He raised his stick, lowered his eyes and disappeared into the tunnel as quickly as he could.\nStraka retreated from his moment in the sun, which came courtesy of a hat trick in the Rangers' 3-2 victory over Philadelphia. Like usual, Straka was content to let his game do most of his talking and all of his boasting.\n''I have said many times, sometimes you play the same way the whole year and the puck goes in and sometimes it doesn't,'' Straka said. ''When you have the confidence, maybe you have a little more luck.''\nOf all of the Rangers' big scorers, Straka is by far the most unassuming. He regularly draws praise from Coach Tom Renney for his diligent work habits and unflappable demeanor. It is impossible to tell after a game if Straka has scored three goals or none. He plays on a line next to the dynamic and charismatic Jaromir Jagr and Michael Nylander, a gourmet menu on which Straka's personality makes him the peanut butter sandwich.\n''He is a genuine, sincere guy, a soft-spoken, humble man who comes to work,'' Renney said. ''He works awfully hard.''\nThat hard work has produced 21 goals, the latest three fashioning his sixth career hat trick. Only Brendan Shanahan (23) has more goals for the Rangers this season.\nMost of Straka's success has come when Renney stops tinkering with his usual line combinations. For much of the Rangers' recent seven-game losing streak, Straka had been playing with Shanahan on the second line, an attempt to spread the scoring around.\nBut late in a 2-0 loss to the Islanders last week, Renney reached back for the chemistry of the Straka-Jagr-Nylander line and is now reaping the benefits. The Rangers (21-17-4) are on a three-game winning streak, firmly lodged in second place in the Atlantic Division and giving teams like Philadelphia nightmares about trying to stop their big three.\n''They're a first line that is as formidable as there is in the league,'' Shanahan said. ''I think the big thing they have is puck control. That's their best form of defense is having the puck on their stick.''\nStraka opened the Rangers' scoring early in the first, slipping free in front of the goal to fire a pass from Nylander past Flyers goalie Robert Esche. Straka scored again with 14 minutes 31 seconds left in the second, this time when a shot by Michal Rozsival deflected off Flyers defenseman Joni Pitkanen and bounced right to him.\nThe Flyers scored on a power play early in the third and came tantalizingly close to scoring again when a shot by Dimitry Afanasenkov bounced from one post to the other behind Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist. An instant later, Straka intercepted a Flyers pass, tipped it to himself and skated off for a breakaway. He faked Esche and slid a backhand inside the right post with 13:06 left.\nThe game got interesting late thanks to a stomach-dropping move by Lundqvist, who corralled the puck and spotted the Flyers' empty net with 21 seconds left. Lundqvist wound up to shoot, but instead hit Flyers forward Mike York in the chest. York quickly fired the puck past Lundqvist to make it a one-goal game.\nOn the bench, Renney looked stricken. ''Yeah, where's the air-travel bag,'' he said.\nLundqvist did not feel much better. ''It was a bad decision,'' he said. ''I definitely wouldn't have done that if it was a one-goal game.''\nFortunately for Lundqvist, Straka had already become the story. Not that Straka wanted it that way. He quickly credited his success to the outsized attention opponents pay to Jagr, who routinely gets double-teamed.\nAsked if that might change if he keeps scoring, Straka let out a big laugh.\n''Oh no,'' he said. ''Believe me it won't.''\nSLAP SHOTS\nDefenseman Marek Malik returned to the Rangers' lineup after missing seven games with a groin injury. Philadelphia center Peter Forsberg missed the game with a groin injury, the latest in a series of woes that has limited Forsberg to 27 games.\nHOCKEY
1816607	2 Miles in Newark That Run From Long Decline to Rebirth	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E5DA1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	Carolyn Whigham stood on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and took in the landscape of tattered brownstones, trash-strewn lots and skinny addicts by the front door of the funeral home that has been in her family for three generations. Then she closed her eyes and a vision of the street in the 1950s took hold, a reverie of mansions, graceful oak trees and the reassuring roar of a bustling industrial city.\n''I can see Lawyer Tate, Dr. Shelton, Old Lady Ruffin and all the beautiful buildings,'' Mrs. Whigham said, ticking off the people who once filled the granite-and-marble Victorians. ''It was a gem. For a black family, it was a dream to be living here.''\nIn the summer of 1967, the Whighams huddled on their rooftop as rioters burned neighboring buildings; then the Whighams helped bury a dozen victims of the violence. In the decades since, they have witnessed the flight of the professional class and the onslaught of drugs and despair, planning countless funerals for teenagers killed by gunfire and young mothers felled by AIDS.\n''To see all that happening to my street, to my city, has been very traumatic,'' Mrs. Whigham, 57, said.\nBut now, across the street from where she grew up, workers are laying sod in front of 100 crisp Georgian-style town houses that replaced a forbidding housing project. A few blocks north, a new dormitory for 800 students is to be finished by fall. To the east, the steel bones of a hockey arena are filling the horizon. Throughout Newark, even on the most ragged blocks, new three-family homes are selling for $400,000.\n''This city is coming back,'' Mrs. Whigham said. ''It's finally happening, and I believe it's going to happen in my lifetime.''\nAfter 30 years of decline and a decade of sporadic renewal efforts, the two-mile boulevard through Newark's Central Ward -- known as High Street until 1983 -- is showing signs of progress. So is the entire city.\nMore than 2,500 private homes are being built, Barnes & Noble is looking downtown, and hundreds of suburbanites and New Yorkers are moving into the city's first luxury high-rise in a generation.\nThough these projects began under his predecessor, Sharpe James, Cory A. Booker, Newark's ambitious young mayor, has revved up the momentum since he took office in July. He has made lofty promises to recast his struggling city as a national model for urban revitalization, and dismantled bureaucratic impediments to development. His administration plans to lift the more stringent zoning rules to encourage downtown residential construction, create building trade apprenticeships for jobless young people and develop a municipal loan pool for minority business owners.\n''It feels like all the pieces are finally coming together,'' said Dennis M. Bone, president of Verizon New Jersey, one of the few corporations to keep its headquarters here as Newark lost many of its blue-chip employers and almost half its population.\nYet Newark faces steep obstacles to prosperity. Real estate taxes are onerous, the public school system is in shambles and any new businesses Mr. Booker may bring in will find a largely unskilled work force: of those 25 and older, 58 percent lack a high school diploma and 9 percent have a bachelor's degree, according to the 2000 census.\nAs it stands, more than three-quarters of the city's 150,000 jobs are held by out-of-towners. For Mr. Booker, already tarnished in the eyes of some as an outsider for his suburban upbringing and criticized for hiring too many aides from New York, the true challenge will be to spread change beyond a few shiny spots in the business district downtown into the struggling neighborhoods.\n''All my life, the politicians have been calling this place the Renaissance City,'' complained Latonya Edwards, 28, a part-time security guard who is raising three children in a decrepit apartment building on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. ''I think the renaissance is for suburban people who go downtown. If they have their way, people like me would just disappear.''\nEven some of Newark's biggest civic boosters worry about outsize expectations after Mr. Booker's public pronouncements of the city's potential. (The mayor, a vegetarian, often talks about luring a Whole Foods market to the city.) And while Newark's overall crime rate dropped last year, homicides recently reached a 10-year high, hardly helping to improve its reputation.\n''The edge is so thin right now,'' said Alfred C. Koeppe, president of the Newark Alliance, a consortium of business leaders working to improve the economy and schools. ''All it takes is one kid who recently moved here to get shot on the way to the PATH train and it could be all over.''\nStill, urban experts say Newark, population 278,000, has an edge over other midsize cities still stumbling from the loss of their manufacturing bedrock. Just 10 miles from Manhattan and surrounded by wealthy suburbs, Newark is blessed with an expanding seaport, an international airport and a skein of highways and commuter rail lines.\nQuietly and with little fanfare, high-tech entrepreneurs have set up shop over the past decade at a 60-acre science park that is growing alongside the city's five colleges and professional schools. In October, the hockey arena is scheduled to join a decade-old performing arts center that has proved successful in drawing visitors to a downtown that otherwise feels like a disused Hollywood set after dusk.\n''The one thing that New Jersey lacks is a premier city,'' said Thomas K. Wright, executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, which has helped formulate redevelopment plans for a number of struggling cities in New York's orbit. ''This is Newark's moment to become that city. It's going to happen in the next few years. Or it won't.''\nDirecting Mr. Booker's economic development efforts is Stefan Pryor, a friend from Yale Law School who led efforts to revive Lower Manhattan after 9/11. Now, as one of Newark's three deputy mayors, Mr. Pryor has been hawking Newark to national retailers, streamlining the way City Hall doles out licenses and building permits, and trying to create a new Planning Department to replace a politicized, fragmented one that developers say often stymied projects.\n''In the past you had to do back flips and jump through rings of fire,'' Mr. Pryor said at a recent Chamber of Commerce breakfast where he gave a presentation of the streamlined permit process. ''This is a new era. We're going to be the new high-integrity folks at City Hall who you can talk to with intelligence.''\nMr. Pryor, 34, recently moved from Manhattan to an Art Deco tower a few blocks off Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard that has become a highly visible symbol -- and test -- of Newark's aspirations. Vacant for 20 years, the building at Raymond Boulevard and Broad Street is being transformed into 317 apartments, and will feature valet parking, a mod bowling alley and a yoga studio. The average rent for a two-bedroom is $2,500; the building is still under renovation, but half the finished apartments have been rented.\nA year from now, the landlord, Cogswell Realty Group, plans to break ground nearby on a project that would bring 2,900 units to a stretch of Broad Street now dominated by abandoned department stores. The company sees its markets as college students who currently commute to Newark, young professionals priced out of Manhattan and empty-nesters seeking an urban experience without depleting their savings.\n''When we started this 18 months ago, there were plenty of people who thought we wouldn't sign a single lease or that we wouldn't get the rents we're getting,'' Arthur Stern, Cogswell's chief executive, said during a tour of the health club in the Art Deco building. ''I think we've proven everyone wrong.''\nMr. Pryor was among the first to move in, as much to make a statement about the area's viability as for the five-minute walk to work. Unpacking boxes in his 15th-floor apartment one recent evening, he gazed out at City Hall's gold-leaf dome and the fast-rising arena. Then his eye settled on the darkened 19th-century mercantile buildings in the foreground. ''I'm hoping we can inject these buildings with some life,'' he said.\nTo that end, Mr. Pryor soon plans to ask the City Council to eliminate stringent zoning rules that have made it difficult to get approval to renovate the upper floors of commercial buildings. Another major goal is revamping the city's master plan, which has not been updated in 50 years. In a city with no bookstores and just two supermarkets, he spends most of his days on the phone with retailers and restaurateurs, talking up the untapped spending power of Newark residents.\nBusiness leaders and politicians alike say such retail -- and residential -- development depends in part on the 50,000 students and teachers whose lives revolve around Seton Hall Law School, Rutgers University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Essex County College and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.\nOnce largely commuter schools, their academic buildings walled off from the surrounding city, these five institutions have been building furiously, constructing new dormitories that, by the fall semester, will house 4,000 students in and around downtown.\n''People don't think of Newark as a college town, but I think that's about to change,'' said Gene A. Vincenti, executive vice provost at Rutgers-Newark, at the school's new $50 million administrative building, part of a $210 million capital improvement plan.\nUp the hill from Rutgers, in a futuristic, four-story building, a biophysicist was busy working on a new ultraviolet system to treat psoriasis and purify drinking water, while a former telecommunications executive plotted the rollout of software that uses a computer-generated voice to read e-mail messages over the phone. Others in the so-called Newark Innovation Zone were creating facial recognition software for security firms and technologies that can detect biological agents in luggage.\nStarted 10 years ago, the zone -- also known as University Heights Science Park -- is one of three technology incubators in the state, with 60 start-ups and scores of lone entrepreneurs who enjoy cheap office space, free business advice and monthly networking lunches. There is a waiting list of several months, so this year organizers plan to build another 100,000-square-foot building, christened the Digital Century Center. A separate stem-cell research center is on the drawing board.\nThe lofty dream, those running the incubator say, is to turn the surrounding area into a high-tech manufacturing zone that could employ thousands of people. ''The idea is to make these things here, and create more than just jobs for a bunch of Ph.D.'s and their secretarial and janitorial support staff,'' said Donald H. Sebastian a vice president of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the center's main sponsor.\nBut with almost a third of Newark's residents living in poverty, and the city's unemployment rate at 10 percent -- more than double New York City's rate and more than double New Jersey's average -- cynicism about such ideas abounds.\nRonnie Addy, who said he never finished high school and spent a year in jail for gun possession more than a decade ago, said he would ''love to work in an office'' someday, but has more or less given up looking for a job and survives on public assistance. ''I can't make ends meet flipping burgers and making minimum wage,'' said Mr. Addy, 44.\nAn associate professor of management and global business at Rutgers, dt ogilvie, said many of the chronically unemployed here needed the most basic training: how to dress for an interview, how to speak to an employer and how to handle disputes without storming out the door. ''We have plenty of willing workers in Newark,'' he said; ''a lot of them are just not equipped to work.''\nIndeed, down at the waterfront, where the business of unloading and loading cargo has doubled in the past decade, producing about 1,000 new jobs a year, nearly 80 percent of the 28,000 stevedore and truck driving positions are held by people who live outside the city. At Newark Liberty International Airport, the airlines hire hundreds of baggage handlers, flight attendants and reservation agents every month; few are from Newark.\nMayor Booker insists that City Hall will not ignore the city's poorest residents and frequently says he is trying to make the rehabilitation of former offenders like Mr. Addy a top priority.\nWith 1,500 to 2,000 parolees returning to Newark each year -- and 60 percent of them ending up in handcuffs again within three years, according to city officials -- the Booker administration plans to unveil a program next month that would provide ex-felons with job training and help them expunge their criminal records.\nDuring a recent City Hall meeting, when Mr. Pryor gushed about a flood of calls from potential investors, his counterpart in charge of minority economic empowerment, Michelle Thomas, flashed an expression of concern.\n''I'm worried people in the Central Ward will be upset if we emphasize downtown housing,'' Ms. Thomas said of the neighborhood that took the most damage from the 1967 riots. ''It's semantic, but people will care and there's potential for a backlash.''\nNodding, Mr. Booker said, ''We don't want to gentrify people out of the city,'' but he added that ''creating a 24/7 community means providing retail and jobs and these will be opportunities for Newark residents.''\nFrom the antiseptic hush of the high-tech park on its northern tip to the Hotel Riviera, where $10 buys a room for an hour, two miles south, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard is a jagged montage of Newark's grand history, nightmarish depths and nascent revival.\nNot far from the Riviera, and an abandoned housing project occupied by a small army of squatters, sits Hopewell Baptist Church, a 3,000-seat behemoth known to another generation as Temple B'nai Jeshurun. The Rev. Jason C. Guice struggles to keep the rain from destroying Hopewell's organ and to stop the termites from chewing the cherry-wood pews; last year, the sanctuary's huge Star of David chandelier shattered on the floor. The congregation runs a soup kitchen that feeds 300 people every Saturday, a nursing school for young women and a day care center for their children.\n''We haven't really arrived yet, but we're on our way,'' Mr. Guice said of both Newark and his church.\nMrs. Whigham, the funeral home owner, left Newark a few years ago for Livingston, an affluent suburb nine miles northwest.\nYes, she said, she has appreciated the tranquillity of sleeping behind windows without bars. But she misses the energy and rich history of her High Street.\n''This place is in my blood,'' she said.\nMrs. Whigham plans to turn one of the four brownstones her family owns on the boulevard into a mortuary-science school. And, this month, she plans to sell her house in Livingston and move back into the apartment above the funeral home.\nThe Hard Part\nThis is the third article in a series chronicling Mayor Cory A. Booker's first year in Newark City Hall.\nONLINE: Previous articles, and a multimedia walking tour of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard with Clement Price, a local historian:\nThe Hard Part
1816608	After 2 Years, Yankees Send Johnson Back To Arizona	2007-01-05	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E5DA1430F936A35752C0A9619C8B63	With every move they make, the Yankees are looking back to go forward. They traded Randy Johnson to the Arizona Diamondbacks yesterday, effectively returning the pitcher they could not live without just two years ago. They also signed a first baseman, Doug Mientkiewicz, who is better known for his glove than his bat.\nTeam officials confirmed the moves, but neither was announced, because the Diamondbacks must formalize a contract extension for Johnson and the Yankees must approve the results of Mientkiewicz's physical exam. But the thinking was consistent with the Yankees' approach this winter.\nIn shedding Johnson two months after trading outfielder Gary Sheffield, the Yankees have jettisoned two expensive players with lengthy résumés who failed to bring a World Series title to the Bronx. In return, they have helped restock a farm system that is suddenly flourishing.\nIn adding Mientkiewicz for one year and $1.5 million, the Yankees tightened their first-base defense after years of neglect. Jason Giambi, now a full-time designated hitter, has limited range and a poor arm, and Sheffield failed his brief audition at the end of last season. Mientkiewicz won a Gold Glove in 2001.\nIn exchange for Johnson, the Yankees will receive the veteran right-handed reliever Luis Vizcaíno and three prospects: the right-handers Ross Ohlendorf and Steven Jackson, and shortstop Alberto Gonzalez. The Yankees included $2 million to help offset Johnson's $16 million salary for 2007.\nAt 4 p.m. yesterday, the Diamondbacks began a 72-hour negotiating window with Johnson to complete the trade. Johnson will probably sign a contract for 2008 and could allow the Diamondbacks to revise their payment schedule for the deferred money owed him from his previous Arizona contract.\nJohnson went 34-19 over two seasons with the Yankees, making 67 starts despite persistent back pain that required surgery Oct. 26. But he often seemed uncomfortable in New York, and the Yankees sensed this winter that he would be happier returning to Arizona, where he lives and where he won four Cy Young awards for the Diamondbacks.\nGeneral Manager Brian Cashman called Johnson last month to express condolences after the death of Johnson's older brother. In that conversation, Johnson emphasized the importance of being closer to home.\nJohnson had no contractual right to demand a trade, and the Yankees could have kept him, hoping that he would be healthy enough to work his usual 200 innings. But succeeding in New York can be challenging, even for players who want to be there. If a player wants out, the Yankees believe it is best to accommodate him.\n''We're going to talk tomorrow morning, and our hope is that we can reach an agreement,'' Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, said last night.\nSo Johnson will move on, ending another mercenary's unfulfilled tenure in pinstripes. The Yankees have imported many stars since their last World Series victory, in 2000, but no combination has resulted in a championship.\nThis winter's restructuring has included the return of starter Andy Pettitte, a mainstay from the title teams who signed a one-year, $16 million contract. The Johnson deal also frees up money to sign the free agent Roger Clemens, who pitched in four World Series for the Yankees.\nClemens' agent, Randy Hendricks, has advised him to wait until midseason to return, a strategy that worked well in Houston last summer. The Yankees will let Clemens make his own timetable, but they are determined not to be outbid for him.\nThe Astros and the Red Sox also have interest in Clemens, but Clemens seems to have grown weary of the Astros' lack of run support. It would be surprising if Clemens chose to sign with Boston for a lower salary instead of returning to the Yankees, where he could remain teammates with Pettitte, his close friend.\nEven if they somehow lose out on Clemens, the Yankees found the Johnson deal appealing because of the players they received in return.\nVizcaíno, 32, ranks second in games pitched among right-handers during the past five seasons. He was 4-6 with a 3.58 earned run average last season, with more strikeouts than innings pitched over 70 games.\nThe Diamondbacks are flush with strong right-handers in their farm system; they released one, Brian Bruney, who played well for the Yankees late last season. Now the Yankees have two more in Ohlendorf and Jackson, both 24.\nOhlendorf, who has an economics degree from Princeton, was 10-8 with a 3.25 E.R.A. in 28 starts last season, all but one at Class AA Tennessee. Jackson, who pitched four seasons at Clemson, was 8-10 with a 2.65 E.R.A. in Class AA. Gonzalez, 23, hit .290 in Class AA last season and, like Ohlendorf, appeared briefly in Class AAA.\nThe Yankees acquired three minor league pitchers from Detroit in their November deal for Sheffield. After that trade, a writer from Baseball America listed the Yankees sixth among all teams for talent in their farm system. Last March, the magazine ranked them 17th.\nThe foundation of the Yankees' recent dynasty, from 1996 until Johnson beat them in relief in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series, came from their farm system. Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada, Bernie Williams and Pettitte were all homegrown. As Cashman tries to emphasize development again, Williams, 38, is probably on his way out. The Mientkiewicz deal ensures that the Yankees will not have a roster spot for Williams.\nCounting Mientkiewicz as one of nine everyday players, the bench will include backups in the infield, first base and at catcher, with Melky Cabrera as the reserve outfielder. The Yankees plan to carry 12 pitchers.\nMets Manager Willie Randolph admires Williams, who could try to stay in New York by signing with the Mets as a bench player. But the Mets, who are close to signing the reserve David Newhan, seem to like their bench as it is.\nBASEBALL\nCorrection: January 16, 2007, Tuesday A sports article on Jan. 5 about the trade that sent pitcher Randy Johnson from the Yankees to Arizona referred incorrectly to the college degree held by Russ Ohlendorf, a player the Yankees received from the Diamondbacks. He has a degree in operations research and financial engineering, not economics, from Princeton University.

She also said that every city should be forced to create emergency shelters for 1,000 people. France's numerous vacant investment lodgings ''will have to be rented,'' Ms. Royal said in her New Year's speech yesterday in Paris, which was broadcast on national television. ''To do that, lodgings unoccupied for more than two years will be surcharged and local governments will be given the chance'' to acquire or requisition them.

Rod R. Blagojevich, seeking to obtain copies of subpoenas issued to his office in a continuing federal investigation into hiring practices. The watchdog, the Better Government Association, asserted that the subpoenas, which it tried unsuccessfully to obtain last summer under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, were a matter of public record. But a spokeswoman for the governor's office, Abby Ottenhoff, said the administration had received clear instructions from prosecutors not to discuss or disclose any information related to subpoenas. Though Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat, has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation, his administration has been dogged by accusations of hiring fraud and a kickback scheme in a state pension program.\nLIBBY SANDER

Harry was a visionary and a leader in his 48 year career in the commodity industry. Starting as a clerk in the sugar business and ending as CEO of the New York Board of Trade, where he negotiated a $1.6 billion deal to combine BYBOT with The Intercontinental Exchange, the wide-ranging influence of his work will be felt far beyond his lifetime.

1816642	Pursuing Writers, but Letting Them Lead the Chase	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E5D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Paris Review Interviews, I Introduction by Philip Gourevitch 510 pages. Picador (paperback). $15.\nOpinions at length grow ugly, and so does talking about yourself: two traps the journalistic interview can fall into. One way out is to arm it with a needle of challenge. The subject, instead of standing to pronounce from a podium, is led to scurry, dodge and perhaps fight back, displaying paces and not just poundage.\nRarer is the interview that intends to produce a portrait and actually succeeds. For this you need an interviewer more disposed to follow than to capture. You need sufficient time and space, since too brief a chase reveals more about the aims of the pursuer than about the character of the pursued. And finally, in the procession of answers, you need alertness to the answer that hints at a life half-hidden and stimulates a question that gets it to emerge, shake itself and look around.\nAll this may sound like prescriptive theory. In fact, it is a descriptive conclusion, suggested by 16 pieces taken from the most remarkable and extensive interviewing project we possess. For 50 years The Paris Review has been talking to writers, in one long session, or several sessions, or recurring sessions spaced years apart. The first talk in this collection -- there are to be two other volumes -- is with Dorothy Parker, from 1956; the last, from 2006, is with Joan Didion. In between we get Ernest Hemingway, T. S. Eliot, Jorge Luis Borges, Rebecca West and Elizabeth Bishop, among others.\nIt would give a poor idea of their quality to call them ''in depth,'' with its suggestion of a reader being interred as a writer is being dug up. No doubt the phrase applies to a couple: a meticulous self-examination delivered (and carefully revised) by Saul Bellow; Robert Stone's protracted chewing of his writer's cud.\nFor the most part, though, ''The Paris Review Interviews, I'' is a series of excursions, alternately purposeful and capricious, with side trips, stops for tea and mystifications (Borges providing an extensive mystification, in the course of which he disappears gravely and drolly into one of his fictions, and emerges with perfect clarity). We end up knowing them not as subjects but as fellow day-trippers, and it is they, not the interviewer, who lead the trip.\nParker, decades past her scintillating Round Table fame, is seen in her shabby hotel apartment, strewn with lamb bones tossed to her poodle. (Each interview is preceded by its setting; a set, rather, on which a brief theater unfolds.) No self-pity, but an acid look back. She was the celebrity as wit; people would start to laugh even before she spoke. ''I should have had more sense.'' It wasn't real wit, anyway. ''Wit has truth in it; wisecracking is simply calisthenics with words.''\nThe young Truman Capote floats faunlike around a house strewn with kicky oddities that ''somehow remind you of the contents of a very astute little boy's pockets.'' Writing is style, according to Capote: rhythm, paragraphing, punctuation. (''Henry James is the maestro of the semicolon.'') It is important to have an emotion but to write only after it's gone: coldly. The reader, 50 years later, thinks of a bloated Capote, style gone the way of emotion.\nHemingway in 1958 is a jangle of attitudes. ''The best writing is certainly when you are in love.'' Best advice for a would-be writer: ''He should go out and hang himself because he finds that writing well is impossibly difficult. Then he should be cut down without mercy and forced by his own self to write as well as he can for the rest of his life.''\nGertrude Stein's influence on his style? She learned to write dialogue from ''The Sun Also Rises.'' The influence of Max Perkins, his editor? ''I liked the way he wore his hat.'' And, wearily: ''Ask old, tired questions and you'll get old, tired answers.'' The interviewer struggles to get past the pre-set buttons, but perhaps no longer is there anywhere past them. (William Blake: ''Ah sunflower weary of time.'')\nOther interviews are fresher. Robert Gottlieb, the editor of a whole galaxy of writers, chose to embroider upon comments (admiring) they sent in. The result is a wittily perceptive account of inciting, encouraging and sometimes curbing a menagerie of sensitivities, doubts and arrogances, to wring from them the best writing they could do. He virtually became the manuscript:\n''You have to surrender to a book. If you do, when something in it seems to be going askew, you are wounded.'' The editor as the canary in the mine, whose job is to expire when the air goes bad.\nThe most entrancing pieces are the most unexpected. Elizabeth Bishop, platinum-keen in her poetry and irremediably diffident, speaks of hesitating to identify herself: ''There's nothing more embarrassing than being a poet, really.''\nThe ostensibly dry and austere T. S. Eliot responds with clarity and warmth. He discusses his poetry as if it were written by someone else, a someone of whom he is rather fond. Some of his earlier writing was obscure, he admits, and suggests that young poets can be difficult to make out just because they want to express more than they know how: ''In 'The Waste Land' I wasn't even bothering whether I understood what I was saying.''\nHe is solicitous with his young interviewer, Donald Hall, now poet laureate of the United States. Does he have any advice for studying literature at Cambridge? Woolly underwear. How pleasant -- and quite counter to his celebrated line -- to know Mr. Eliot.\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES
1816643	Hard Epilogue to 'Freedom Writers': A Violent Death	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E2D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Hollywood endings aren't always simple.\nNot one of the 150 disadvantaged high school students Erin Gruwell started teaching more than a decade ago in Long Beach, Calif., has been killed in street violence. Many have gone on to college and graduate school. Some are now teachers themselves.\nTheir inspiring story is told in ''Freedom Writers,'' which opened yesterday to generally favorable reviews, starring Hilary Swank as the young, white Ms. Gruwell. It portrays her classroom trials and triumphs with black, Latino and Asian students, some from the area's most violent neighborhoods.\nBut death did come, with the blast of a gun, to one of the young actors cast as a student in the movie. Armand Jones, who plays Grant Rice, died in the lobby of a Denny's restaurant early on the morning of March 17. Mr. Jones was an ambitious, bright-eyed 18-year-old whose dreams of a career in entertainment were starting to come true with his role in the movie.\nAccording to police officers in Anaheim, about 20 miles east of Long Beach, he had joined a number of youths who had left a local nightclub and were congregating at the restaurant. Mr. Jones was robbed of a necklace in the bathroom. He and a friend confronted the suspect in the parking lot, police said. A gun was drawn, and Mr. Jones was shot. He staggered back into the restaurant and died.\nThe case received a flurry of local news media attention at the time, but not because Mr. Jones had recently finished filming ''Freedom Writers.'' It was of local interest because it was the third shooting death in a month at a Denny's in Southern California. Police officials said the three shootings were not related.\nNo arrests have been made in Mr. Jones's death, said Rick Martinez, an Anaheim police spokesman.\nMeanwhile, the tears over Mr. Jones have eased but not stopped.\nMany of the actors in ''Freedom Writers'' were cast after a talent search at high schools in poor Los Angeles neighborhoods. The film's casting director, Margery Simkin, started crying while discussing Mr. Jones by phone on Wednesday, the day before the movie's premiere.\n''There were 1,500 people at his funeral,'' Ms. Simkin said.\nWhen she and Richard LaGravenese, the writer and director of ''Freedom Writers,'' first watched the movie's promotional trailer a few months after Mr. Jones's death, they saw him in it and both started sobbing. Ms. Simkin said that Mr. LaGravenese recalled a scene from the film in which Ms. Gruwell asks her students to step on a line she has drawn down the middle of the classroom if any of them knew someone who had died in gang violence.\n''Richard looked at me and said, 'Now I can step on the line,' '' Ms. Simkin said.\nMr. LaGravenese's movie is based on a 1999 book, ''The Freedom Writers Diary,'' a collection of journal entries written by students in Ms. Gruwell's English classes. It was through sharing their diary entries with one another that they began overcoming the racial tensions that marked their lives.\nSome of that inspiration has affected the actors who play the original Freedom Writers.\nTwo years before getting the part of Marcus Jefferson, Jason Finn, now 20, was shot by a stranger because, Mr. Finn speculated, he was wearing basketball shorts with a gang color not welcome in the neighborhood he was in. By 2005, Mr. Finn was homeless, after his mother moved to Memphis and he had a dispute with his father.\nIn high school, Mr. Finn said, he had never had a teacher like Ms. Gruwell, who helped her students focus on achieving high goals. The movie came along, and he found that focus.\n''The whole time making this movie,'' he said by phone on the morning of the premiere, ''I'm telling myself: 'Man, am I going to get into a fight, or come in with a black eye, or am I going to go to jail? Am I going to mess this up?' Up until the movie, it was really hard for me to finish things.''\nAfter his last scene was shot, he was so proud, he rushed to a corner of the set and wept, he said.\nMr. Jones's death was tough for Mr. Finn. ''I can't tell you how I came to peace with it, but I came to peace with it,'' he said. ''I felt the anger building up inside me, and I just told myself it was meant to be.''\nMs. Gruwell, 37, said the shooting death of Mr. Jones, who was from Long Beach, made the film's plot ''more real.''\n''It shows us that the story is not over,'' she said, while preparing for the premiere. ''There's still gang violence, there's still murder, there's still intolerance.''\nSergio Montalvo, 17, who plays Alejandro Santiago, said he had not known Mr. Jones well, but that he had known ''roughly 15 to 20 people'' who have died in gang violence.\nMr. Montalvo said he gave his entire first paycheck and part of every check thereafter during the filming of ''Freedom Writers'' to his family, which has been homeless in the past.\nMr. Montalvo had awakened at 4:30 a.m. on Thursday to exercise. He gets up that early, he said, every other day to try to lose the weight he put on eating all the catered food on the film set.\nThere's a lesson, he added, in going from sleeping on a church floor to acting in a Hollywood movie: ''The sky isn't the limit. There's so much more out there.''\nHis family continues to live in the crime-ridden South Central neighborhood in Los Angeles. Mr. Montalvo's wages as an actor on one film were not enough to change their lives completely.\n''I really hope I get another film, a really big film,'' he said. ''I want to take my family out of the neighborhood. I don't want them to go through any more pain.''
1816644	A Little Folk, a Little Rock And a Lot of Minimalism	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E2D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	White Magic is an entity in flux. It began in 2004 as a trio, led by the singer and keyboardist Mira Billotte. Then it became a duo, with Ms. Billotte and the guitarist Doug Shaw. For now it's a shambly, spooked quartet, not quite folk and not quite rock, and as such it played with the bassist Brad Truax and the drummer Jim White on Thursday night at the Mercury Lounge.\nMs. Billotte is the focal point, and her voice was affect-free and handsome: restrained despite a big range, and forthright enough in long tones. She hasn't had a lot of time in the sunlight, and her performance was carefully unstagy, in a kind of indeterminate zone. One step further, and she could be interestingly antisocial; one step back, and she'd be boring.\nWhite Magic owes quite a lot to Cat Power, alias the singer-songwriter Chan Marshall, who has been very effective with very little. And so a White Magic song is built on hardly anything: an unsyncopated vocal pattern, uncertain keyboard technique, shorthand lyrics (''who we are/how we live/all that has to do with innocence/has grown apart'') and very, very few piano notes.\n''Childhood Song'' has three, at least for a long stretch. ''The Light'' has two. It's juvenile and frustrating: Ms. Billotte is in control of her performance and knows how to write a song; she's holding back, or going childlike on purpose.\nBut those two songs -- from White Magic's good new record, its first full-length album, ''Dat Rosa Mel Apibus'' (Drag City) -- were the best parts of Thursday's show. Ms. Billotte made her vocal melodies carry the tunes, and the four musicians leaned into the music, imposing their wills on it. Mr. Shaw played skeletal guitar chords and undernourished, echoey leads; Mr. Truax played minimally and cleanly. And then there was Jim White, the drummer. Let's talk about Jim White.\nMuch of the grace in the best not-quite-rock, not-quite-folk music since the mid-1990s -- Cat Power, Beth Orton, Smog, Dirty Three, Nina Nastasia, Bonnie Prince Billy -- is attributable to Mr. White, who played with them all. On Thursday he tuned in: he watched and listened like a demon. He held his sticks way down at the bottom, raised his arms up high, and let the weight of the stick coming down determine the size and character of the beats. He played simple, unusual patterns in midtempo grooves that were perfect for this music -- not too put-together, but giving it the support it needed.\n(Without him, Ms. Billotte and Mr. Shaw opened the show by themselves, performing a two-guitar version of the old folk song ''Katie Cruel,'' learned from a very obscure Karen Dalton record; the gesture was stout, but the performance was anemic.)\nThis was deeply deceptive music, driving toward something not altogether satisfying but still fascinating: a deadpan warmth, a halfhearted bliss.\nMUSIC REVIEW
1816645	X-Ray Vision Would Be Nice, But Sometimes a Nudge Will Do	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E1D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Most bridge deals would cease to be interesting if everyone knew where all of the cards were located -- what is called playing double-dummy. If declarer could peek into his opponents' hands, he would almost always make his contract. But since he is not blessed with X-ray vision, sometimes the defenders can nudge declarer off the road to Rome and onto a dead end.\nThe diagramed deal, from the Swiss Teams at the Edgar Kaplan Winter Regional in Midtown Manhattan last Saturday, is one of those deals.\nThe winners were Franco Baseggio, John Diamond, Jim Krekorian and Andrew Stark of New York. The runners-up were John Fout, Michael Kopera and John Rengstorff of New York and William Ehlers of West Orange, N.J. Third were Rozanne and Bill Pollack of Basking Ridge, N.J.; Martin Fleisher of New York; and Michael Kamil of Holmdel, N.J.\nWhat do you think of North's one-spade opening bid?\nDistributional hands are worth much more than their face value if a fit is found. The drawback with opening this hand is the potential difficulty in showing both suits. If North had, for example, the majors, it would be much easier. Some would pass, planning to make a two-suited bid on the next round. And a few would open one club, but it is dangerous not to mention a five-card major immediately. If, for example, West bids hearts, North passes, and East raises to four hearts, this hand is not strong enough unilaterally to compete with four spades.\nBoth auctions were effectively the same, although at the other table Stark (North) rebid two hearts to show a normal two-spade rebid, and Baseggio (South) bid three no-trump over three clubs. West led the heart king, asking his partner either to unblock an honor or to give count. (This was dangerous without the heart ten. If East had played the queen from a three- or four-card suit, it might have sacrificed the setting trick.)\nHere, though, East signaled an even number of hearts by playing his five. Now West shifted to a spade. Baseggio took the trick on the board and ran the diamond ten. West won with the queen and persevered with his second spade, but declarer won on the board and played a diamond to his jack. West, after winning with his king, cashed the heart ace, and South claimed the remainder. The defenders took two hearts and two diamonds.\nKrekorian (West) led the heart ace, asking for an attitude signal. When Diamond (East) played a discouraging deuce, West wondered how East could gain the lead to push a heart through South's queen.\nWest shifted to the club queen, playing his partner for three to the jack.\nThe operation was a success, and the declarer did die, but he might have lived. If South had won with his club king and returned a club to dummy's ten, he would have made his contract. The defenders could have taken only three hearts and one club.\nBut declarer decided it was better to play on diamonds. He won the second trick with dummy's club ace, then ran the diamond ten. Now, with careful defense, the contract would always fail. West won with his diamond queen and led a second club to South's king. Declarer took his five spade tricks, but West kept the heart king, two diamonds and a club. South, sensing what was happening, played a diamond to his ace, hoping to drop the king, and conceded down one.\nPlus 400 and plus 50 gave the winners 10 international match points on the board.\nBRIDGE
1816646	Hey, Young Writers, That's Mr. Rolling Stone to You	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E1D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	There must have been a time when Jann Wenner was scrappy and wild -- the kind of guy who bet his career on Hunter S. Thompson and begged, borrowed and stole to create a San Francisco rocker magazine called Rolling Stone. That time was 1967, 40 years ago.\nBut today Mr. Wenner is famous for bottom lines, discipline, US Weekly and draconian office inspections, during which he has his employees' desks examined for violations of obscure pencil-storage codes.\nThis rigidity is a well-known component of Mr. Wenner's sensibility. But like so much else about him and his business, it has apparently escaped the Google capacities of the six young writers who appear tomorrow night on MTV's reality competition ''I'm From Rolling Stone.''\nThese six are hoping to score a yearlong position as contributing editor at Mr. Wenner's magazine. But without exception, on tomorrow night's episode, they greet the venerable and famous editor, when he calls to offer them a tryout, with a familiarity and an informality that seem almost hostile. They call him ''Jann,'' ''man,'' ''skater'' and perhaps worst of all, ''Ian.'' No one says, ''Mr. Wenner.'' No one refrains from squealing or shrieking.\nThis wince-inducing sensibility clash is highlighted as MTV's camera hustles between the improvised rooms of the contestants -- mostly chaotic condos and dorms -- and Mr. Wenner's sleek, high-altitude, Venetian-blinded conference room. The out-of-town perception of Rolling Stone as a cool, loose, groovy place for rock stars is simply way off the mark. Just as candidates for jobs at investment banks might want to show a little personality, candidates for jobs at Rolling Stone (if this show teaches viewers anything) might want to show a little less.\nOn the other hand, this is television we're watching, and not a magazine we're running. Personality is good, as are vivid personality clashes. What's more, this is television's reality competition for writers, and ''I'm From Rolling Stone'' suggests that, like fashion designers and chefs, writers make superb reality characters; they're weird and talkative. In this way they're unlike network reality characters -- the ''Apprentice'' and ''Bachelor'' crew -- who are pharmaceutical reps or real estate agents, but mostly cast for their looks.\nWriting, unfortunately, is not very telegenic -- nothing so exciting as cutting and sewing a dress and fitting a great-looking model into it. But reporting, especially when that means interviewing rock stars, that at least looks pretty good on TV. ''I'm From Rolling Stone'' promises air time with the Shins, Snoop Dogg and Lionel Richie -- and it must have been comforting to the producers to know they had those staple MTV faces to use in promoting the show if the reality junk didn't pan out.\nBut it seems to have panned out. The contestants appear to know something about music, and at least two of them seem to have talent as writers on the first two episodes. Of these two, Russell Morse, a onetime juvenile delinquent from San Francisco with some newspaper experience, seems picked to win. He's credibly hip but focused and not overly thrilled about being ''from Rolling Stone.'' (Early on, he coolly tells a publicist, or someone, that he's ''Russell Morse, over at Rolling Stone magazine.'' Ghostface Killah, whom he interviews, responds to him, as do others.)\nSo maybe the contest belongs to Russell. It's unlikely to go to Krishtine, who's more performer than writer, or Peter, who's represented as a problem drinker. Colin, who believes ''Boho'' is a nickname for Brooklyn, is likable, but he's a shambles as a reporter.\nKrystal is beautiful and ambitious; one of her ambitions, however, seems to be to sleep with Steven Tyler. Promos of forthcoming episodes suggest that Russell's competition will be Tika, an earnest young woman from Buffalo who is first seen with her family in the grand old borough of Boho.\nBut I worry for Russell. Reality television is pretty rulebound, and it works by upsets. If Russell is the lead after the first and second episode, that almost guarantees there's trouble for him ahead. Besides, he's the one who asked the fastidious founder of Wenner Media if he should bring ''socks, underwear and condoms'' to New York. Reality television is also moralistic, and surely there will be a comeuppance for that.\nI'm From Rolling Stone MTV, Sunday night at 10, Eastern and Pacific times; 9, Central time.\nJacquelyn M.

1816647	City Ballet Brings Passion To Podium	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE1D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	As the house lights dimmed in the New York State Theater last Saturday night before Act II of George Balanchine's ''Nutcracker,'' the conductor, Fayçal Karoui, turned around and presented a red rose to a woman in the first row. Mr. Karoui became the New York City Ballet's music director on Dec. 1, and his tenure seems to have started with a flourish. Earlier he had given each female player in the orchestra a rose for the end of the ''Nutcracker'' season, and upon finding a spare flower on his podium, he appeared to see no point in letting a chance for a charming gesture go to waste.\nAll of this seems natural for Mr. Karoui, whose conducting style is almost dancerly in its physical flamboyance and who is -- there is no avoiding the description -- tall, dark and handsome. He is also French, possessing pitch-perfect Gallic-accented English and given to drollery and dramatic gesticulation.\n''It is our honeymoon right now, and I hope it lasts for a long time,'' Mr. Karoui said, speaking of his relationship with his new orchestra in his unadorned lounge backstage. (He assured those present that it would look a lot better soon: ''They are going to paint it, and this bookshelf'' -- expressive grimace -- ''it will go'').\nCity Ballet's search for a new music director began more than two years ago, when the incumbent director, Andrea Quinn, told the company's balletmaster in chief, Peter Martins, that she intended to return to her native Britain in 2006 for family reasons. The position is important at any large ballet company, but the job perhaps holds particular weight at City Ballet, with its unusually broad musical repertory and Balanchine-derived belief in the primacy of the music. (The composer's name is still printed above the choreographer's in the programs.)\n''When Peter proposed this job to me, I don't think I realized how big it is,'' Mr. Karoui said. ''The repertory is fantastic; you could play the music as concert programs. In January I will conduct an all-Stravinsky program; these are works that are monuments in the symphonic repertoire, that wouldn't exist if we didn't have these ballets. I cannot hear the reputation that ballet has in some music circles -- that you have to compromise all the time. I say, no, you compromise more for opera.''\nMr. Karoui (his name is pronounced FAY-sal KAH-wee), 35, has, in fact, conducted more symphonies and operas than ballets in his short but illustrious career. He grew up in the Val-de-Marne region just outside Paris, in a family he describes as ''not particularly musical.'' But his Tunisian-born father and French mother, both doctors, did have a piano, and Mr. Karoui, along with his identical twin brother and younger sister, took lessons.\n''I would love to say that I was conducting in my apartment at 5 years old,'' he said, ''but I actually can't remember when I decided to be a musician.''\nAlthough he studied the piano seriously with the concert pianist Catherine Collard, Mr. Karoui began working toward a mathematics degree at Paris University's Jussieu campus after graduating from high school, ''as insurance,'' before being accepted at the selective and prestigious Conservatoire National Supérieur de Paris. Soon after, he decided to focus on conducting.\n''There's a human dimension to working with an orchestra that you don't have as a soloist,'' he said.\nAfter graduating from the conservatory in 1997 with the first prize in conducting, he won a scholarship that allowed him to work with Michel Plasson, one of France's most eminent conductors and the director of the well-known Orchestre National du Capitole in Toulouse.\n''I was the assistant, so they had to give me something to do,'' he said. ''So it was a ballet, something unimportant, just 'The Sleeping Beauty,' '' he said, poker-faced. ''I just loved it.''\nAfter five years working with Mr. Plasson and guest-conducting all over France, Mr. Karoui was invited by André Labarrère, the mayor of Pau in the southwest, to form a new symphony orchestra.\n''It was an amazing opportunity,'' Mr. Karoui said. ''I'm young and I'm fed up hearing that music is for the rich, the 'cultured.' Music itself is not elitist. In Pau we could do something different. We spoke to the public about the pieces before every concert; we performed in jails and schools; we mixed repertory and new work; we did a breakfast series for children. I wanted to create bridges, and it really worked.''\nDuring a stint guest-conducting performances by the Paris Opera Ballet School, Mr. Karoui met Richard Tanner, a balletmaster at City Ballet, who recommended him to Mr. Martins after he had begun his search for Ms. Quinn's successor.\n''I was immediately impressed with him,'' Mr. Martins said in a telephone interview. ''We looked at over 15 conductors, and he was very different from everyone else. He struck me as very impassioned, which I liked. He was everywhere -- watching rehearsals he didn't have to be at, at the school, saying how fantastic everything was. And the musical staff gave him glowing reports.''\nMr. Karoui, who remains associated with the Orchestre de Pau, has ambitious plans at City Ballet. His job is not simply to rehearse and conduct the orchestra, but also to schedule the roster of house and guest conductors needed during ballet seasons, help to plan repertory programs and the musical direction of new productions and work closely with the dancers and balletmasters. But his biggest goal, he said, is to develop morale by occasionally taking the orchestra out of the pit.\n''Of course the orchestra is here for the ballet, but when you play 46 'Nutcrackers,' you can forget that you are important,'' he said. ''There are already short concerts before the Sunday matinee; I want to expand that, do concertos with a larger group, perhaps have education sessions where the full orchestra will be onstage. It's not a question of competing with the Philharmonic, but simply showing the public that they have faces and are wonderful musicians.''\nMr. Karoui is watching the dancers take class almost every morning (''I love that,'' he said. ''Maybe I'll join in soon'') and settling into his new apartment near Lincoln Center. Asked how he feels about the forthcoming visit of Valery Gergiev, the renowned conductor and director of the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, who is to conduct the company on Feb. 23, Mr. Karoui appeared -- for the first time -- at a loss for words.\n''I simply can't believe it's true that he'll come,'' he said. ''He is a genius, perhaps the best conductor in the world. I'm just excited that our photographs are on the same page in the company newsletter.''
1816648	For This Broadway Musical, the Casting Agents Are TV Viewers	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE1D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	In almost every way, ''You're the One That I Want,'' the ''American Idol''-like reality show in which viewers pick actors to play Sandy Dumbrowski and Danny Zuko in a Broadway production of ''Grease,'' was inevitable.\nFirst, the show's British relative -- ''How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?'' which was aimed at finding a Maria for a West End production of ''The Sound of Music'' -- definitely did something good. ''Maria,'' the brainchild of Andrew Lloyd Webber, drew millions of viewers; the winner, Connie Fisher, was welcomed by the critics; and the West End production is making a mint.\n''You're the One,'' which has its premiere tomorrow night on NBC, is set up in the standard format for talent competitions. Contestants audition in front of three judges: David Ian, a producer of the revival (and a producer of ''The Sound of Music''); Kathleen Marshall, who will direct and choreograph the revival; and Jim Jacobs, one of the creators of ''Grease.'' The judges are shown narrowing the group down to 12 in the first few episodes; after that, the episodes are live, and the folks at home vote. Billy Bush narrates.\nBut ''You're the One'' was not simply a reaction to the success of ''Maria.'' In fact, BBC Worldwide pitched ''Maria'' to several American networks before it began broadcasting the show in Britain, said Craig Plestis, the senior vice president for alternative programming for NBC.\nUnlike ''The Sound of Music,'' though, a production of ''Grease'' was already lined up for Broadway. Mr. Ian, who produced a long-running revival of ''Grease'' in London, had been trying to bring a production of ''Grease'' to Broadway for years. (A revival produced by Fran and Barry Weissler closed in 1998.) Nederlander Presentations and Mr. Ian -- along with Mr. Ian's partner Paul Nicholas and Phoenix Productions -- eventually worked out a deal to put it on in 2008.\nMr. Ian had also been trying, like many others, to persuade Ron Taft, a lawyer who manages the rights for ''Grease,'' to make the audition process into a reality show.\n''Right after 'American Idol,' I get calls from everyone saying, 'Let's do an ''American Idol'' to cast ''Grease.'' ' Every time I just say no,'' Mr. Taft said.\nLast spring Mr. Taft and Mr. Jacobs finally agreed to the idea. BBC Worldwide and NBC went forward with the television show, and the Nederlander organization and Mr. Ian moved up the Broadway production to the summer of 2007. The current plan is for ''Grease'' to open, with its already famous stars, in August at the Brooks Atkinson theater.\nUnlike ''Idol,'' ''You're the One'' is not supposed to be exclusively an amateur night. The rules of ''Idol'' require that contestants not have any current contracts or talent representation; ''You're the One,'' on the other hand, is simply an open casting call, for novices as well as active Broadway performers. A prospective Danny in the first episode, for example, has several national tours under his belt.\nBut that is part of the show's tricky balancing act. Reality television producers and viewers still love the nobody from nowhere who wins it all; the first episode puts heavy (and at times, teary) emphasis on the contestants' personal stories. But the winners also have to hold up a $10 million musical eight times a week for at least a year, a demanding feat for a total greenhorn.\n''We absolutely would love for a carpenter from Idaho to be Danny,'' said Al Edgington, the executive producer of the television show. ''But the reality is, they have to be able to perform. If the carpenter from Idaho does end up being Danny, Kathleen may be in trouble.''\nIf ''You're the One'' has any of the success that ''Maria'' has, there will be a lot of happy producers, in both theater and TV land. But the question will then become: what next?\nThough it may not be in every avid theater fan's Top 10 list, ''Grease'' fits the project in ways few other musicals do. The lead characters are young, and there is flexibility in the race of the actors portraying them. The soundtrack is rock 'n' roll, and the characters drive fast cars and look sexy in leather jackets. Most important, ''Grease'' was made into a movie that has become part of the popular culture, featuring two stars who made it big (for a while, at least).\nExecutives involved with the television show said there were discussions about what to do next, but no one was quick with a suggestion.\n''I don't know what the obvious one is,'' Mr. Edgington said. ''Maybe there's a way of recasting 'Grease' every year.''\nThere is always ''The Sound of Music,'' which also has a movie going for it. In Britain Mr. Lloyd Webber is working on another television show that will cast the leads of a revival of ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'' (There is also going to be a show, from Simon Cowell's production company, that will cast Danny and Sandy in a London production of ''Grease.'' David Ian will be a judge on that show as well.)\nMr. Plestis said that there had been talks with Mr. Lloyd Webber but that, for now, NBC was focusing on making ''Grease'' work.
1816649	'The OC': A Fast Start, A Faster Finish	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The end was in sight for ''The OC'' by at least last summer, according to Josh Schwartz, the wunderkind creator of the show that, with its glamorous locations, beautiful actors and hip soundtrack, defined new trends for music, fashion, celebrity and, of course, television.\nAfter a stunning debut on Fox in 2003, in which the series drew nearly 10 million viewers each week and a particularly high number of adults between the ages of 18 and 34, according to Nielsen Media Research, the show's ratings fell in each of the last two seasons.\nIt entered the fourth season without its most recognizable face, the pouty rich girl played by Mischa Barton, who was killed off at the end of the previous season. Fox, meanwhile, demonstrated its lack of confidence by leaving ''The OC'' in its 9 p.m. Thursday time slot to face off against ''Grey's Anatomy'' and ''CSI.''\nFox ordered only 16 episodes, down from more than 20 in each of the first three seasons, and its budget for promoting the show's return, Mr. Schwartz said, made clear that hopes for the series this year were not high.\n''We tried to be realistic about it,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''Few shows get to have their last season be their best. So if this was going to be the last season, we wanted to write the show we wanted to do and the show the fans wanted to see. It was creatively liberating.''\nFox, for its part, declined to address its reasons for ending ''The OC.'' No network executives were quoted in the news release, issued on Wednesday, announcing that this season would be the show's last, and a spokesman for the network said Friday that no one would comment for this article.\nWhen ''The OC'' had its premiere, it was quickly compared to ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' ''Dawson's Creek'' and other series that drew raves for their chronicles of teenage angst. But while ''90210'' lasted 10 seasons, ''The OC'' will not even make it to the 100-episode milestone, considered a benchmark for profitable syndication.\nIt did, however, influence the culture. Orange County's Newport Beach community became a tourist destination for young fans. At least two reality-based television series drew on the fame of ''The OC'': ''Laguna Beach,'' an MTV series that billed itself as ''the real Orange County,'' and ''The Real Housewives of Orange County,'' a Bravo reality show that follows a gaggle of women from their tennis lessons to Botox sessions.\nThanks to its heavy use of mood music from emerging rock and alternative-music groups, ''The OC'' became known as a showcase for new bands, and it produced a half-dozen soundtrack albums featuring groups like Death Cab for Cutie and vocalists like Imogen Heap.\nFor all of its focus on good-looking rich kids, the show was also about adults, winning praise for developing parental characters with their own storylines and concerns. The show also created what were arguably the first Jewish heartthrobs on television: Sandy Cohen, played by Peter Gallagher, a public defender married to a wealthy gentile developer; and his son, Seth Cohen, played by Adam Brody, who dealt with his mixed religious heritage by promoting the family's adoption of Chrismukkah as its winter holiday celebration.\nReviewing the show's second-season premiere, Virginia Heffernan, a New York Times television critic, wrote: ''In tone, diction, fashion and music, Mr. Schwartz knows just how to keep it credible with its swooning fans. But he is also mindful of the strict rituals that define television drama, and his discipline in tightening the world he has created -- rather than giving in to impatience and blowing it apart -- is admirable.''\nIn the end, however, the weakness of ''The OC'' might have been that it was too much the product of one person, conceptually, if not in practice. Just 26 when Fox agreed to broadcast the show, Mr. Schwartz was the youngest person in network television history to create and produce his own one-hour series.\nHe worked furiously, writing or revising every episode of the first season and several in the first part of the second year. After that, he cut back, and while other longtime collaborators like Stephanie Savage continued to work closely on the show, many fans expressed the opinion that the second and third seasons did not match the originality of the first.\nMr. Schwartz disputes that. ''I really believe in my colleagues,'' he said, citing his particularly close association with Ms. Savage and Robert De Laurentiis, a show-business veteran who has served as an executive producer since the first season.\nIn fact, Mr. Schwartz will be producing a new series with Ms. Savage. The CW network has signed the pair for ''Gossip Girl,'' an hourlong teenage drama set in New York City and based on the book series of the same name. NBC, too, has signed Mr. Schwartz for a series, a dark comedy-drama titled ''Chuck,'' which Mr. Schwartz has developed with Chris Fedak.\nFor now, Mr. Schwartz, who grew up in Providence, R.I., not on the California coast, said he was focused on ''delivering the most satisfying finale we can'' for ''The OC.'' The remaining episodes will feature an unexpected pregnancy and more of the show's familiar love-triangle tussles. All of which could work to raise the size of the audience from the fewer than four million who have tuned in for each episode this season, according to Nielsen. But it is unlikely that the series will win any reprieve from what, for such early promise, could be viewed as an early death.
1816650	A Former Leader Returns, Taking a Different Path	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E0D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Can it be that absence actually does make the heart grow fonder? Or is it just that hearing Lorin Maazel's micromanipulations of the standard canon so regularly has made almost any guest conductor at the New York Philharmonic sound refreshing?\nOr perhaps Zubin Mehta's conducting has gained some depth during his more recent travels. Mr. Mehta's tenure as the Philharmonic's music director in the 1980s was, at least as I remember it, a time of charmless interpretation and indifferent music-making. And his return visits over the years have not significantly altered that impression.\nYet when he led the orchestra in Beethoven's Violin Concerto and Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps'' on Thursday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, Mr. Mehta drew the kind of incisive, rich-hued performance that many concertgoers despaired of hearing when he was conducting the orchestra week after week. ''Le Sacre,'' in particular, was a virtuosic performance, as notable for the suppleness of its quieter sections as for the brutal energy and brashness of its climactic dances.\nJudith LeClair, the orchestra's principal bassoonist, played the opening solo with minute shifts of color and dynamics to create a sense of hazy mystery. And Mr. Mehta tended to let the Stravinsky's gradually coalescing chaos of woodwind and brass writing build at a leisurely pace, so that sudden leaps into full-orchestra overdrive seemed all the more dramatic and shocking, familiarity notwithstanding.\nThere was plenty of purely visceral appeal, as there must be in ''Le Sacre.'' So much of that comes from the sheer power of the score itself that it can be easy to overlook the importance of precision within the most splendidly rambunctious passages. This illusion of cacophony must be shaped by a firm hand: in everything from rapid-fire trumpet phrases to the walloping full-orchestra chords that are the work's signature, ensemble unity is paramount, and Mr. Mehta and the players delivered that. The salient feature of Mr. Mehta's reading, though, was a clarity of texture that illuminated the inner workings of Stravinsky's scoring.\nPinchas Zukerman was the soloist in the Beethoven, to which he gave a warm if often generic performance. When he was at his best and most engaged, he brought the solo line to life with touches of rubato in his phrasing or a tightly focused vibrato applied to climactic passages. And he gave a lively account of the finale, with rich-toned, energetic support from Mr. Mehta and the orchestra.\nBetween those moments, if the performance wasn't the Beethoven of your dreams, it was never less than respectable.\nZubin Mehta will conduct the New York Philharmonic in the same program tonight and on Tuesday at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500.\nMUSIC REVIEW
1816651	In Its American Debut, a Band Stays Close to Home	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E0D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	''We were offered a chugging competition last night, because we're Scottish.'' So said Kieren Webster, more or less. He was onstage at the Mercury Lounge with his band, the View, which made its American debut on Tuesday after generating an unreasonable amount of excitement in Britain. The room was full of guest-listed industry professionals, all trying their best to decipher his Scottish brogue. (Thus, ''more or less.'')\nThis is a band known for neither modesty nor temperance, so what came next -- the conclusion of a short story about a long night in a downtown bar -- was doubly surprising. ''We lost,'' Mr. Webster said, with a shrug.\nA voice in the crowd celebrated the Scots' defeat by striking up a familiar chant: ''U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'' But Mr. Webster had heard that one before. ''That's what they said when they won,'' he said. And soon the band was hurtling through ''Wasteland,'' a bratty but affectionate ska-punk song about the lifestyles of the young and bored and Scottish.\nThe View is young: Mr. Webster, the bassist, and Pete Reilly, the lead guitarist, are 20; Kyle Falconer, the lead singer, and Steve Morrison, the drummer, are 19. They come from Dundee, near Scotland's east coast, and they have been a proper band for a bit more than a year. (Before that, they were a cover band.) But ''you'd be amazed at what you can achieve in a year,'' as one of their songs says. After their second real concert, they signed to an indie label, and then signed again, to 1965 Records, a new label distributed by Columbia and run by James Endeacott, known for his work with the Strokes and the Libertines.\nSoon the band's reputation spread far beyond Dundee. Two rousing singles, ''Superstar Tradesman'' and ''Wasted Little D.J.s,'' both reached No. 15 on the British pop chart. The British press piled on. (NME, the excitable rock weekly, called the band ''bloody marvelous.'') And now, with the anti-View backlash in full swing, the band is preparing to release its first album, ''Hats Off to the Buskers,'' which arrives in British shops on Jan. 22. The American version isn't due out until March 13, but a pirated version made its way online sometime last month.\nAs more than a few Internet-accessing fans have already discovered, the album is scruffy and quite likable. Mr. Falconer knows how to evoke teenage heedlessness. (Especially in the giddy, pig-Latin chorus of ''Wasted Little D.J.s'': ''Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day/I wish everyone could dance like them!'') But at other times, he sounds like a weary barfly twice his age. In ''Don't Tell Me,'' a sobered-up troublemaker hears about his ''late-night shenanigans'' for the first time: ''Refuse to believe what you just told me/Refuse to believe, till you tell me slowly/Or bring me down gradually.''\nPart of the View's appeal is songs that sound familiar and exotic at the same time. Familiar because the band's influences (the Beatles, the Clash and Oasis, for starters) won't surprise anyone, and neither will the band's obvious debt to the Libertines. (Pete Doherty -- formerly with the Libertines and currently with Babyshambles, Kate Moss and/or the police, depending on the day -- was an early supporter.) Between the band's bright melodies and Mr. Falconer's gloriously rolled r's, many listeners have detected hints of another cult band: the Undertones, from Northern Ireland, who were responsible (among other things) for the sublime 1978 hit ''Teenage Kicks.''\nAs for exotic, well, non-Dundee listeners are likely to be perplexed (and, with any luck, charmed) by the group's Scot-centric lyrics and thick accents. Mr. Falconer sneers at the notion of getting ''a house in the Ferry'' (presumably that's Broughton Ferry, a Dundee suburb); he sings about ''standing at the Dryburgh shop'' (referring to the housing developments that the members call home); he sings about meeting a girl at the Campbell Town bar, a Dundee pub. Compared with the cool, cosmopolitan young bands that regularly turn up in NME, the members of the View seem hopelessly -- that is, appealingly -- provincial.\nWhich doesn't mean naïve. On the contrary, the members have cannily traded on their reputation as local boys made good; in a recent interview with The Times of London, Mr. Morrison half-jokingly referred to his band as merely ''some gadgies from Dundee.'' (''Gadgie'' is one of those not necessarily disparaging, not quite translatable, regionally specific terms that the British use in place of ''guy'' or ''dude.'') And in songs like ''Posh Boys,'' a b-side that isn't on the album, Mr. Falconer not-so-subtly emphasizes his working-class identity.\nIf all of this sounds exotic in London, it sounds downright alien in America. Here rock bands aren't expected to have street credibility, and singing punk songs isn't usually seen as a good way to get out of the projects. Rappers routinely flaunt their hardscrabble upbringings, their tatty neighborhoods, their regional slang. But ambitious American rock bands tend to separate themselves by genre, not by class or geography. America's most tribal rock scenes (like 1980s hardcore punk) tend to be underground, and America's most popular bands tend to avoid tribalism. Fans probably know that Panic! at the Disco comes from Las Vegas, and Hinder comes from Oklahoma City, but neither of them sounds like a local band.\nIt's nearly impossible to discuss the View without also discussing the Arctic Monkeys, the Sheffield band that took Britain by storm a year ago. (They achieved only cult success in America; no doubt the executives at Columbia think the View can do better.) Like the Arctic Monkeys, the View is a young, scrappy band enjoying swift success, but that's where the comparison ends.\nWhereas the Arctic Monkeys are known for sharp, detailed lyrics, many of the View's songs rely on gesture and sentiment. (One couplet from ''Skag Trendy,'' about a heroin addict, goes, ''I wish somebody would love him/He doesn't have a home.'' This is, apparently -- and alarmingly -- not a joke.) And whereas Alex Turner, from the Arctic Monkeys, found ways to distance himself from the teenage culture he sung about, Mr. Falconer eagerly joins the fray: ''I'm gonna go to the disco in the middle of town/Everybody's dressing up, I'm dressing down.''\nThe band played twice at Mercury Lounge, on Tuesday and Wednesday, and neither show was as likable as the album. The playing was often careless (especially Mr. Webster's plink-plonk bass), and it was hard not to pine for an audience of screaming teenagers (preferably Scots) in place of the grown-up skeptics who packed the club. The band members had traveled to America from Dundee, fighting illness with treatments both medicinal and recreational, only to sound like -- well, like a shambling local band. That might be the whole idea, though it's hardly an idea likely to thrill American listeners.\nOne of the best songs on the album is ''Gran's for Tea,'' which wasn't part of either set. It's a playful little song that's even more localized than the others, and it begins in a fish-and-chip shop:\n''There's a milelong queue at the chippy, I wish I was at my Gran's for tea/These people call me their friend but they don't think the same as me.''\nThese Dundonians are developing a reputation as one of Britain's hardest-partying young bands, but sometimes you get the feeling they just want to go home.\nMUSIC\nCorrection: January 10, 2007, Wednesday A music column on Saturday about the View, a Scottish band from Dundee that made its American debut last week in New York, misstated the name of a Dundee suburb that one of its songs apparently refers to. It is Broughty Ferry, not Broughton Ferry.
1816652	A Blending of Euripides, Martial Arts and Noh	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E0D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Something must have happened to Company East's well-reviewed ''Medea'' on its way from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe to New York, where it opened on Thursday night for two weeks at La MaMa. Directed, choreographed and designed by Kenji Kawarasaki, this staging of ''Medea'' looked hastily put together and insubstantial, with a sudden last conceit suggesting some indecision about what it means to be.\nThe 75-minute production got off to an anomalous start with the stretching of a sleekly tapering leg into a perfect ballet developé and extension by Yoko Tomabechi's gauze-clad Glauce. Moments later the dancer slipped between handsomely colored panels, hanging from what looked like a laundry line, to enter into the dark stage space and narrative.\nThere were some striking visual images in this retelling of Euripides, which stays pretty close to tradition until the end and incorporates Japanese and English text as well as movement. Jin Nakayama's lighting designs make the most of a simple technical setup, and the uncredited score is as adroit a blend of styles as the choreography, which draws from Noh theater, modern dance and martial arts. The costumes, chiefly brilliantly colored metallic robes, are handsome.\nBut the performers -- who also include Hiroshi Jin in the title role, and Sho Tohno as Jason, Yuji Koide as Nurse and Chorus, and Chinatsu Shimoyama as Chorus -- looked as if they'd be even better in a better vehicle. Mr. Kenji's ''Medea'' is too much a thing of rolling, darting, wailing ghosts.\nMr. Jin has made a name for himself in Japan as an interpreter of female roles and an adapter and director of theater and film works. In addition to founding Company East, he formed a group called the J-Boys, described in the sketchy program notes as an ''all-male, ultra-extreme show team.'' But his Medea is relatively straightforward, a matter more of immersion in a character than self-conscious female impersonation.\nMr. Jin is most affecting in his rare moments of relative stillness, as when Medea contemplates the murder of her two young sons. But there is only one possible response -- a heartfelt ''huh?'' -- to the startlingly sudden intrusion of modern gender-identity questioning in the final moments of ''Medea.''\nCompany East performs ''Medea'' through Jan. 14 at La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710 or lamama.org.\nDANCE REVIEW

Jones, David Parsons, Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker among them -- their first opportunity to try their craft onstage.\nThe latest edition opened on Thursday night, featuring six choreographers chosen from the 120 applicants who turned up at the open audition. All are women, and all used electronic scores that provided sonic ambience rather than rhythmic impetus, but there were few other common denominators in a program of uneven work.\nHeather McArdle's ''Whitelife Blackhole'' provided a compelling theatrical experience through the physical intensity of Ms. McArdle, a white-clad fragile figure with a mop of tousled red hair and remarkable coordination.\nThe piece began as she typed ''Are your thoughts crippling you? I feel like a robot most days'' on an all-white computer at an all-white desk, and her subsequent fluid falls to the floor and abrupt recoveries, endlessly circling legs and folding arms, effectively suggested both an encroaching madness and a desperate struggle against it.\nAnother solo, ''Sternum,'' choreographed and performed by Tara O'Con, showed impressive bodily control in near-imperceptible shifts of position but looked more like a promising sketch than a developed work.\nDeganit Shemy's descriptively named ''Queentet'' offered five women in short skirts and blouses who could have been pupils at a particularly upmarket private school. One stood, passive and catatonic, throughout the piece, as the others alternately tormented and ignored her, moving in awkward, jerky bursts with knock knees, fussy gestures and dragging feet, while occasionally emitting little shrieks.\nMs. Shemy's deliberately repetitive vocabulary and affectless tone go on a little too long, but her counterpointed duos and trios are skillfully made, drawing the eye to the details of the movement.\nAnother ensemble piece, Lala Ghahreman's ''mourning glory,'' was less successful in its use of two women and three men in a series of disconnected episodes that involved inflatable rings and the singing of ''Over the Rainbow.''\nUrsula Eagly's ''Garden of Earthly Delights'' was an even more impenetrable duo for a blood-spattered, hand-clasping pair who snorted, sang and shuffled about. The audience seemed to like it.\n''Fresh Tracks'' will be performed again tonight at Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 691-6500 or dtw.org.\nDANCE REVIEW

1816655	At Armenian Churches, a Distinct Observance Today	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E0D91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Today the Armenian Church, one of the most ancient branches of Christianity, celebrates the birth of Jesus. One wonders, admittedly a bit fancifully, if there is a lesson in the Armenian practice for the many Christians who desperately wish that the religious meaning of Jesus' birth could be rescued from angry culture wars and commercial frenzy.\nFor the Armenian Church, today's holy day is the Feast of the Theophany. Other Christians will also be celebrating Theophany as a major religious feast today or, in some of the Western churches, where the day is commonly known as Epiphany, tomorrow. But over the centuries the focus of the day has come to differ within the different strands of Christianity.\nWhat is common to all of them in its celebration is captured in the derivation of the feast's name from Greek, combining ''theos,'' or ''god,'' with ''phainein,'' meaning ''to show forth.'' Thus ''Theophany'' means ''divine manifestation.'' (''Epiphany'' is simply ''manifestation.'')\nIn the East, the Orthodox churches, which do not include the Armenian, place their focus on the manifestation of Jesus as God's son when, as related in three of the four Gospels, he was baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. In the West, the focus has come to be the manifestation of Jesus to the Gentiles symbolized by the visit of the gift-bearing Magi.\nIn the early centuries of Christianity, the many manifestations of Jesus -- from the Annunciation to Mary right through his first miracle, at the wedding feast in Cana, and of course including his birth -- were celebrated together, at least in some parts of the East, and especially on Jan. 6. In the absence of any scriptural basis for precisely dating these events, that day emerged for symbolic reasons, probably related to the Egyptian calendar that placed the winter solstice at this time.\nIn the fourth century, however, the birth of Jesus was increasingly celebrated separately on Dec. 25, first in Rome and later in the East. Again, most scholars attribute this to a Christian effort either to appropriate or to supplant the religious themes of the imperial Roman cult of the sun, which was in turn related to the dating of the solstice by the Roman, or Julian, calendar.\nOnly the Armenians, who were not part of the Roman Empire and therefore not faced with a competing imperial cult, never accepted Dec. 25 or in fact any separate date for celebrating Jesus' birth.\nInstead, the Armenian Church maintained in the one Feast of Theophany the linkage of Jesus' birth, which will be emphasized in today's services, and his baptism, to be emphasized tomorrow, when a cross will be immersed in water. Indeed, the liturgy retains echoes of the whole series of ''theophanies,'' or divine manifestations.\n(Warning: The story of dates for celebrating Jesus' birth is further confused by the fact that some parts of Eastern Orthodox Christianity still follow the Julian calendar in their church life rather than the 16th-century reformed Gregorian calendar. By the Julian calendar, Dec. 25 falls on the modern calendar's Jan. 7 and its eve on Jan. 6, while Theophany comes 12 days later, on the modern Jan. 19. In any event, these Orthodox churches celebrate the two feasts, marking birth and baptism, on separate days.)\nDo Armenian Christians in the United States celebrate the Dec. 25 holiday with gifts, Christmas trees and all the rest? Yes, they do, especially those here for generations, said the Very Rev. Vahan Hovhanessian, pastor of Holy Martyrs Armenian Church in Bayside, Queens, although there is also a custom, carried over from the Middle East, of exchanging gifts on New Year's Eve.\nBut Armenians maintain a clear mental distinction between the American culture's Christmas, Father Vahan said, and the Armenian Church's religious celebration of Christ's birth on Theophany. Armenians churches will be packed today, he said; people will be lined up on the sidewalk outside Holy Martyrs.\nOther Christian leaders may observe this distinction with a degree of envy. Many say that they feel trapped and wearied not only by the commercialization of Christmas but also by the culture warriors who are eager to embrace that commercialization in a strangely conceived campaign to keep the culture Christian or, as Stephen Colbert might say, ''Christianish.''\n''Instead of putting the Christ back in Christmas, maybe we should just take him out,'' the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author, wrote in The Philadelphia Inquirer before Christmas. ''In the battle between the Christians and the marketers,'' he wrote, ''the marketers have won -- decisively.''\nFather Martin's ''modest proposal'' was to ''give Christmas to the corporations'' and find a new date for a ''New Christmas'' -- ''a nice, quiet, shopping-free, religiously grounded holiday.'' His suggestion? ''Around, say, June,'' when Flag Day would be its only serious competition.\nBut maybe the Armenian celebration of Theophany is more promising. Tied as the feast is to the whole panoply of what Christians hold as divine manifestations, it might prove easier to keep the ''theos'' in Theophany than to keep Christ in Christmas.\nNot that anyone should ever underestimate the power of the marketers. How long would it be, after all, before advertisements began appearing on Jan. 7: ''Only 364 shopping days till Theophany''?\nBELIEFS

A bronze statue of David Brower, a conservationist who was the first executive director of the Sierra Club, had stood atop the 15-foot globe and is now partly crushed. A steel time capsule intended to be opened in 3006 is exposed amid the rubble.\nEino flew to the site from his home in Pahrump, Nev., the day after the collapse and said he saw ''very clear evidence'' of vandalism. Steel beams that held together parts of the globe's seven layers of stone had been bent, he said, adding that the adhesive used is the same as that used by most large-scale sculptors, although he would not name the manufacturer.\n''The craftsmanship wasn't the cause,'' said Eino, whose Web site called ''Spaceship Earth'' his ''most ambitious project yet.'' One of his sculptures is in the Library of Congress; another adorned a venue for the Athens Olympics in 2004.\nBut a university spokeswoman, Arlethia Perry-Johnson, said yesterday that the Cobb County police have said they do not think vandalism caused the collapse.\n''The first phase was to identify if there were any signs of criminal activity, and we have completed that process,'' Ms. Perry-Johnson said. ''The next phase of emphasis will focus on the potential structural causes.''\nThe sculpture was commissioned by Brian Maxwell, who created the PowerBar energy snack and donated it to Kennesaw.\n''When I first heard about it and saw it, I was in disbelief,'' said Birgit Wassmuth, chairwoman of the department of communication whose office in the new building will overlook the sculpture site. ''I've never seen a sculpture disintegrate like that. When you see the pattern how it fell apart, it was just like magic, it just disintegrated.''\nEino said he had plans to return to the campus to rebuild his work and ideas about how to make it stronger.\nBut some see the destruction as symbolic of the need to care for the fragile earth.\nProfessor Wassmuth, in fact, said it might be interesting to leave the sculpture as it is as a reminder ''that if we don't take care of this planet soon, it's going to fall apart, just like this.''
1816657	Harry Falk, 66, Chief of New York Board of Trade, Dies	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907EFD91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	C. Harry Falk, the chief executive and president of the New York Board of Trade, died Wednesday. He was 66 and lived in Rockland County in New York.\nThe exchange announced his death but did not disclose a cause.\nMr. Falk was named chief executive and president of the exchange in 2003. He had been associated with the Board of Trade and its predecessor organizations since 1970. He became the chairman of the exchange's board in 2000 and helped guide it after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nWhen the World Trade Center was bombed in 1993, the exchange was at 4 World Trade Center and it was forced to close for two weeks. After the bombing, the exchange began looking for a backup site and, in 1996, it secured space in Long Island City, Queens, at a cost of $300,000 a year.\nSome questioned the expense. But after the 2001 attacks destroyed the exchange's offices, still at 4 World Trade Center, its traders shifted to the backup operation. It was the only financial exchange to lose its trading floor in the attacks, but because of the backup site, it was the first to reopen.\nMr. Falk was long associated with sugar, one of the many commodities that are traded on the exchange, which opened in 1870 as the New York Cotton Exchange. It is a floor-based exchange with open-outcry trading.\nMr. Falk grew up in Middle Village, Queens. In 1958, while still a teenager, he began working as a clerk for Czarnikow-Rionda, a sugar broker. The company's Cuban assets were nationalized after Fidel Castro took power the next year, so it began to trade sugar from other Caribbean islands. Mr. Falk rose to become a partner in the firm.\nIn 1982, he moved to Richco Sugar, and two years later to the Louis Dreyfus Corporation.\nMr. Falk became a member of the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in 1970 and later became its chairman. During his tenure, in 1997, the exchange began a process that led to its merger in 2004 with the New York Cotton Exchange to form the New York Board of Trade. It trades commodities like cotton, ethanol, orange juice and sugar, as well as currency, index futures and options.\nAt the time of the merger, Mr. Falk said, ''While it is somewhat sad to see both the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange disappear and become simply a part of our history, we must move forward and embrace change in a manner which contributes to the vitality and expansion of our markets.''\nLast September, Mr. Falk helped engineer the merger of the New York Board of Trade and the all-electronic International Continental Exchange, a deal valued at $1 billion. The merger preserved the open-outcry trading, but it also brought electronic trading to the exchange.\nHe is survived by his wife, Joan; 5 children; and 12 grandchildren.
1816658	Bernard Meltzer, 92, Labor Expert and Nuremberg Prosecutor	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06EFD91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Bernard D. Meltzer, a law professor who helped bring clarity to labor-management issues at a time of great change in the field, who was a prosecutor at the Nuremberg war crimes trials and who helped draft the United Nations Charter, died Thursday at his home in Chicago. He was 92.\nThe cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Jean Sulzberger Meltzer.\nMr. Meltzer was the Edward H. Levi distinguished service professor emeritus at the University of Chicago School of Law, where he taught from 1946 until 1985.\nSoon after joining the faculty, he delved into controversial and complicated labor-law issues that, for the most part, had been set aside during World War II. They included interpretations of the Norris-La Guardia Act of 1932, which sharply restricted injunctions against striking unions, and of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which created a statutory framework for collective bargaining.\n''It was not that Bernie came up with grand conclusions,'' said Richard A. Epstein, a colleague at the University of Chicago who has also written extensively on labor law. ''He was a terrific technical lawyer who smoothed the awkward edges of very complicated statutory schemes.''\nMr. Meltzer's writings dealt with a wide variety of labor issues. These included whether federal statutes pre-empt state labor laws, and the legality of secondary boycotts, those in which a union takes action against companies doing business with the company that the union is seeking to organize. His articles were often cited in modern works and current cases, Professor Epstein said.\nIn his later years, Mr. Meltzer continued to write, while sometimes also serving as a special master in labor disputes, a consultant to the Department of Labor and a salary arbitrator for major league baseball.\nBernard David Meltzer was born in Philadelphia on Nov. 21, 1914, one of six children of Julius and Rose Wolkov Meltzer, both immigrants from Russia. His father was a shoe salesman.\nIn addition to his wife of 60 years, he is survived by a son, Daniel, of Cambridge, Mass.; two daughters, Joan FitzGibbon of Indianapolis and Susan Yost of Columbus, Ohio; and six grandchildren.\nMr. Meltzer earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Chicago in 1935 and his law degree there two years later, graduating first in his class. In 1938, he received a master's of law degree from Harvard University.\nAfter working at a Chicago law firm, Mr. Meltzer went to Washington as an aide to Dean Acheson, who was then an assistant secretary of state. In 1943, Mr. Meltzer joined the Navy and was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency. In the closing days of the war, at the request of the State Department, he was reassigned to go to San Francisco to assist in drafting the United Nations Charter. He dealt in particular with the provisions establishing the General Assembly.\nIn 1946, while still in the Navy, Mr. Meltzer was assigned to the United States prosecution staff for the Nuremberg war crime trials.\nHe led a team of lawyers who gathered evidence against business executives who had helped finance the Nazi war machine and against defendants accused of plundering occupied territories and profiting from the use of millions of slave laborers. He also conducted the pretrial interrogation of Hermann Göring, Hitler's second in command, and presented the case against Walther Funk, the Third Reich's minister of economics.\nIn describing the methodical record-keeping that the Nazis employed for their system of death camps, Mr. Meltzer wrote in 1999, ''It was a lawyer's dream, but a humanist's nightmare.''
1816659	Jack Myers, 93, Editor Who Geared Science to Children	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01EFD91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Jack E. Myers, a molecular biologist who not only researched algae as a food source that could be grown in space but also made science comprehensible to youngsters as an editor of Highlights for Children magazine, died Dec. 28 at his home in Austin, Tex. He was 93.\nThe cause was cancer, his nephew Fred Myers said.\nAn expert on photosynthesis, phototropism (the movement of plants toward or away from light) and particularly the physiology of algae, Professor Myers taught at the University of Texas from 1941 to 1980, but conducted research as an emeritus professor until 1999.\nIn 1998, Professor Myers won a Founders Award from the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology for his work on the potential of algae, essentially plants with no roots, stems or leaves, as food that could be grown on space vehicles.\nKenneth A. Souza, president of the society and a former NASA senior scientist, called Professor Myers ''one of the pioneers'' in using algae to convert ''the carbon dioxide that our space crews would exhale and, in the presence of light and water, create food and oxygen.''\nThat research grew out of a more down-to-earth problem. A 1953 article in The New York Times cited Professor Myers's work in producing a pound of Chlorella -- a species of algae -- in a water solution that filled just a quarter-inch space between two, three-foot glass tubes, one inserted inside the other.\nPointing out that algae was then being advocated as a part of the solution to world hunger, the article said, ''Theoretically, 55,000 pounds of protein can be harvested from a single acre of Chlorella -- more than 60 times the annual output of an acre of soybeans.''\nProfessor Myers wrote more than 100 papers for scientific journals. But he also wrote for children, including books like ''What Makes Popcorn Pop?'' (1991) and ''What Happened to the Mammoths?'' (2000), published by Boyds Mills Press, a family-owned company.\nFrom 1958 until his death, Professor Myers was the science editor of Highlights, a general interest magazine for children started by his parents, Garry and Caroline C. Myers, in 1946. The magazine has a circulation of about two million.\nOne of the problems Professor Myers faced as an editor was finding scientists whose writing would fascinate children. The hundreds of articles that he assigned touched on subjects like black holes and comets, frogs croaking to warn of predators and how the Maya and Aztecs made rubber balls.\nJack Edgar Myers was born on July 10, 1913, in Boyds Mills, Pa. He graduated from Juniata College in 1933, received a master's degree from Montana State University in 1935 and a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1939.\nProfessor Myers is survived by four daughters, Shirley Wendlandt, of Mullin, Tex.; Jacquelyn Leonard, of Lakeway, Tex.; Linda Anderson, of Ashland, Ore.; and Kathleen Holland, of Spicewood, Tex.; 10 grandchildren; and 7 great-grandchildren. His wife of 69 years, Evelyn De Turck Myers, died in 1997.\nPart of Professor Myers's job at Highlights was to answer as many as 400 letters a year from children asking questions like why human skin wrinkles in water and the difference between frogs and toads. Disparaging the teaching of science as a collection of data, he once said, ''When it becomes a bunch of facts, it is sterile and rather unexciting.''
1816660	A. Richard Newton, 55, Electronic Design Pioneer	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00EFD91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	A. Richard Newton, a pioneer in electronic design technology who directly influenced the industry as well as being a mentor to countless engineering students, died on Tuesday in San Francisco. He was 55.\nThe cause was pancreatic cancer, according to the University of California, Berkeley, where Professor Newton was dean of the engineering school.\n''Rich really played a key part in the semiconductor industry,'' said Paul Gray, his immediate predecessor as head of Berkeley's engineering school and now provost. ''It's unusual for an academic to have such strong ties to industry.''\nProfessor Newton's most notable engineering achievement was in electronic design automation, tools used to create electronic systems like those in semiconductor manufacturing.\nProfessor Newton, an Australian by birth, became interested in the field during his undergraduate days at the University of Melbourne, where he happened upon the work of Donald Pederson, a Berkeley engineering professor who was considered the father of electronic design automation.\nIn 1975, he went to the University of California, Berkeley, for graduate school and continued his work on circuit design automation. His research with Professor Pederson contributed to the founding of SDA Systems -- later Cadence Design Systems, one of Silicon Valley's most prominent technology companies -- as well as of Synopsys, another electronic systems software company.\nProfessor Newton was also founding director of the Gigascale Systems Research Center for design and testing, a joint project of the federal government and the semiconductor industry that coordinates university research.\nHe served as a director of Silicon Valley companies and as an adviser to several prominent venture capital funds that invest in technology.\nArthur Richard Newton was born in Melbourne in 1951.\nProfessor Gray said the young Mr. Newton's gifts were so evident as a graduate student that the university took the unusual step of giving him a teaching position in the engineering school directly after he received his Ph.D.\nHe became dean of the engineering school in 2000 and is credited with having doubled the number of women in the engineering faculty since then.\nProfessor Newton was widely known for working to apply engineering technology to challenging social problems, close to home in California as well as in developing countries.\nIn 2001, he led the establishment of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society, known as Citris, an effort with other California universities to apply engineering technology to global challenges like poverty, health care and environmental problems.\nMost recently, Professor Newton championed the study of synthetic biology, a field that applies engineering principles to the life sciences.\nHe is survived by his wife, Petra, and two daughters, Neris and Amrita.
1816661	Editor's E-Mail May Be Used In Suit Against The Times	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05EED91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	A lawyer for a former government scientist who is suing The New York Times for defamation over a series of columns about the deadly anthrax mailings of 2001 said Friday in court that he was prepared to introduce an internal e-mail message from a senior Times editor that raised questions about one of the columns.\nThe lawyer, Mark A. Grannis, said the columns written by Nicholas D. Kristof about the federal investigation of the mailings unfairly damaged the reputation of his client, Dr. Stephen A. Hatfill, a former germ warfare scientist.\nDr. Hatfill's lawyers have said the columns wrongfully suggested that he was responsible for the attacks.\nMr. Grannis told Judge Claude M. Hilton of Federal District Court here that if the trial proceeded he would introduce evidence including a May 23, 2002, message from Philip Taubman, then deputy editor of the editorial page, raising questions about a draft of a column by Mr. Kristof.\nBeginning that spring, Mr. Kristof wrote a series of columns about a government scientist whom he initially referred to as Mr. Z., saying the scientist had become the overwhelming focus of the investigation. That August, Mr. Kristof wrote that Dr. Hatfill had acknowledged that he was Mr. Z. at a news conference in which he said the news media had mistreated him.\nMr. Grannis said he would introduce evidence of questions about the column posed by Mr. Taubman and others. The evidence from Mr. Taubman, the lawyer said, was a message saying the as-yet-unpublished column ''pointed pretty much at the guy'' and encouraging Mr. Kristof to take out some of the material that did that.\nMr. Grannis made his disclosure of the information that he has obtained in the discovery phase of the suit in a hearing on a Times motion to seek dismissal of the complaint.\nThe trial is scheduled to start Jan. 29. Judge Hilton did not say when he would rule.\nThe Times has argued that the columns were aimed at prodding the Federal Bureau of Investigation to pursue the anthrax case more vigorously and did not accuse Dr. Hatfill of being the person responsible for the mailings.\nIn writing about the investigation, Mr. Kristof's ire was directed against federal officials for not moving swiftly to decide whether the scientist was guilty or innocent, the paper's lawyers have said.\n''His intent was to focus on the F.B.I.,'' a lawyer for The Times, Lee Levine, told Judge Hilton.\nMr. Levine, of Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz, told Judge Hilton that Mr. Hatfill was a public figure, or as someone recognized in libel and defamation law as a limited-purpose public figure, because of his involvement in the public debate about preparedness for a bioterrorist attack.\nMr. Levine said Dr. Hatfill had ''voluntarily thrust himself into the vortex of that controversy'' through his writings and speeches, confirmed by Dr. Hatfill's complaints that he was easily identified as Mr. Z by many people in the field.\nAs a public figure Dr. Hatfill would have a far greater burden in his effort to win a defamation suit. To prevail, a public figure has to prove that the material was published with ''actual malice,'' that is with the knowledge that the statements were false or with reckless disregard as to whether they were false.\nLawyers for The Times also argued that neither Mr. Taubman's message nor any other evidence put forward by Mr. Hatfill's lawyers was proof that Mr. Kristof had acted with reckless disregard for the truth, the standard that Mr. Hatfill must meet if he is found to be a public figure.\nThe Times said that even if all of Mr. Hatfill's assertions were true, he would not prevail and that therefore the judge should dismiss the case before trial. The message from Mr. Taubman, now Washington bureau chief for The Times, was released Friday afternoon by the lawyers for The Times. It read: ''Nick, you're still pointing pretty much at the guy. I think you need to lose the material I've marked in boldface.''\nMr. Taubman had marked two paragraphs referring to a middle-age American scientist with experience in producing bioweapons. The column, which appeared May 24, included the first of those two paragraphs but dropped the second, the messages showed. Although the essence of that message was pretty much as Mr. Grannis represented it in court, two other e-mail messages he cited were more ambiguous.\nHe said messages from Nicholas Wade, a former science editor at the paper and then a special projects writer, and Gail Collins, the editorial page editor, were critical of a column prepared for publication in July. Those messages, as disclosed by lawyers for The Times, raised more generalized suggestions.\nMr. Grannis said Mr. Wade's message had said the column made it plausible to a reader that Mr. Kristof was pointing at Mr. Z as the culprit.

1816662	6 Ohio Cities Rush to File Suits Against Makers of Lead Paint	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804EED91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Racing against a proposed state law that would limit paint manufacturers' liability for lead poisoning in aging neighborhoods, Cincinnati has joined five other Ohio cities in filing suits that seek millions of dollars from the companies to clean up lead paint.\nOhio is the latest front in a battle that pits paint companies against cities and states struggling to overcome problems associated with lead poisoning.\nThe problems include learning impairment in children, high blood pressure in adults and, at high levels of exposure, seizures, comas and deaths.\nMunicipal and county governments in California, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey and Texas have also sued major manufacturers seeking what would amount to billions of dollars in damages.\nWhether responsibility rests primarily with paint companies, landlords who let paint deteriorate or cities that fail to enforce housing codes remains an open question.\nRhode Island broke new ground in February by winning a jury trial that found that three paint companies had created a public nuisance and had to clean up lead-paint contamination throughout the state at an estimated cost of $1.37 billion to $3.74 billion.\nThe companies are seeking a new trial there and trying to fend off litigation throughout the country. They are Sherwin-Williams, based in Cleveland; NL Industries, part of Valhi of Dallas and whose predecessor National Lead made Dutch Boy paint; and Millennium Holdings of Hunt Valley, Md., a successor to a company that owned Glidden Paint, originally based in Cleveland.\n''The movement is gaining steam,'' Jack McConnell, the lead lawyer in the Ohio lawsuits and a participant in the Rhode Island trial, said. ''We've seen it both in the Rhode Island trial and in three or four appellate court decisions, all of which have ruled against the lead-paint industry.''\nLawyers for paint companies say such suits unjustifiably shift responsibility from the cities that failed to enforce housing codes that would have kept lead paint from deteriorating and affecting residents.\n''Did the companies know that lead was toxic?'' asked Bonnie Campbell, who represents several paint manufacturers. ''Sure, everybody knew that. What wasn't known was that property owners wouldn't take care of their property.''\nMs. Campbell noted that most manufacturers voluntarily began removing lead from their products in 1955, when problems became apparent.\nIn Ohio, Gov. Bob Taft decided on Friday to allow a bill to become law without his signature that will ban future suits like those filed by the cities that are based on public nuisance grounds. Plaintiffs will instead have to rely on product liability law, which requires proof linking lead paint in a given home to a specific manufacturer. Noneconomic damages, including punitive damages, will be capped at $5,000 a consumer, instead of being unlimited.\nMr. Taft said that provision prevented him from signing the bill because the cap was too low.
1816663	Justices to Consider Impact of Mental Illness on Death Penalty	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EED91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to use the case of a schizophrenic death row inmate in Texas to set the standard for determining when a mental illness is so severe that execution would be constitutionally impermissible.\nThe question is not a new one for the court or for the criminal justice system, but it has come to the fore recently as a growing number of legal and mental health organizations have joined a call for a moratorium on executing those whose rational judgment has been significantly impaired, including their ability to appreciate why they have been sentenced to death.\nThe American Psychiatric Association has expressed specific concern about the competency standard used by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which upheld the death sentence for the Texas inmate, Scott L. Panetti, in rejecting his petition for a writ of habeas corpus last May.\nMr. Panetti, convicted in 1992 of fatally shooting his in-laws in the presence of his estranged wife and their 3-year-old child, is a 48-year-old Navy veteran who was hospitalized 14 times for schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders in the decade before the crime. A jury nonetheless found him competent to stand trial, and the judge permitted him to represent himself.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment barred the execution of the mentally ill. But the justices who decided that case, Ford v. Wainwright, did not settle on a definition of mental illness for the purpose of determining competency for execution.\nMost lower courts have adopted, as controlling, a separate opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., who said that the ''retributive goal of the criminal law'' was satisfied as long as defendants were aware of ''the punishment they are about to suffer'' and ''why they are to suffer it.''\nThe Fifth Circuit, which supervises the courts in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, has boiled this down to what it calls an ''awareness'' test. In Mr. Panetti's case, Panetti v. Quarterman, No. 06-6407, the appeals court found the test was satisfied because Mr. Panetti indicated that he understood the state's intention to execute him for killing his wife's parents. The fact that he also held the delusional belief that his execution was part of a conspiracy by which the state was trying to prevent him from preaching the Gospel was beside the point, the appeals court said.\nIn Mr. Panetti's appeal to the Supreme Court, his lawyers argue that the appeals court has distorted Justice Powell's meaning by failing to take the delusions into account. ''The moral force of retribution is lost if an inmate believes that his execution is being carried out through a conspiracy of demonic forces rather than as a lawful punishment for a horrific crime,'' their brief argues.\nIn a brief urging the justices to accept the appeal, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an advocacy organization, said ''this case exemplifies why mere 'awareness,' the test applied by the Fifth Circuit, is not a meaningful requirement for determining whether to execute prisoners who are severely mentally ill.''\nThe brief said the test ''makes no sense when applied to a prisoner who is plagued by delusions of grand persecution.''\nAt his trial, Mr. Panetti was often incoherent and tried to issue subpoenas to Jesus, the pope and John F. Kennedy.\nThe justices' decision to hear his appeal was the latest indication of the Supreme Court's concern about the administration of capital punishment. In recent years, the court has declared unconstitutional the execution of mentally retarded defendants as well as those who committed murder before the age of 18. Some opponents of the death penalty have described mental illness as the next frontier in the debate.\nMr. Panetti's case was one of seven new appeals the court granted on a busy day as the justices returned from a four-week recess. The cases will be heard on dates yet to be determined in March and April.\nAmong the other new cases were appeals by the Bush administration and the National Association of Home Builders in a case that lies at the intersection between the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. The question is whether the Endangered Species Act limits the government's discretion to transfer certain authority over pollution permits from federal agencies to the individual states, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found.\nThe twin appeals, consolidated for a single argument, are National Association of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, No. 06-340, and United States Environmental Protection Agency v. Defenders of Wildlife, No. 05-549.\nWith two significant environmental cases already having been argued in the last three months, the term figures to be one of the most consequential in years for environmental law.
1816664	China Media Battle Hints at Shift on Intellectual Property	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501EED91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	One of China's largest newspapers has filed a lawsuit against one of the country's leading Internet portals claiming that it violated copyright laws, setting off a media war and highlighting the first signs of a possible shift in policies toward intellectual property rights here.\nIn the suit, which was filed in October and is expected to go to court soon, the newspaper, The Beijing News, is seeking $400,000 in damages from a popular Internet site called Tom.com, alleging that it has copied and republished more than 25,000 articles and photos without authorization since 2003.\nChina has long had the reputation as a sort of no man's land for intellectual property rights, with companies in virtually every industry freely copying designs and other content from foreign companies and domestic rivals with little fear of punishment.\nThe lawsuit, however, is headed to court at a time of accelerating legal change and signs of increased efforts by law enforcement to protect copyrights and intellectual property. It is also a critical time for China's newspaper industry, which grew explosively in the last decade or so but now faces an even faster-growing rival: Internet-based news media.\nNow, as in the United States and many other countries, with computer use and broadband access booming here, newspapers are losing readers to large, corporate-owned Web sites. What had set China apart from much of the rest of the world until recently was that these Web sites faced no legal obstacles in copying material from newspapers, often wholesale.\n''There is a very brutal competition between newspapers -- with seven or eight big ones just in Beijing -- and now a big, new player, the Internet, wants to wipe them all out, to change the landscape,'' said Yu Guofu, a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property. ''The press is leading a hard life and facing an unpleasant future, but it has decided it is better to protect its rights than just sit and wait to die.''\nAccording to one recent study, newspaper readership in China has declined sharply in the last three years, with the number of people who say they read a newspaper at least once a week falling to 22 percent last year from 26 percent in 2003.\nA major presumed cause for the decline is that big Internet content providers, or portals, have become one-stop sources for all manner of information, including news, entertainment and blogs.\nUntil recently, the general practice for most portals was to lift news and other information directly from other sources, sometimes crediting the original source and sometimes not, but rarely paying for the information.\nThe Beijing News lawsuit was filed a little more than a year after a meeting of major newspaper publishers in Nanjing at which strategies were discussed to shore up the industry's base and combat the leeching of content and readers by Internet companies.\n''In terms of the law, things are quite clear, that Tom's use of Beijing News's work without authorization clearly violates Beijing News's copyrights,'' said Yu Guoming, dean of the school of journalism at Renmin University in Beijing. ''There are lots and lots of cases very similar to this one, but with this lawsuit, the traditional media is sending a very clear signal to the electronic media that their free lunch is over.''\nA spokesman for Tom.com, Tu Jianglu, denied any violations. ''As a big company we respect copyright and property rights,'' he said. ''I can only say that there are other facts that make this more complicated.''\nThe Beijing News declined to comment on the lawsuit.\nUntil recently, China's laws have generally been anything but clear on intellectual property, and have made it difficult to win a suit over an alleged infringement. Such an environment may have served China's needs earlier in its industrial takeoff, when its industries were straining to catch up with the West.\nThe battle in the news media reflects part of a shift in the intellectual property landscape as China's growing place in world trade has brought strong new pressures to rein in wholesale piracy. Many of the country's largest Internet companies, for example, are listed on foreign stock exchanges, making them liable for lawsuits filed abroad.\nZhang Xin, a spokesman for Sohu.com, a leading portal, said, ''We've signed agreements with over 1,000 traditional news organizations in China, which means that if we use their articles or reports, we definitely have reached prior agreement with them.''\nAn awareness also seems to be taking hold here that Chinese companies must build strong brands of their own to succeed and that they cannot do so in an environment where copying goes unpunished.\n''To enhance the country's development we are trying to encourage innovation,'' said Xu Chao, vice director of the National Copyright Bureau, a government agency. ''We are placing more emphasis on intellectual property, and have made improvements in the law. It used to be possible for traditional media or Internet media to simply copy each other's work, but now this has been forbidden.''
1816665	Ties to Communist Secret Police Snare Polish Bishop	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00EED91430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Warsaw's new archbishop, Stanislaw W. Wielgus, caught in Eastern Europe's widening witch hunt for former Communist secret police informers, admitted Friday that he had collaborated with the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, known as the S.B.\n''Before you today, I confess to the mistake committed by me years ago, just as I have confessed to the Holy Father,'' Bishop Wielgus said in an open letter to Polish Catholics. ''By the fact of this entanglement, I have damaged the church.''\nHe said he compounded that damage by denying ''facts of this cooperation'' in recent days.\nBishop Wielgus insisted, however, that he had neither spied on anyone nor harmed anyone. He said the only thing he ever did was to inform the secret police of his agenda during foreign academic meetings and to promise not to take part in anti-Communist activities.\nHe said it was up to Pope Benedict XVI to decide whether he would keep his new job, which he took up Friday.\nThe bishop is to be officially elevated to archbishop during a ceremony on Sunday in Warsaw at St. John's Cathedral, though many voices in Poland have called for him to step down.\nThe Warsaw archbishopric is a particularly symbolic institution in the former Soviet bloc. The Polish church, together with the Polish-born Pope John Paul II, were crucial supporters of the pro-democracy Solidarity movement, which helped bring down the totalitarian system and end the cold war.\nConfirmation that the archbishop collaborated is doubly troubling because the Polish secret police murdered a charismatic anti-Communist priest from the archdiocese, the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, in 1984. Warsaw's departing archbishop, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, waged a quiet battle with the Communist Party in those years.\nMany historians argue that a significant segment of the clergy in Poland and other Eastern bloc countries collaborated to varying degrees with the secret services. Priests have recently been added to those segments of society under scrutiny in several countries during recent efforts to expose former Communist collaborators.\nTwo years ago, files surfaced showing that the Rev. Mieczyslaw Malinski, who had been close to John Paul II, worked for the S.B. in the 1980s. Several other prominent priests have since been accused of having been informers, and some have admitted that they had links to the secret police. The Polish church publicly apologized last year for priests who collaborated with the S.B., but has tried to keep their names secret.\nThe uproar over Bishop Wielgus's past began shortly after Pope Benedict picked him in early December to succeed Cardinal Glemp as Warsaw's archbishop. A Polish daily newspaper, Gazeta Polska, reported Dec. 20 that the bishop, 67, had spied on dissidents and fellow clerics for more than two decades, until Communism collapsed in 1989.\nBoth Bishop Wielgus and the Vatican sought to deflect the accusations by saying his involvement with the secret police had been nothing out of the ordinary for people traveling abroad during the Communist era. Leading representatives of the Polish clergy denounced the accusations against him.\nBut Poland's human rights ombudsman, Janusz Kochanowski, said Thursday that there was evidence in the secret police archives that Bishop Wielgus had knowingly cooperated with Communist authorities. Rzeczpospolita, one of Poland's most respected newspapers, published documents showing that he had met with police agents more than 50 times in one five-year period.\nEven Poland's Catholic Church Historical Commission issued a statement on Friday, saying, ''There are numerous, substantial documents confirming Stanislaw Wielgus's willingness for a conscious and secret cooperation with the Communist security forces.''\nThe commission said that there was no evidence that Bishop Wielgus's actions harmed anyone, and that the documents would be sent to the Vatican for further study.\nMonsignor Wielgus first admitted Friday that he had signed a cooperation statement with the secret police in 1978 under pressure by a ''brutal intelligence officer'' when he was seeking permission to travel to Munich. ''That was my moment of weakness,'' he wrote.\nBut he accused the secret police of falsifying documents that cast him as a more eager, useful collaborator than he actually was.\n''The personality ascribed to me in the intelligence service documents is so far from the truth that I would never have recognized myself,'' he wrote.\nThose claims are not far-fetched. Almost from the moment the Iron Curtain fell, the nations of the former Communist bloc have been steeped in controversies over the files of their secret police forces. The documents are often elliptical and incomplete, and were sometimes embellished by secret police officers eager to impress their superiors, experts say.\nThe documents published by Rzeczpospolita and other newspapers suggest that Bishop Wielgus was recruited by the S.B. in 1967 when he was a philosophy student at the University of Lublin in eastern Poland, more than a decade before he signed the cooperation agreement. Newspapers cited other documents in which the S.B. claimed he had given them information about activities at the university, where he later served as a professor of medieval philosophy.\nThe newspapers claimed that some documents referred to Bishop Wielgus by the code names Grey, Adam and Adam Wysocki. They said he received training and was rewarded for his collaboration with a grant to study in Munich.\nLater Friday, Bishop Wielgus issued another statement, which was broadcast by Vatican Radio's Polish service, in which he said he had collaborated so that he could travel abroad for his academic research.\n''I'm not trying to justify anything, I know that I shouldn't have had any relations with the Communist regime's secret services,'' he said. ''At the time I thought I had to continue my important scientific research and acquire sound training for the good of the church.''\nThe Vatican has continued to support the embattled prelate.\n''The Holy See, in deciding the nomination of the new archbishop of Warsaw, took into consideration all the circumstances of his life, including those regarding his past,'' the Vatican said in a statement on Friday, repeating the position it has taken for the past month.\nThe statement said Benedict ''has every confidence in Bishop Stanislaw Wielgus and in full conscience entrusted him the mission of pastor of the archdiocese of Warsaw.''

In a statement, he praised her ''outstanding management skills'' and said he intended to delegate to her ''much of the administrative and management work of the Secretariat.''\nOn Wednesday Mr. Ban, who took over as secretary general on Jan. 1, appointed Alicia Bárcena Ibarra, 54, a Mexican diplomat, to be the under secretary general for management, the top post focused exclusively on administration.\nWhile some United States officials were unenthusiastic about Ms. Bárcena because of her lack of experience in financial management, they praised the choice of Ms. Migiro.\n''Her experience indicates she will do a fantastic job,'' said Richard A. Grenell, the spokesman for the United States Mission. American officials said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was personally acquainted with Ms. Migiro and was pleased when she heard of the appointment on Friday.\nMs. Migiro has been Tanzania's foreign minister since January 2006, and before that she served for five years as minister for community development, gender and children. Over the past year she has played a leading role in efforts to resolve conflicts in central Africa.\nAs Mr. Ban started to build his team this week, African diplomats said they were pleased to hold on to one of the most influential posts after Kofi Annan, the former secretary general, who was from Ghana, stepped down.\n''Women are multitasking people,'' said Dumisani S. Kumalo, the South African ambassador, who is a major player on behalf of developing nations. ''And African women are even better. Watch out!''\nAfrican diplomats said Ms. Migiro had carried out a management overhaul in the foreign ministry, requiring new standards of efficiency.\nSome United Nations officials noted that Mr. Ban's choices signaled a step back from the corporate-style management reforms that Washington has pushed since the early 1990s. Neither Ms. Migiro nor Ms. Bárcena had substantial business experience. Mr. Ban made it clear that he would focus on diplomacy and did not intend to play the chief executive role, as some Americans had hoped.\nBut Ms. Migiro may help Mr. Ban to win new support for reform. ''The developing countries have seen the United States reforms as a way of taking control of the United Nations away from them,'' said Princeton N. Lyman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He said Ms. Migiro might be able to propose reforms ''in a way that does not seem threatening to them.''
1816667	A Status Quo Secretary General	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The big powers in the United Nations Security Council chose Ban Ki-moon as secretary general because they wanted a low-key bureaucrat who wouldn't rock the boat. Judging by Mr. Ban's early moves, the world has gotten exactly that.\nExpect no Kofi Annan-style exhortations to live up to the values of the U.N. charter. In commenting on the sordid execution of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Ban even managed to forget that the U.N. opposes the death penalty on principle. Expect no shift from patronage to selection based on merit for key staff positions. The top jobs in peacekeeping, political affairs and humanitarian relief are already being doled out to the favored candidates of London, Paris and Washington (three of Mr. Ban's backers).\nAnd expect no serious drive for much-needed administrative reform. The top management job, previously held by a reform-minded American, has now been given to a long-serving insider, Alicia Bárcena Ibarra of Mexico.\nMr. Ban takes over at a difficult time. The secretariat's reputation for integrity has been battered by the oil-for-food scandal, and the Security Council's claim to influence has been battered by its failure to halt the genocide in Darfur or the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea.\nOn one crucial front, though, the outlook may be brightening. Under President Bush, relations between Washington and the U.N. were driven to their lowest point ever, following the twin blows of the Iraq war and the destructive presence of the former ambassador, John Bolton. The White House reportedly plans to nominate a new ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, who actually believes in diplomacy.\nMr. Khalilzad is currently the ambassador in Baghdad, where he is one of the few American officials to try to reach out to Sunni Muslims and curb the divisively sectarian policies of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. Unfortunately, the White House -- desperate to make Mr. Maliki look like a leader -- decided it did not want such an activist ambassador. We hope that choosing Mr. Khalilzad for the United Nations is at least a sign that Mr. Bush is learning the importance of diplomacy and cooperation, if not the importance of a powerful U.N. leader or a strong-minded ambassador in Baghdad.\nEditorial

Like many decisions on the cutting edge of agricultural technology, it was hurried along in a way that is more sensitive to political and economic pressure than to the long-term welfare of animals, humans and the world they inhabit. Asking whether cloned meat and milk are safe is not even the right question. The right question is, why clone at all?\nApproving food from cloned animals will create another food-labeling nightmare and the same aggressive litigation that usually blocks any attempt to tell consumers where their food comes from.\nBut cloning has much worse consequences. It marks a revolutionary shift -- from the relative randomness of sexual reproduction to the apparent uniformity of asexual reproduction. Because cloning creates genetically identical animals, it will shrink the gene pool on which agriculture rests, and any drastic shrinkage in genetic diversity creates enormous health risks for a species.\nCloning isn't just a matter for the F.D.A. to decide. It is up to us as a society to decide as well. We should be asking much broader questions than the F.D.A. is able to. Who will cloning benefit? What will it do to the health of the animals themselves?\nBut the most important question of all may be this one: Are we willing to judge the suitability of new technologies in ways that fully address their ethical and biological complexities? Or are we doomed to give in to politics and the bottom line?\nEditorial

In fact, the Democrats owe their victory to the people's desire for a resolution of the conflict. Movie stars in the gallery, gala events, photo ops -- the Democrats should begin on a more serious tone, and be wary of crowing triumphalism.\nA little less show business, please. Work on the people's business.\nAlexander Goldstein Brooklyn, Jan. 5, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nRe ''Senate Feels Heat as House Cranks Up Ethics Overhaul'' (news article, Jan. 5):\nDemocrats are doing the right thing morally and politically in pushing for far-reaching ethics reform. In addition to being good for our Republic by returning at least some of the power back to the voters and away from special interests, reform will be good for the Democratic Party.\nIt takes courage to compete for the support of the voters on the merit of one's ideas and not by stacking the deck with incumbency. For candidates to resist a fair and open debate is to admit that their ideas can't stand up to public scrutiny on their own.\nRepublicans showed themselves unable or unwilling to compete based on ideas alone.\nWhile ethics reform will diminish the benefits of incumbency, and therefore put at risk the slim Democratic majority, recent history suggests that when playing on a level or semi-level playing field, Democratic ideas and priorities are supported by a majority of Americans.\nTal J. Zlotnitsky Trinity, Fla., Jan. 5, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nRe ''New Congress, Leftover Challenges'' (editorial, Jan. 4):\nYou say quite confidently that ''the voters are watching, and lawmakers dare not slip away from the promise to clean up their act.'' What is it that you think these lawmakers are trembling in fear of, when most House races are still not competitive because of gerrymandering?\nWhat we really need -- even more desperately than ethics reform -- is an independent, nonpartisan panel to draw legislative districts, so that every race is competitive in every election. Then and only then will the voters truly be able to hold their lawmakers accountable for their ethics.\nDaniel Dickinson Stanford, Calif., Jan. 4, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nIt is scandalous that the level of ethics in Congress has sunk so low that there is a need for you to call for the 110th Congress ''to clean up its own act.''\nIn opinion polls before the midterm elections last year, less than 40 percent of Americans gave Congress a high approval rating. But I don't think that those in Congress really care what the public thinks once they are elected.\nEven your well-intentioned call for change does not go nearly far enough. I do not understand why instead of calling for a complete elimination of earmarks, you would merely require the ''full disclosure'' of their authorship, since the authors would ''be mocked by taxpayers.''\nIt is disappointing that you do not even put forth a reason earmarks are essential. I suggest that history shows that there would be little taxpayer mocking (in any event, being mocked is a very small price to pay for the value the authors receive for inserting billions of dollars of earmarks).\nAll expenditures of taxpayer money should be debated and voted on, not inserted into mammoth spending bills without debate -- even if the author's name and photograph are attached.\nMorton M. Drosnes Barkhamsted, Conn., Jan. 4, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nThe Democrats' proposed ethics rules are a beginning, and following years of overbearing, high-rolling yet secretive Republican control, we voters do expect this Congress to work openly, and for us.\nCampaign contributions from lobbyists and corporations must be limited -- or, better, banned.

1816673	Scowcroft's Strategy For the Middle East	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E7D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	To the Editor:\nBrent Scowcroft (''Getting the Middle East Back on Our Side,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 4) asserts that ''a vigorously renewed effort to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict could fundamentally change both the dynamics in the region and the strategic calculus of key leaders.''\nYes, peace would be a blessing. It would realize Israel's yearning from its founding in 1948 for coexistence with its Arab neighbors. And it would give a new start to the Palestinian people, who for too long have been fed a misguided diet of all-or-nothing by their leaders.\nBut Mr. Scowcroft is wrong to believe that the conflict, even if it were ripe for resolution (a risky assumption given the current upper hand of Hamas, the internecine warfare between Hamas and Fatah, and the existential threats to Israel posed by a swaggering Iran and its regional proxies) would transform the region.\nAs the 2003 Arab Human Development Report noted, the region suffers from three foundational problems: a knowledge deficit, a gender deficit and a freedom deficit. In each of these areas, the report stressed, Arab nations lag far behind other countries.\nIt would be self-delusional to believe that the region's real challenges -- from corrupt, despotic regimes to fundamentalism; from the Shiite-Sunni split to human rights repression -- can be addressed by focusing on the Arab-Israeli conflict and not on these core issues.\nDavid A. Harris Executive Director American Jewish Committee New York, Jan. 4, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nBrent Scowcroft is right on target when he calls for ''a vigorously renewed effort to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.'' But his description of this effort doesn't mention two key groups: the two peoples and the Palestinian leadership.\nThe Joint Palestinian-Israeli Public Opinion Poll released on Dec. 25 finds a strong preference in both publics for the comprehensive settlement option, with 58 percent of the Israelis and 81 percent of the Palestinians supporting this track.\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas seeks to negotiate with Israel, but Hamas, which heads the Palestinian legislature and cabinet, refuses to recognize Israel or renounce terror.\nThe renewed effort must therefore begin with measures, led by the United States, to strengthen the Abbas faction at the expense of those opposed to negotiations for peace.\nThis would also counteract the expansion of Iran's influence into the Palestinian territories through Hamas described by Mr. Scowcroft.\nSeymour D. Reich David M. Elcott New York, Jan. 4, 2007\nThe writers are, respectively, president and executive director of the Israel Policy Forum.\nTo the Editor:\nBrent Scowcroft suggests that a vigorous push for peace between Israel and its neighbors will lay the groundwork for stabilizing Iraq and ending centuries-old blood feuds among the Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.\nA few short years ago, we were told that a newly democratic Iraq would allow peace and harmony to bloom across the Middle East.\nIt is time to recognize the simple truth that the Iraqi morass and the Arab-Israeli conflict are two unrelated problems, each requiring and meriting its own attention and its own solution.\nDaniel Wolf Teaneck, N.J., Jan. 4, 2007\nTo the Editor:\nBrent Scowcroft warns us as a nation that ''we cannot afford to fail that test'' of establishing a friendly government from the ashes of Saddam Hussein's authoritarian regime.\nI think that we already sat down for that test, without studying or bringing our trusty No. 2 pencils, and failed.\nWe can keep sitting at the desk staring at our blank test sheet, but maybe it would be better if we just switched majors. International studies does not seem to be our forte.\nDane M. Chetkovich Chicago, Jan. 5, 2007

While some first ladies have influenced our country, should we bestow this honor on people who are unelected, whose only credential is having a prominent spouse?\nFirst ladies too often serve as the face of America. I would much prefer that the coins represent individuals chosen by and responsible to their constituents.\nThere are countless hard-working senators, members of Congress, judges and other officials whom we have selected to make decisions and statements on our behalf. Women are increasingly entering these ranks of government.\nWouldn't honoring women who have served as governors, Supreme Court justices or legislators be a more fitting tribute to our country and to this nation's women than coins featuring ''First Spouses''?\nIrit R.

1816675	Day After Killings, a Hamas Leader Calls for a Truce	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E6D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, called Friday for an end to the internal violence in the Gaza Strip, a day after members of his own Hamas militia surrounded the house of a Fatah commander, killed him and his bodyguards and seriously wounded his wife and brother.\nBefore his death, the commander, Col. Muhammad Gharib, begged for help on a live telephone call to Palestinian television, saying his home near Jabaliya was being attacked by the Executive Force, a parallel security force under the command of the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, but that Fatah leaders and fighters did not respond.\n''They are killers,'' he said of the gunmen. ''They are targeting the house. Children are dying, they are bleeding. For God's sake, send an ambulance! We want an ambulance -- somebody move!''\nOn Friday, Fatah issued a statement suggesting another round of retaliation. ''All killers are legitimate targets,'' the statement said, adding, ''What is called the Executive Force is an enemy.''\nThe statement, confirmed by a Fatah official, Abdel-Hakim Awad, also said negotiations with Hamas on a unity government were impossible in the present atmosphere.\n''There will be no dialogue in the midst of this series of killings and organized terrorism practiced by Hamas,'' the statement said, calling on the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, to fire Interior Minister Said Siam and disband the Executive Force.\n''Said Siam is responsible for the execution and the cold-blooded murder to which our martyrs in Jabaliya were subjected,'' the statement said.\nMr. Abbas, who met with Mr. Haniya early Friday in an attempt to restore calm, tried to disband the Executive Force when it was established, but failed. Now it has about 6,000 men, including several hundred drawn from factions usually loyal to Mr. Abbas's Fatah movement.\nHamas officials said Colonel Gharib had been responsible for the deaths of two of their fighters.\nMr. Abbas has called for early parliamentary and presidential elections, a challenge to the Hamas government, which won parliamentary elections a year ago. Hamas has said it will not allow early elections, which it says are illegal, and has moved to enforce its hold over Gaza while calling for renewed talks on a unity government that Mr. Haniya would lead.\nThe new tensions have set off a series of battles between Hamas and Fatah forces that show no sign of ending, despite various efforts to restore calm.\nThere were emotional funerals on Friday for some of the dead from the attack on Thursday on Colonel Gharib's home. Two more people who had been wounded died Friday, bringing the total to eight. As a funeral cortege passed the colonel's blackened, shrapnel-riddled house, masked men fired guns into the air and shouted for revenge.\nIn Palestinian violence on Thursday, more than 60 people were wounded, including 10 children, Palestinian medics said. On Wednesday, five people died from violence.\nOn Friday a local cleric and frequent critic of Hamas, Adel Nasar, was murdered as he left his mosque, witnesses told The Associated Press.\nThere was no claim of responsibility in the death of Mr. Nasar, who was not openly affiliated with any political party, though he often spoke against Hamas in his sermons. In his sermon on Friday, Mr. Nasar warned that God would punish the killers of Colonel Gharib and his bodyguards, as well as the Palestinian rulers for not putting the rule of God into effect, witnesses said.\nSpeaking in another mosque on Friday, Mr. Haniya called for Palestinian guns to be aimed at Israelis, not other Palestinians. ''Our fight is not an internal one, it's against the occupation,'' he said. But it is increasingly clear that Mr. Haniya, although prime minister, does not have operational control over many of the Hamas gunmen, just as Mr. Abbas cannot control Fatah-affiliated militias.\nAs in Iraq, the division of power created by democratic elections, in the absence of a traditional powerful state or after the disappearance of one, has meant the continuation of party politics through armed militias affiliated with factions but not always controlled by them.\nIn the West Bank on Friday, Fatah supporters celebrated an anniversary by attending the weekly demonstration against Israel's separation barrier in the town of Bilin, where the barrier cuts off the village from much of its farmland.\nThe demonstrators are a mixture of Palestinians, Israelis and foreigners, and as usual, what was supposed to be a nonviolent protest turned into exchanges of rocks, rubber-coated bullets and tear gas with the Israeli Army and the border police.\nTen demonstrators were wounded, and two were hospitalized. Jibril Rajoub, a Fatah member and former security chief, said, ''Our battle with Hamas is not a battle of assassination, kidnapping or revenge.''\n''Our battle is with the occupation, not with each other,'' he added.\nAccording to Reuters, the Bush administration is asking Congress for $86 million in aid, not including weapons and ammunition, to bolster Mr. Abbas and his Presidential Guard. The aid, mostly training and supplies, according to an American document obtained by Reuters, is intended ''to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism and establish law and order in the West Bank and Gaza.'' Officials said previously that they expected to ask for nearly $100 million for the effort, which has itself been widely reported.\nIn Israel, there were recriminations over a failed army arrest raid in the center of the West Bank city of Ramallah on Thursday, hours before Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was to meet President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. The wanted man, though wounded, escaped, and four Palestinians were killed as Israeli forces exchanged fire with Palestinians in violent scenes that were televised live on Al Jazeera.\nMr. Olmert's aides said he had not been informed of the raid in advance and was angry about what had happened. The violence overshadowed the summit meeting, which Olmert aides said had gone well.\nBenjamin Ben-Eliezer, an Israeli cabinet member and former defense minister, criticized the timing of the raid. ''I don't think this operation should have been carried out on the day of a visit by the Israeli prime minister to a country in which we have a supreme strategic interest,'' he told Israel Radio. ''Our relations with Egypt are more important to us than anything else.''
1816676	American Diplomat to Visit Strife-Torn Somali Capital	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E6D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The State Department's top diplomat for Africa plans to visit Mogadishu, the violence-scarred Somali capital, on Sunday, American officials said Friday. It would be the first time in more than a decade that a high-ranking United States official has set foot there.\nBut Al Qaeda's second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahri, urged the world's Muslims on Friday to turn Somalia into a battlefield and use suicide attacks.\nThese developments were part of Somalia's transformation after Ethiopian-led forces ousted the once powerful Islamist movement from the capital last week and helped install a potentially viable government there for the first time in over 16 years.\nAmerican officials said the schedule for the diplomat, Jendayi E. Frazer, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, was still tentative, but that she planned to be in Mogadishu for four hours to meet with officials of the transitional government and leading Somali intellectuals.\nThe United States has had a minimal presence in the country since its diplomats were withdrawn in the fall of 1994, nearly a year after 18 Americans were killed during an ill-fated attempt to capture a warlord in Mogadishu. In his speech on Friday, Mr. Zawahri urged Muslim fighters to wage a holy guerrilla war in Somalia. ''I speak to you today as the crusader Ethiopian invasion forces violate the soil of the beloved Muslim Somalia,'' he said in an audio recording on a Web site that has featured Qaeda messages before. ''Launch ambushes, land mines, raids and suicidal attacks until you consume them as the lions eat their prey.''\nIt was not the first time that Muslim extremists have called for a holy war in Somalia.\nEthiopia has a long Christian history, and Somalia's Islamist leaders had been trying for months to rally outside support by portraying the Ethiopians as infidel invaders and urging Muslims worldwide to turn Somalia into the third front for jihad, after Iraq and Afghanistan.\nIn the end, though, Western intelligence officials said that only a few hundred foreign fighters heeded the call, and that they seemed to make little difference. The Islamist forces, made up of mostly untrained teenage troops, were routed by Ethiopian soldiers in one battle after another and lost in one week all the territory they had gained in the past six months.\nSomalia's transitional government is now in loose control of most of the country and Western diplomats, including Ms. Frazer, are urging African nations to quickly put together a peacekeeping force before Somalia reverts to anarchy.\nOfficials from Ethiopia, one of the poorest nations in the world, have said that they do not have the resources to keep soldiers here much longer. Ethiopia has justified its intervention by saying that Somalia's Islamists were a regional menace.\nMs. Frazer met Friday with Kenyan and Somali officials in Nairobi to discuss the details of the peacekeeping force. Uganda has already volunteered troops, and Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania have indicated they might also send forces.\nMs. Frazer was to travel to Yemen and Djibouti on Saturday to pursue the matter.\nIn Mogadishu, the transitional government was struggling to collect weapons. Earlier in the week, Ali Muhammad Gedi, the transitional prime minister, announced that Thursday was the deadline for all militias and gunmen to surrender their arms. Only a handful have complied and the deadline has been pushed back to Saturday.\nAs for the Islamists, Somali officials said Friday that the last remnants of their forces were cornered in a remote area of southern Somalia, south of Kismayo. Somali officials said they expected the conflict to end soon, though the Islamists have vowed to fight on as an underground insurgency.
1816677	Bridge Ad Deal Is Bargain For Geico, Some Experts Say	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE6D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Did Geico, the giant auto insurer, get too good of a deal from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey?\nThat is what some advertising executives are saying about the $1.6 million-a-year, two-year deal between the authority and Geico, which will soon have its name on billboards at the toll plaza for the George Washington Bridge. Geico's name will also adorn each tollbooth, signs on the approach road, and the Port Authority's Web site and direct mail.\nThe price tag, these executives say, is far too cheap, considering that 57 million eastbound drivers pass through the toll plaza in Fort Lee, N.J., each year. Though far different from ads on billboards, a 30-second television advertisement during the Super Bowl next month is estimated to cost an average of $2.6 million.\nEven by the Port Authority's standards, the deal with Geico may be low. The Port Authority collects $1.7 million a year from HSBC for ads the bank places in the walkways to planes at Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports -- locations with less historical stature than the George Washington Bridge.\n''To me, it sounds like a very, very big bargain,'' said Michael Watras, chief executive of Straightline International, a brand consultant. ''I just think the Port Authority was asleep at the wheel. They could have gotten five to six times as much.''\nGeico, meanwhile, may have gotten the better end of the deal, , Mr. Watras and others said. It spent more than $400 million on advertising across all media in 2005, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a research firm, so the deal with the Port Authority is less than half of one percent of its annual advertising budget. In the first nine months of 2006, Geico's spending on advertising rose 24 percent, according to TNS.\nGeico representatives did not return calls for comment. But Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said the deal with Geico is ''competitively priced'' because ''it's the first of its kind.'' Some advertising executives agreed, saying that it is hard to determine a fair price without having a benchmark.\nGeico was not the first company approached about buying ads; many companies were asked, including other auto insurers, but they declined. That could have forced the authority to reduce its price.\nThe price HSBC paid for the signs at La Guardia and Kennedy is also difficult to compare with the Geico deal because a greater number and variety of travelers at airports see those signs. Commuters on the George Washington Bridge are often the same people day after day.\nWhat's more, commuters, preservationists and residents near the bridge may become so irritated by the Geico signs that they take out their anger on the company.\n''It seems a bit low, but then again, you need to get an advertiser to take the risk of putting your name out there for the first time,'' said Allen P. Adamson, managing director at Landor Associates and author of ''BrandSimple,'' a book about how to maintain brands. ''Any time ads encroach on a place where they haven't been before, it's one more refuge from the noise that has been taken away. Every time you do this, you'll get people screaming.''\nThe signs have not even been unveiled yet, but the screaming has already started. The borough of Fort Lee, where the toll plaza is located, is considering suing the Port Authority. The borough's mayor, Jack Alter, said the Port Authority did not consult the borough government before approving the signs, and may have run afoul of laws that determine the size and location of the signs.\n''No one talked to us about it,'' Mr. Alter said. ''They are polluting the aesthetics.''\nMr. Sigmund, the Port Authority spokesman, declined to comment on the potential lawsuit. But he said the authority is ''working hard not to litter the bridge with signs.''\n''That's why we're doing it in a very small way and seeing what the impact is,'' he said.
1816678	The Senate's Task on Warming	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E5D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Here are a few bulletins from planet Earth:\nDec. 12 -- Exhaustive computer simulations carried out at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., suggest that the Arctic Ocean will be mostly open water in the summer of 2040 -- several decades earlier than expected. Scientists attribute the loss of summer ice largely to the buildup of carbon dioxide and other man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nDec. 14 -- Experts at NASA's Goddard Institute predict that 2006 will be the fifth-warmest year since modern record-keeping began, continuing a decades-long global warming trend caused, again, by the buildup of man-made carbon dioxide.\nDec. 27 -- The Interior Department proposes adding polar bears to the list of threatened species because of the accelerating loss of the Arctic ice that is the bears' habitat. The department does not take a position on why the ice is melting, but studies supporting the proposed listing identify greenhouse gases as the main culprit, adding that if left unchecked these gases will create ice-free Arctic summers in three decades.\nBut we knew that.\nOne can only assume that the Senate's new Democratic leadership is paying attention. California's Barbara Boxer is the new chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, replacing James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who regards global warming as an elaborate hoax drummed up by environmentalists and scientists in search of money. Ms. Boxer has already scheduled hearings, and there will be no shortage of legislative remedies to consider. All share one objective, which is to attach a cost to carbon dioxide through a cap on emissions.\nThe underlying logic is that if people and industries are made to pay for the privilege of pumping these gases into the atmosphere, they will inevitably be driven to developer cleaner fuels, cleaner cars and cleaner factories.\nThis is the path most developed countries have chosen. Europe has imposed caps on industrial emissions, and European companies have begun investing in new technologies and cleaner factories in places like China, partly as a way to meet their own obligations to cut emissions and partly as a way to lead China to a greener future.\nThese hearings need to be conducted in a thoughtful manner. There has been enough noise, from the Inhofe right and from the doomsayers who see each hurricane as a sign the apocalypse is upon us. But it is also important that Ms. Boxer and her colleagues not lose sight of a fundamental reality: Saturating the atmosphere with greenhouse gases is loading the dice in a dangerous game.\nEditorial
1816679	Making No Small Plans	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E5D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Gov. Eliot Spitzer is fond of saying that you can't change the world by whispering. What New Yorkers saw in his first week in office was a governor in full trumpet about how to overhaul their state government. While some veterans of state politics saw Mr. Spitzer's State of the State speech on Wednesday as too ambitious, former Gov. Hugh Carey got it just right. ''It's a very big agenda,'' he said, ''but it's not too big for New York.''\nWe are still in the promising stage, of course, and the real test will begin later this month with Mr. Spitzer's first executive budget. But he has begun by laying down a number of important, and sensible, markers. On health care, he wants insurance for all children. He hopes to find some of the money to do this by consolidating hospitals and shifting patients from nursing homes to at-home care.\nOn education, Mr. Spitzer says he wants to spread money out more fairly to students who most need it. Suburban lawmakers whose schools are favored by the current formula will object. But he may win them over with his plan to lower property taxes that fall heavily on middle-class suburbanites.\nHe made a strong pitch for economic revitalization upstate, a familiar but elusive goal of a long line of New York politicians.\nMr. Spitzer also proposed a series of reforms that are certain to rile legislators accustomed to lifetime tenure in Albany. He intends to create a nonpartisan redistricting commission and vowed to veto any future district lines that are gerrymandered to make elections uncompetitive. And he wants to ''replace the weakest campaign finance laws in the nation with the strongest.'' That means lowering contribution limits and providing public financing so that moneyed interests can no longer buy political clout.\nAlso on Mr. Spitzer's ambitious to-do list, and appropriately so, are restructuring the courts and organizing the overlapping local governments across the state.\nMr. Spitzer faces two major hurdles. One is finding top-flight appointees to make these proposals a reality. One of the most important sales jobs he has now is convincing enough good people that working for government wages is worth it to help reinvent such a powerful state government. Mr. Spitzer's other challenge will be getting the Legislature to go along. Much of his speech was met with an odd silence from lawmakers. Perhaps it was the way Mr. Spitzer carved out new political territory that does not entirely cater to upstate Republicans or downstate Democrats. But it may simply be that they do not yet know what to make of all that urgency, all those promises, all that work.\nMr. Spitzer certainly acts like a man ready to go forward quickly. The goals he has set may be daunting to the old guard in Albany, but anything less from this governor would have been a grave disappointment.\nEditorial
1816680	Chirac Says Time Proves France Was Right to Resist War	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	In a scathing attack of the American-led war in Iraq, President Jacques Chirac said Friday that his predictions that the war would spread chaos and more terrorism had come true.\n''As France had foreseen and feared, the war in Iraq has sparked upheavals that have yet to show their full effects,'' Mr. Chirac said in his New Year's address at Élysée Palace to the foreign diplomatic corps.\n''This adventure has worsened the divisions among communities and threatened the very integrity of Iraq,'' he said. ''It has undermined the stability of the entire region, where every country now fears for its security and its independence. It has offered terrorism a new field for expansion.''\nAs President Bush prepares to unveil next week a new military strategy in Iraq, Mr. Chirac added that ''the priority, more than ever, is to restore full sovereignty to the Iraqi people.''\nThe single paragraph on Iraq in a speech that addressed many crises and problems around the world was one of Mr. Chirac's most pointed justifications for France's decision to oppose the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nIn a sense, the attack was surprising. France's opposition to the war set off a crisis in French-American relations that has since eased, thanks to close cooperation between the United States and France to resolve the summer's Israeli-Hezbollah war and to curb Iran's nuclear program.\nAs the violence and chaos in Iraq steadily worsened, despite the presence of American troops, the 74-year-old French president tended to avoid reminding the United States of its failures there.\nAfter Mr. Bush's re-election, for example, Mr. Chirac sent him a handwritten ''Cher George'' letter of congratulations. He also gave a speech expressing hope that 2005 would be a year of ''trust'' with Mr. Bush, and congratulated him again after elections took place in Iraq.\nIn Mr. Chirac's last speech to the foreign diplomatic corps, a year ago, he expressed hope that Iraqi elections would help unify Iraqis.\nBut as Mr. Chirac seems unlikely to run for a third term in presidential elections this spring, he may feel he has little to lose in being blunt in defending what some French political analysts call the high point of his foreign policy in his 12-year presidency.\nIn Friday's speech, Mr. Chirac also attacked ''the pitfalls of unilateralism,'' a veiled criticism of the Bush administration for going to war in Iraq without the backing of the United Nations Security Council.\nHe repeated his approval of the emergence of a ''multipolar world'' as countries like China, India and Brazil assume ''the status of global powers.'' The term enrages the Bush administration because it seems to envision a power that competes with American interests and influence.
1816681	Cowher Resigns; Stops Short Of Retiring	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E4D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	In 15 years as the coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Bill Cowher compiled a brilliant record: 161-99-1, 10 playoff seasons, 6 American Football Conference championship games, 2 Super Bowl appearances and, a year ago, a Super Bowl championship. His reign as the N.F.L. coach with the longest tenure ended yesterday, when he resigned, not unexpectedly, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family.\nCowher, 49, said he was not tired of coaching, and he did not say he was retiring. During a news conference in Pittsburgh, someone used the word retirement, and Cowher said, ''That makes you feel old.''\n''I'm not burned out,'' he said. ''But there comes a time in your life -- I'm healthy and happy, and I've been fortunate -- when you've got to prioritize things. My family has made a lot of sacrifices for me, and I'm looking forward to being there for them. It's the right time.''\nHe added: ''I'm looking forward to it, spending time with the family. Working in a world that is so regimented and scheduled, the ability to sit back at my age and spend time with family and be a big part of their lives again really excites me. Right now, all I see myself doing is spending time with my family and working on a golf game that needs a lot of work.''\nCowher and his wife, Kaye, were athletes at North Carolina State in Raleigh. Last summer, they bought a home there, and Kaye and their youngest daughter, Lindsay, moved there. Their older daughters, Meagan and Lauren, attend Princeton.\nCowher, with his fierce look, jutting jaw and mustache, had one of the best-known faces in the N.F.L. He played linebacker from 1979 through 1984 for the Philadelphia Eagles and the Cleveland Browns. In 1985, Marty Schottenheimer, who was the Browns' coach, hired him as the special teams coach.\nCowher, who was born in Pittsburgh, became the Steelers' coach Jan. 21, 1992, at age 34. He replaced Chuck Noll, who retired after 23 seasons as the Steelers' coach.\nCowher's first team posted an 11-5 record, and he was voted coach of the year. His first six teams reached the playoffs, matching the record of the Hall of Fame coach Paul Brown.\nIn 2004, the Steelers drafted Ben Roethlisberger, the first time in 25 years they had chosen a quarterback in the first round. Roethlisberger was expected to sit and learn for a year or two, but when the starter, Tommy Maddox, was injured, Roethlisberger stepped in and won his first 13 starts, a record for a rookie.\nLast season, the Steelers were mired at 7-5 before winning eight consecutive games -- four to end the regular season and four in the playoffs. The streak culminated with a 21-10 victory against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL. The victory gave Pittsburgh its fifth championship, its first since Super Bowl XIV.\nThis season, the Steelers started 2-6, the worst eight-game mark in 20 years for a Super Bowl champion. Roethlisberger was recovering from a broken jaw and nose sustained in a motorcycle accident in June and an appendectomy in September. Pittsburgh finished 8-8 and missed the playoffs.\nCowher had one year left on his contract and, according to The Associated Press, was earning more than $4 million a year. Several other N.F.L. coaches make at least that much; Mike Holmgren of the Seattle Seahawks is the league's highest-paid coach, making about $8 million.\nThe leading candidates to replace Cowher are two Steelers assistants: Ken Whisenhunt, the offensive coordinator, and Russ Grimm, the assistant head coach and offensive line coach. Each has been on the Steelers' staff since 2001. They were teammates on the Washington Redskins; Whisenhunt was a tight end and Grimm was a guard.\nThe Steelers are expected to interview others. Dan Rooney, the club owner, led the move to require teams to consider minority coaches for head-coaching vacancies.\nRooney, a member of the Steelers' founding family, said, ''History will look back on Bill Cowher as one of the greatest coaches of all time.''\nPRO FOOTBALL

Advantage, Colts.\nHowever, the Colts have allowed 173 yards rushing a game, the most in the league, and the Chiefs have a premier runner in Larry Johnson. He carried 416 times (an N.F.L. record) for 1,789 yards and seemed to thrive on heavy duty. Advantage, Chiefs.\nColts Coach Tony Dungy said he was not concerned with how his team closed the regular season, with losses in four of its final seven games.\n''It's kind of like the Indy 500,'' he said. ''You get that starting position and then you run the race. Everyone remembers who won, not who got the pole.''\nReporter's pick: Colts\nDallas (9-7) at Seattle (9-7) 8 p.m., Channel 4 The coaches -- Bill Parcells of the Cowboys and Mike Holmgren of the Seahawks -- have enjoyed playoff success. So have Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck and running back Shaun Alexander, the keys to the Seahawks' offense. Not so Tony Romo, the Cowboys quarterback, and that could be a problem. Dallas's record was 3-3 when the inexperienced Romo replaced Drew Bledsoe. Romo went 5-1 in his first six starts, 1-3 in his last four. He could take advantage of a Seahawks secondary so battered that one starting cornerback is out, the other probably is and three defensive backs were added in recent days. That could also be good news for Terrell Owens, the Cowboys' gifted but talkative receiver.

For the Patriots, the playoffs are something else. Quarterback Tom Brady's playoff record is 10-1, and he has thrown only 5 interceptions in 11 games. He lacks a go-to receiver, but the Patriots have strong runners in Corey Dillon and Laurence Maroney.\nJets receiver Laveranues Coles said of the Patriots: ''That's the last team you ever want to see in the playoffs because of the way they prepare and the experience they have. I didn't really want to play them in the first round. That's not necessarily a feeling of fear or intimidation. It's more like knowing your opponent a little too well.'' Reporter's pick: Patriots\nGiants (8-8) at Philadelphia (10-6) 4:30 p.m., Channel 5 The veteran Jeff Garcia replaced the injured Donovan McNabb (knee) at quarterback and led the Eagles to the National Football Conference East title, Philadelphia's fifth in the past six years. Brian Westbrook, a slick outside runner, also became a force inside as the Eagles won their final five games. ''I believe we are playing our best ball right now,'' safety Brian Dawkins said. The Giants are not; their record is the poorest of the 12 playoff teams. Eli Manning has been inconsistent, Jeremy Shockey is hobbling on a bad ankle, and the defense has its bad days. The one constant has been Tiki Barber, who rushed for a team-record 234 yards last week. He is retiring at 31, so if the Giants lose, this will be his last game.

1816683	Opponents Covet Brains Behind Super Bowl Inc.	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E4D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The huge Super Bowl banners hang from the upper deck of the stadium. Images of the Lombardi Trophy -- three of them -- are silhouetted on the front marquee at Gillette Stadium.\nWhen fans arrive for the ninth home playoff game in the 13 seasons since Robert K. Kraft bought the team, the New England Patriots will not let them forget the success that has transformed the Patriots from laughingstock to case study. But the rest of the National Football League, especially the Jets, needs little reminder that the Patriots are trying to win their fourth Super Bowl in six years.\nThe rest of the N.F.L., after all, is desperate to replicate New England's success. The Patriots' rivals present them with one of the few drawbacks to all those titles: everybody wants their people.\nOn Sunday, the Patriots will face a former New England assistant, Eric Mangini. A year ago, almost everyone thought the Jets were reaching when they hired Mangini, who had been Bill Belichick's defensive coordinator for only one season, perhaps plucking the fruit from Belichick's coaching tree a year or two before it was fully ripe.\nThe decision was chalked up to the Jets owner Woody Johnson's near obsession with how the Patriots run their franchise. Mangini's success makes it even more likely this off-season that opposing teams will try to cull from the Patriots the people who have helped establish the dynasty.\nEven in a season that was marked by unusual ups and downs, the Patriots won six of their last seven games after their loss at home to the Jets on Nov. 12. They have emerged as perhaps the greatest threat to the San Diego Chargers' chances of winning the American Football Conference championship -- just as long as they get past the most recent guy whose career was helped by having the Patriots on his résumé.\n''Eric had the advantage of training under the No. 1 person in the field,'' Kraft said in an interview this week. ''He was smart enough to learn from him. When I hear him, it's a replication of a lot of things Bill did.\n''This year has been a different year. Coach Belichick has done an outstanding job in managing our resources. Scott Pioli has done a great job in the personnel area.''\nWhen Johnson hired Mangini and made Mike Tannenbaum his general manager, he hoped to recreate the chemistry that Belichick and Pioli, the Patriots' vice president of player personnel, share.\nBut the Patriots could lose Pioli this off-season. He is expected to be pursued by several teams with general manager openings, perhaps including the Giants and the Miami Dolphins.\nSpeculation has long centered on whether Pioli, who does not have the general manager title and who shares personnel responsibility with Belichick, would prefer to have complete control and a chance to emerge from the considerable public shadows cast by Belichick and Kraft. And whether he would like to have his own voice. Pioli is rarely permitted to speak to reporters as part of Belichick's one-voice philosophy.\nKraft declined comment on whether he would try to keep Pioli from leaving. Even Belichick's contract status is in question. Belichick and Kraft have long agreed not to discuss his contract, but Belichick is believed to be signed at least through next season.\nThe disciplined financial philosophy that Belichick and Pioli have is the envy of salary-cap gurus everywhere. But this season, it generated some painful personnel losses. Kicker Adam Vinatieri and receiver Deion Branch are in the playoffs with other teams, even though Kraft wanted to keep both.\nKraft learned early in his time as an owner that decisions based on emotions -- he called Branch ''our type of guy'' -- were dangerous. That is how the Patriots have carefully cultivated a team nearly free of superstars and absolutely free of outspoken superstar egos. It is almost impossible to imagine the Patriots tolerating Terrell Owens or even the headline-making talk of the Giants this season.\nWhether the personnel losses will hurt the Patriots in the long run is debatable. The rookie kicker Stephen Gostkowski has never been in the playoffs, while Vinatieri is a legendary clutch kicker.\nThe offense and Tom Brady struggled this season as Brady threw to 15 different receivers, finding a comfortable rhythm with none of them so far.\nBranch languished a bit in Seattle after signing a six-year, $39 million deal with the Seahawks.\nBut in the trade of Branch, the Patriots got something they coveted: a first-round pick from Seattle, which, because of the Seahawks' record, is likely to be somewhere in the middle to late first round. Stockpiling draft picks is a bedrock feature of the Patriots' personnel-acquisition theory and late first-round picks suit them best.\n''The first five to eight picks are noneconomical,'' Kraft said. ''The sweet spot is mid to late first round, where you get players and the pay is market-friendly. We wanted to keep Adam and Deion. But if you make bad decisions, you can't bury your errors. You have to balance that with a sense of loyalty to your players and your emotions.''\nDuring parts of the season, Brady was visibly frustrated with the state of the offense. He yelled at teammates and in a news conference said that everyone needed to pay more attention to their coaches. But as the Patriots prospered in their final three games, playing with no turnovers, Brady's exasperation softened.\n''It's just stuff you've got to get used to as a player,'' Brady said. ''You realize you don't control any of the personnel decisions that go on. Coaches leave. Players leave. When you sign a contract with a team, you're signing up to play, not to coach or make decisions on personnel.''\nThe rest of the N.F.L. wants the Patriots to give -- their players, their executives, their ideas -- until it hurts. But with a chance to add to the banners on the stadium, New England does not seem to have gotten there yet.\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816684	Colorado, Still Recovering From 2 Storms, Is Hit With a 3rd	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E3D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Another winter storm bore down on snow-weary Colorado on Friday, complicating the recovery from back-to-back blizzards in December and raising fears that livestock losses would continue to mount.\nAt least 1,000 head of cattle were confirmed dead, most of them smothered by drifts when they bunched together along fence lines.\n''This is far from over,'' said Don Ament, the state's agriculture commissioner.\nThe latest storm was a pallid reflection of the two holiday-week behemoths that brought as much as four feet of snow between them to parts of the Denver area and shut down Denver International Airport for two days during the peak travel period just before Christmas.\nBut even an additional six to eight inches of snow, predicted through early Saturday, was a reminder of how wildly divergent the nation's weather has become this winter, with East Coast residents in shirtsleeves and sandals while people here and across the Plains and Southwest are overwhelmed by reminders of the season's potential for havoc.\nA spokeswoman for the Colorado Division of Emergency Management, Polly White, said the biggest concern in the state's hard-hit southeast corner on Friday was wind. Across an eight-county area, 25 percent of the roads were still impassable a week after the last storm, Ms. White said, and gusts up to 35 miles per hour were predicted from the new one.\nBad weather grounded Colorado National Guard flights that had been dropping hay to cattle stranded by drifts as high as 15 feet in places like Prowers County on the Kansas border, Ms. White said. Relief efforts were continuing on Friday using tractors and four-wheel-drive trucks.\n''We're hoping that the winds predicted in the southeast don't blow the snow back over and cover the roads,'' Ms. White said. ''Then we're starting over.''\nBut the pictures on television of buried cars, collapsed roofs, disgruntled travelers and worried farmers also belie the mixed impact of the weather.\nThe snow cost Denver's airport as much as $11 million, according to preliminary estimates by airport administrators, mainly for cleanup and lost revenue from canceled flights. But many Denver hotels had their best December in years as stranded travelers and downtown office workers took shelter.\nCattle losses could rise into the tens of millions of dollars, farm experts said, perhaps even approaching the estimated $28 million in farm-animal deaths in a blizzard in 1997. But winter wheat farmers, whose lands have been parched by years of drought, were exulting. The deep snows, they say, will almost certainly produce the best crop in years.\nSki resort operators said that thousands of visitors were kept away from the slopes during the storms by the closed airport and the bad roads, but that news coverage of Denver's plight during those same snowbound hours had also proved to be the kind of advertising money cannot buy, prompting a surge of reservations and telephone calls.\nThe Aspen Skiing Company, which operates four resorts around Aspen in central Colorado, had 3,000 to 4,000 fewer skier-days through the Christmas week than expected, with each skier-day worth $50 to $75, said Jeff Hanle, a company spokesman.\n''But the reservation center had some of the busiest days ever,'' Mr. Hanle added. ''It gave us a real blip for February and March bookings.''\nAnd the storms also revealed, residents and local officials say, how much the political and demographic pattern of the West continues to evolve.\nAgriculture, while still important to Colorado's economy, is increasingly dwarfed by the clout of Denver and its suburbs, which swallowed up most of the available snow-removal equipment and worsened the trouble on ranches and farms.\nSince 1997, when the last great blizzard hit cow-country Colorado, the number of cattle statewide has fallen by 25 percent, to around three million from about four million, according to the State Agriculture Department.\n''A lot of the equipment isn't available to go out to the rural areas because it's contracted to the cities,'' said Barry Cooper, the president and chief executive of Farm Credit of Southern Colorado, a bank in Colorado Springs that specializes in agriculture.\nInsurance concerns have compounded the disparity, Mr. Cooper said, since municipalities have the resources to protect snow-removal contractors from liability, while rural areas with lots of private ranch roads mostly do not.\nBut life was grinding back to normal, even in the snowiest spots.\nJason Dittburner, 33, who drives a 150-mile-a-day route through Southeast Colorado in a Hostess-Wonder Bread van, delivering supplies to grocers, was back on the job on Wednesday, the first day roads were clear enough to make his route since Dec. 29, and Dorothy Grano, for one, was happy to see him.\n''The shelves were getting pretty empty,'' said Ms. Grano, the assistant manager of the Rocky Ford Mini-Mart, about two-and-a-half hours south of Denver, as Mr. Dittburner walked in with his racks of bread, snack cakes and fruit pies.\nRanchers say the next worry on the horizon is calving season, which is just beginning.\nDale Butler, who manages about 700 head of cattle near the Kansas border for himself and a partner, said in a telephone interview that his cows were expecting about 350 calves between now and early April, and that he had lost six so far in the cold snap that followed the snows.\n''It was so cold they wouldn't try to get up to nurse,'' Mr. Butler said.
1816685	Giddy Sea of Fresh Faces In the Capitol, United By a Serious Mission	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E3D81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Hours after casting his first votes in Congress, Representative Zack Space still beamed with excitement on Thursday, showing off the identification card that doubles as an electronic balloting device.\n''I had to ask someone how to use it,'' he said, proudly whisking the card out of its carrying case as he gave his family a tour of the Capitol.\nBack in his office, a new receptionist apologized for hanging up on someone who called. ''Sorry, second day on the job,'' she chirped.\nEven before his arrival in Washington this week, Mr. Space, 45, typified the incoming freshman class: A Democrat from Ohio, he campaigned hard on the issue of ethics reform in a race to succeed Representative Bob Ney, who pleaded guilty in a corruption case. Despite his political inexperience -- and the fact that Democratic officials considered him one of their weakest candidates -- Mr. Space beat his Republican rival, in an increasingly Republican district, 62 percent to 38 percent.\nNow, he is one of 66 new members of the 110th Congress, part of a historic Democratic tide that swept Republicans from power after a dozen years and left President Bush on the defensive.\nAlthough Mr. Space at times exudes a certain good-natured goofiness -- his campaign Web logo featured a starry rendering of outer space, and one of his mottos is a riff on his father's first name, Socrates (''being the son of Socrates, Zack Space knows a thing or two about ethics'') -- he has a mission of the utmost seriousness in Congress. On Thursday, his first day, before all his boxes were unpacked and his shared apartment furnished, Mr. Space was given a high-profile role in introducing his party's ethics reform package.\n''The winds of change have brought me here,'' Mr. Space said in his first speech on the House floor, arguing in favor of the package. ''The time to act is now. We have an extraordinary burden to prove to those who have given us this honor. We must make clear to them that we are representing their interests, not bartering legislative favors in order to gain gifts and trips.''\nOn the other side of the Capitol dome, the incoming senators will not cast their first votes until next week (and the first one, a resolution honoring the late President Gerald R. Ford, will not exactly cause heartburn). Their transition will take longer in other ways: new senators are housed in temporary offices in the basement, while administrators try to establish which sitting senators intend to move.\nThat left freshman Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat who previously lived on an 1,800-acre ranch in Montana, squeezed into a small space in the bowels of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. In the office of Senator James Webb, Democrat of Virginia, the phone system was so problem-plagued that his line remained busy for hours on end.\nBut the wave of newcomers was most palpable in the House, where the dozens of arrivals circulated through welcome parties, herded their families on tours and waited in long lines to have their photographs taken with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the new House speaker. Representative Carol Shea Porter, a New Hampshire Democrat who won an upset victory, let out an audible gasp when she set foot on the House floor the first time, said her chief of staff, Harry Gural.\n''Walking in was a little bit like walking into the lights of Yankee Stadium, going out onto the field as a player rather than a spectator,'' Mr. Gural said.\nThe cable network channel C-Span chronicled even the most anonymous new members, setting up a camera position in the Cannon House Office Building to lure members of the freshman class into interviews.\n''So far, so good,'' said Representative Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii (and one of two new Buddhist members of the Congress), as she concluded her 15 minutes of C-Span.\nMs. Hirono had a press schedule, but little else: unable to buy office gear until she was sworn in, the newest Democrat from the farthest state was working without computers.\nUnlike earlier eras, when newcomers simply showed up in Washington and had to fend for themselves, freshmen now undergo a series of orientation programs in the weeks between Election Day and the swearing-in.\n''It's much different than when I came here. You were on your own,'' said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat now in his 17th term.\nRepresentative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and another House lifer, offered the freshmen some advice: Learn time management, and how to resist invitations to social events.\n''The default answer when people ask you to do things should be 'no,' '' Mr. Frank said.\nThen there is the issue of housing, always tricky for members of Congress who are in Washington on weekdays but at home in their districts most weekends. Mr. Space and his new roommate, Representative Michael Arcuri of New York, moved into their ''small, subterranean'' apartment earlier in the week, an arrangement prompted in part by Mr. Arcuri's fondness for Mr. Space's Greek cooking. By Friday, they still appeared to be getting along.\nAnd Mr. Space, grinning as he wandered the halls, had not grown disillusioned by Washington, he said, nor strayed from his pledges.\n''Not yet,'' he said, when asked if he had broken any campaign promises. Then he corrected himself. ''I mean -- no.''\nCONGRESSIONAL MEMO

1816690	Just Days Into the Year, Killings Toll Hits 8 in New Orleans	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803EFD81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	A surge in murders since the new year has residents on edge and has raised new fears that officials here remain helpless to contain a lethal combination of guns, drugs and jobless young men.\nThe worries are particularly acute as this city struggles to repopulate 17 months after Hurricane Katrina.\nEight people have been found dead since Jan. 1, seven of them shooting victims, with the most recent being a young woman found lying on her bed in the Uptown section Friday morning, shot in the head.\nAs the police were scrambling to investigate that killing and the others, mostly of young men gunned down in high-crime areas, grief-stricken neighbors gathered outside the house of Helen Hill, an independent filmmaker, and her husband, Dr. Paul Gailiunas, who were shot by an intruder early Thursday morning in the Faubourg Marigny section, the authorities said.\nMs. Hill, 36, well known in the local film community and the recipient of several awards, was killed; Dr. Gailiunas, who specialized in treating the city's poor, survived his wounds. The police found him kneeling by the front door, bleeding and holding the couple's 2-year-old son in his arms. His wife lay nearby, shot in the neck. The child was not hurt.\nThat crime, breaking the typical pattern of drug-related shootings, helped prompt a front-page headline in The Times-Picayune on Friday: ''Killings bring the city to its bloodied knees.''\nThe spate of murders came after a New Year's Day statement by the city's police superintendent, Warren J. Riley, that New Orleans had been made safer because the 2006 murder total was the lowest in 30 years.\nBut the assertion was questionable even before these killings started. On a per-capita basis, because of the city's drastically reduced population after Hurricane Katrina, the murder rate of at least 81 per 100,000 people in 2006 easily makes New Orleans one of the most violent cities in the nation.\nOn Friday, flowers and scribbled remembrances fronted the modest duplex of Ms. Hill and her husband on North Rampart Street, in a picturesque neighborhood of old Creole cottages frequented by tourists and local residents escaping the crowds of the nearby French Quarter.\nBoth were remembered as outsiders -- Dr. Gailiunas is from Canada, friends said, and his wife from South Carolina -- with a fervent commitment to the city's culture and its underclass.\n''You know what, it's horrifying: you kill my wife, you shoot me while I'm holding my baby,'' said Darlene Wright, who said Dr. Gailiunas had treated her two sons at the low-cost clinic he started on Esplanade Avenue. ''He was different from the other doctors. It didn't matter what your color or culture. He cared about the people.''\nFriends said Dr. Gailiunas had been released from the hospital Friday afternoon and that he planned to return to Canada. The police said his wounds were not life-threatening but they could not confirm his release.\nMs. Hill, a Harvard graduate and recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship, had shown her films at numerous festivals in Canada and the United States.\n''Things didn't matter to them, their whole focus was on people and partaking in the culture of what was happening in New Orleans,'' said Carlton Charles, Dr. Gailiunas's landlord at the Esplanade clinic.\nPreviously, the doctor had worked in the high-crime, impoverished Central City area.\n''He wanted to reach out to the poor and the underprivileged, people he felt had a lot of needs,'' Dr. Henry Evans, a colleague there, said.\nOn Friday, David Jones, the owner of a bed-and-breakfast near the couple's home, described how, shortly before the shooting, a lanky gun-wielding intruder -- possibly the same one who shot the couple -- had forced his way into his establishment, but apparently fled after panicked guests called the police.\nThe other recent killings followed a depressingly familiar pattern. Earlier Thursday, the police found a young man with gunshot wounds lying face-down in a Central City alleyway; on Wednesday evening, they responded to a report of gunshots in the same neighborhood and found another young man dead; that afternoon, Louisiana National Guardsmen found the body of a man shot in the head in the Desire area, in the Ninth Ward; and on Wednesday morning, they found the body of a woman wrapped in a rug in the Lower Ninth Ward.\nThe National Guard is patrolling several sections of the city at the request of the Police Department, which is still low on manpower. Superintendent Riley, who has been out of town, and other senior police officials did not respond to requests for comment on the violence.\nCompounding residents' fears here is the apparent inability of the criminal justice system to successfully prosecute the murderers. A study by the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans, a foundation, found that from October 2003 to September 2004, only 12 percent of those arrested for murder were incarcerated.\n''You know, there are people in this neighborhood trying to bring it back,'' said Mr. Jones, the bed-and-breakfast owner. ''I'm tired of this. I'm ready to torch the whole neighborhood.''
1816691	Two Teenagers Confess to Committing Deadly Spree of Robberies in Queens Park, Police Say	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02EFD81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The trail of the crime spree is brutal and damning: a burned-out minivan, a string of victims viciously beaten and robbed, a dead man's body found floating near a boathouse in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens.\nBehind the monthlong mayhem are two teenagers, the police said yesterday, and they said one of them, who is homeless, told investigators that he and his partner beat and robbed lone strollers in the park for cash to buy food. On Thursday, the police arrested the homeless teenager, Belter Yovanni Gubara Rivera, 17, and charged him with murder in the death of Carlos Flores, 40. Mr. Flores was an immigrant from Ecuador whose body was found floating in a pond in the park on Dec. 5. Mr. Rivera was also charged with four counts of robbery.\nThe police arrested the second teenager, Marcos Polanco, 17, who they say was Mr. Rivera's partner, at his home in Corona a day earlier. He was charged with attempted murder and four counts of robbery.\nThe teenagers are accused of committing four robberies in the park from Nov. 22 to Dec. 25, attacking men who were walking alone. After spotting a mark, they would follow him for awhile, creep up from behind, then try to knock him out, said Lt. Edward Ruttler of the 110th Precinct. In at least two of the robberies, they threatened their victims with a knife, Lieutenant Ruttler said. The two are also suspected in four other robberies that took place during that same time span.\n''They both said they did it for food,'' the lieutenant said. Mr. Rivera, he said, had been kicked out of a relative's house two months ago and had been sleeping in an abandoned building at 104th Street and Otis Avenue.\nMr. Rivera, whose nickname is Nyquil, ''was known to put people to sleep,'' Lieutenant Ruttler said, ''to knock them out with one punch.''\n''Even though he wasn't physically big, Yovanni knew how to throw a punch,'' he said.\nThe police said the two became ruthless in their attacks, which usually yielded less than handsome returns. But for the pittance they took, their victims paid a hefty cost.\nOne victim, Jae Woo Park, 36, of Little Neck, was attacked and severely beaten on Dec. 25, the police said. The circumstances of the attack were unclear yesterday, but at some point, Mr. Park's 2007 Honda Odyssey was taken and set on fire, the police said. The minivan was later found, burning, near the Horace Harding Expressway. Mr. Park, the police said, was still unconscious yesterday at Elmhurst Hospital Center.\nWhen he was arrested, Mr. Rivera had severe burns on his face, said Louis Croce, the chief of detectives in Queens. The medical examiner's office has said the burns were the result of a flash ignition injury consistent with someone setting a vehicle on fire, the police said.\nThe teenagers' crime spree turned deadly on Dec. 4, the police said, when they set upon Mr. Flores, who lived in Ridgewood, Queens. He fought back, but paid with his life.\nHis body, with multiple slash wounds and skull fractures, was found at 10:30 the next morning, floating in the pond, the police said. Lieutenant Ruttler said Mr. Rivera had used a machete in the attack.\nMr. Polanco, a dishwasher in Manhattan, has no criminal history. Mr. Rivera was arrested once before, but the details were sealed, police said.\nInvestigators tracked down the teenagers using evidence like transaction records from a credit card the pair are accused of stealing from one victim, and the burned-out minivan, which investigators were able to trace to Mr. Park, the police said. But most damning of all, they said, were the young men's confessions.
1816692	Camera Sees Officer Fishing for Restaurant's Lobster, Authorities Say	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEFD81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	One night in October, a police officer in Madison, a small coastal Connecticut town, called in to dispatchers, telling them that he noticed a door to a restaurant had been left ajar. Not to worry, he said, he would check it out.\nIn went the officer, Joseph R. Gambardella, though he did not use the usual protocol to search for an intruder, like reaching for his weapon or calling for backup, according to a state police officer who investigated the matter. Rather, Officer Gambardella, toting a large trash bag, went right for the freezer.\nOfficer Gambardella rummaged through a few plastic tubs, according to the state police officer's affidavit, removing a few packages of lobster meat.\nAnd out he went, closing the door behind him.\nLittle did he know that security cameras installed at the restaurant to monitor employees showed him emerging from the freezer with his trash bag weighed down, apparently with a hefty supply of lobster meat.\nAlthough the affidavit from the state trooper includes a detailed account of what was captured on the security tape, Officer Gambardella's lawyer said on Thursday that his client planned to plead not guilty to charges including two counts of burglary and two counts of larceny. The officer is accused of taking 21 bags of lobster meat worth $44 each, and two bags of shrimp, which cost $18.60 apiece.\n''The tape seems damaging,'' the officer's lawyer, Hugh F. Keefe, said this week. ''Of course, we have a defense.''\nBut neither Mr. Keefe nor Officer Gambardella, 48, who was accompanied to court this week by his pregnant wife, Kathleen, gave any indication what that defense might be.\nOfficer Gambardella, a 15-year veteran of the Madison Police Department who lives in Guilford, was disciplined once before for ''conduct unbecoming,'' according to the town's police chief, Paul D. Jakubson. ''But that's usually nothing serious,'' Chief Jakubson said, adding that he had not received any complaints about Officer Gambardella -- who earned more than $127,000 last year by working overtime shifts -- in the last decade.\nLenny and Joe's Fish Tale along Route 1 in Madison, 20 miles south of New Haven, is not a place for high-end dining. The lobster special, at $12.99, comes with French fries and coleslaw.\nJoseph Schreck, one of the owners, called the police after he noticed that a few bags of the crustaceans had disappeared in August and October. And he watched the tape from the hidden camera, thinking perhaps an employee had stolen the food. In both instances, the restaurant's alarm had been activated just after midnight.\nInstead, the camera captured Officer Gambardella heading for the cooler and, according to the affidavit, emerging with an ''expanded and weighed-down'' trash bag; then, he appeared to be talking to the alarm security company, using a white towel to cover the receiver.\nMr. Schreck is not exactly thrilled with the publicity surrounding his fast-food seafood place, which has served clams, lobster and shrimp along the shore since 1979. And he declined to elaborate on the case and charges against Officer Gambardella, saying he did not ''want to encourage people to write about this.''\n''It's an awkward situation all around,'' Mr. Schreck said in a brief telephone conversation. ''There's nothing for us to be gained by talking about it.''\nOfficer Gambardella has been on paid leave since October, pending the completion of a criminal investigation.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Keefe, the lawyer, said that Officer Gambardella was not the first person to be accused of stealing shellfish.\n''Have I ever represented anybody who was accused of taking lobster meat and shrimp theft before? The answer is yes,'' he said. ''Lobster theft is very common. We're on the shore. There are a lot of lobster pots around here.''\nCorrection: January 20, 2007, Saturday An article on Jan. 6 about a police officer in Madison, Conn., who is accused of stealing lobster meat and shrimp from a local seafood restaurant, referred incorrectly to the town's location. Madison is 20 miles east -- not south -- of New Haven.
1816693	The Neediest Cases; A Single Mother Takes Charge, Trading Helplessness for Ambition	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CEFD81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	''Blood'' is spray painted over the front door of the apartment building where Patricia Barnes's family lives. It appears again and again on the walls of the stairwell leading to their second-floor apartment.\nMs. Barnes, 38, is raising two teenagers in the tough East New York neighborhood in Brooklyn, and she is doing everything she can to keep them off these streets.\nAbout five years ago, she sent her four younger children, now ages 11 to 13, to live with their father's extended family in Ivory Coast, where she believed they would be safer.\n''I think that is the best decision I made,'' said Ms. Barnes, who calls Ivory Coast to speak with her children two or three times a week. ''The way things are running around out here nowadays, I don't want them out here. I don't want him out here.''\nBy ''him,'' Ms. Barnes meant her son Raymond, 14, who is a high school freshman. Her daughter Chaka Ward, 17, who prefers to be called Tisha, is a sophomore.\nMs. Barnes said she began seeing worrisome changes in Raymond when he was in junior high school.\n''He was doing pretty good in school, and then, I don't know,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''It's like he woke up and he just, 'I don't want to do it no more.' ''\nRaymond agreed. ''I was a loose cannon,'' he said, adding that he was ''running wild.''\nHe was skipping school, outside at all hours, quick-tempered and willing to fight. Such behavior would be frustrating for any parent, but for Ms. Barnes, who sometimes hears gunfire from her window, it was frightening. She waited up for him at night. She worried that despite his youth, Raymond's height -- at 14 he is already 6-foot-3 -- might get him in adult-sized trouble.\n''It felt like my whole world was crumbling,'' she said. ''I was losing control of him, and that's the one thing I felt should never, ever happen.''\nMs. Barnes took any help she could find, including a warning from Raymond's basketball coach that bad behavior would keep him on the bench.\n''She slowed me down, started making me think,'' Raymond said about his coach. ''I really wanted to be on the team. So I started calming down, letting a lot of things slide.''\nBut Raymond's behavior did not change overnight. An altercation at school led to more absences, and in December 2005, Ms. Barnes applied for a Person In Need of Supervision petition. The petition would give Family Court the power to force Raymond to attend school.\nRather than grant the petition, the court referred the family for counseling at the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.\nThey began attending counseling sessions in February at the bureau's East New York Family Center. Ms. Barnes goes weekly, and Tisha and Raymond accompany her monthly.\nAfter 10 months of counseling, changes are evident in Ms. Barnes's life. She is training for a new job and earned her G.E.D. last month.\nMs. Barnes had worked as a home health aide for years, but it was unstable income, and she relied on public assistance to make ends meet.\nIn October, Ms. Barnes started a job training program through public assistance. She works for the Parks Department, cleaning city parks. She describes the program as ''giving you your responsibility: to be a part of the working class,'' she said, ''which is a beautiful thing, because I love it.''\nShe earns about $320 a week and receives $115 in food stamps each month. Her share of the rent for her subsidized four-bedroom apartment is $150 a month. Her job training program ends in March, and she hopes to be hired permanently.\nMs. Barnes said she cherished the time she spent with her oldest children studying for the G.E.D. exam. Tisha helped her with language, and Raymond studied algebra with her.\n''He actually took a genuine interest in it,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''It was so amazing for us to just lay across the bed and just talk about it.''\n''I'm proud of my accomplishments,'' she said. ''Your kids have something to look up to.''\nCascille Andela, a social worker who counsels the family, said she had seen a big change in Ms. Barnes's ability to cope with adversity.\n''She is able to come home and be more relaxed, understanding, and trying to work though problems rather than getting frustrated and throwing her hands up,'' Ms. Andela said.\nAfter a home visit in which she noticed that Raymond and Ms. Barnes were both sleeping in the living room, Ms. Andela used $965 from the Neediest Cases to replace the family's worn mattresses.\n''You've got to have a bed to sleep in,'' Ms. Andela said. ''You can't go to work the next morning if you can't get to sleep at night.''\nMs. Barnes hopes that her children will draw inspiration from her efforts. In December, Tisha started her first job, working at a day care center. ''I don't care where she worked as long as the little girl knows it's going to feel good to get a paycheck,'' Ms. Barnes said.\nAs for Raymond, he is getting in fewer fights, and is working at grade level for the first time after eight years in special education classes, where he had been placed because of his behavior. He grudgingly admits this year's schoolwork is a little more interesting. Ms. Barnes and Ms. Andela are still working on persuading him to attend school regularly, but he is no longer roaming the streets.\nBit by bit, Ms. Barnes and her family seem to be gaining ground.\n''I've made it my business to not let anything stop me from achieving my goals,'' she said.\nHOW TO HELP\nChecks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245, or any of these organizations:\nBROOKLYN BUREAU OF COMMUNITY SERVICE 285 Schermerhorn Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES, DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS 191 Joralemon Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK 1011 First Avenue New York, N.Y. 10022\nCHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nFEDERATION OF PROTESTANT WELFARE AGENCIES 281 Park Avenue South New York, N.Y. 10010\nUJA-FEDERATION OF NEW YORK Church Street Station P.O.

1816694	Experts Label Falling Object In New Jersey A Meteorite	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05EED81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	It was not from the neighborhood.\nThe object that tore through the roof of a house in the New Jersey suburbs earlier this week was an iron meteorite, perhaps billions of years old and maybe ripped from the belly of an asteroid, experts who examined it said yesterday.\nTentatively named ''Freehold Township'' for the place where it landed -- and ruined a second-floor bathroom -- the meteorite is only the second found in New Jersey, said Jeremy S. Delaney, a Rutgers University expert who examined it.\n''It's a pretty exciting find,'' said Dr. Delaney, who has examined thousands of meteorites. He said that the first New Jersey meteorite was found in 1829, in the seaside town of Deal.\nThe meteorite now belongs to the family whose house it ended up in, said Lt. Robert Brightman of the Freehold Township Police Department. The family has asked not to be identified. For the time being, their meteorite is being safeguarded by the police.\nThe family has not yet given permission for physical testing of the meteorite, but from looking at it, Dr. Delaney and other experts were able to tell that the object it had been part of cooled relatively quickly.\n''Which could mean hundreds or thousands of years,'' said Dr. Delaney. ''On a geological time scale, fast and slow are funny words,'' he added.\nIt is magnetic, and reasonably dense, they determined. The leading edge -- the one that faced forward as it traveled through the earth's atmosphere -- was much smoother, while the so-called trailing edge seemed to have caught pieces of molten metal.\nIn fact, Mr. Delaney said, it seemed remarkably similar to another meteorite fragment, the Ahnighito, now on display at the American Museum of Natural History.\n''This little guy is a lot like it,'' he said. ''It's a good candidate for the core of an asteroid.''\nAnd the scientists are hoping that the owners of the ''Freehold Township'' will make it available for testing and public viewing, like the Ahnighito, a 34-ton chunk of the Cape York meteorite found in Greenland.\nOr, they could sell it.\n''The worth of a meteorite like this is almost completely determined by where it fell,'' said Eric Twelker, a geologist and a dealer in meteorites, who buys and sells perhaps a hundred of them a month on his Web site, meteoritemarket.com. He was speaking of the premium placed on meteorites with a compelling back story, like the football-size rock that crashed into a parked Chevrolet in Peekskill, N.Y., in 1992.\n''The fact that it crashed into a house in New Jersey makes it very valuable,'' he said.\nMr. Twelker said he occasionally sells other pieces of the Cape York meteorite, which go for between $5 and $10 a gram. The Freehold meteorite, which weighs 377 grams, or about 13 ounces, might sell for as much $200 a gram, he said.
1816695	At Home Depot, the New Chief Needs to Sell an Old Story to Wall Street	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06EED81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Frank Blake, the new chief at Home Depot, has a challenge.\nAlmost everything that Robert L. Nardelli, his former boss, did, Mr. Blake had a hand in: doubling revenue and profit in six years; running the company more efficiently; building the new Home Depot Supply for professional builders.\nIndeed, Supply is the piece of the company that critics most attack. Mr. Blake was its architect.\nMr. Nardelli and his giant paycheck are gone, and so is his oft-criticized imperious style. But the ills that dog the company still remain: how to rebuild its reputation among home-renovating consumers, improve customer service and increase the number of shoppers at Home Depot stores.\nAnd to lift the sagging stock price, which fell for a second day yesterday, Mr. Blake needs to sell his story to Wall Street, particularly the concept of why a wholesale business catering to professional builders goes hand-in-hand with one that focuses on the individual consumer. ''Either management needs to learn how to sell the story or begin telling a different story,'' said Patricia Edwards, a senior vice president of Wentworth, Hauser & Violich, an investment firm that owns Home Depot shares.\nHome Depot has said that the two businesses combined would have greater clout with suppliers. But margins in the commercial business are much lower than those in retail, and many analysts have complained that management is siphoning resources from the core stores to finance a business that is less profitable.\nHome Depot Supply already accounts for about 12 percent of Home Depot's $90 billion in sales, and Home Depot executives say that it will be a $25 billion business by 2010.\nMr. Blake must somehow persuade analysts of the value of the commercial business. But he has a handicap that also plagued his predecessor: experience that is high on operations skills, but low on merchandising acumen.\n''Frank Blake won't be as divisive or controversial as far as personality goes, but he is not a radical departure,'' said Danielle E. Fox, an analyst at Merrill Lynch with a buy rating on Home Depot shares.\nRetail experts worry about the similarities. ''Home Depot is profitable and growing, and moving into Supply was exactly the right thing to do,'' said George Whalin, president of Retail Management Consultants. ''But Blake is not a retail visionary, and too many of the merchants that made Home Depot great are gone. He has to surround himself with people who can explain both the art and the science of retailing.''\nHome Depot must also breathe new life into its stores, accelerate its program to modernize them, and make the product displays more inviting for browsers.\nMeasured by sales at stores open more than a year, Lowe's, the prime competitor, has long outpaced Home Depot. Lowe's stores are generally newer and spiffier. But more important, some retail specialists say, they offer a better mix of products and better service.\nWalter J. Salmon, who teaches executive programs in retailing at the Harvard Business School, suggests that Home Depot adopt the Lowe's system of category management, a system in which managers are responsible for everything for a product line, from inventory to advertising to service. ''The category managers make it easier for Lowe's to respond to the unique needs that customers have for different kinds of products and services,'' he said.\nStill, even category managers could not ease the strains on store work forces that have simply been stretched too thin. Home Depot employees complain that Mr. Nardelli, in his zeal for controlling costs and centralizing decision-making, cut too many experienced sales workers.\n''All of us felt that the raises we should have gotten were going into Nardelli's pocket,'' said one hourly worker at a Brooklyn Home Depot, where the news of Mr. Nardelli's departure played to wide applause.\nThe woman, who feared to attach her name to criticism, said that Mr. Nardelli had brought in inexperienced workers, replacing many of the retired plumbers, electricians and such, who had taken up second careers in sales at Home Depot.\n''I used to be able to find an expert to answer any customer's questions,'' she said. ''But he dumbed down the work force, and the customer service has gone way down.''\nHome Depot executives declined to elaborate on strategic details this week. But in an interview that predated Mr. Nardelli's ouster, Carol E. Tome, the chief financial officer, said the company had committed another $350 million to its store modernization program.\n''We're investing in merchandise and labor; we've added self-checkout; we're rewarding associates for customer service; we're doing everything our customers say they want,'' she said. ''It may not translate into sales right away, but it absolutely bodes well for the long term.''\nAnalysts are divided on the stock. According to Thomson Financial, 10 analysts have buy recommendations on the shares, and 13 have holds or sells, with no changes since Mr. Nardelli stepped down. Home Depot's shares ended 2006 down 2.6 percent.\nRumors are swirling that Home Depot will be bought by a private equity firm, or will break itself up. But few investors are banking on those outcomes.\n''This is a gigantic company whose costs have been squeezed out,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which owns Home Depot shares. ''It has to spend money to fix up stores, not cut more costs. So I don't think a buyout will happen.''\nTo be fair, Lowe's, whose shares dropped by 7.2 percent in 2006, is no longer a universal Wall Street darling either: 11 analysts recommend the stock, and 11 rate it hold or sell. Still, retail specialists praise Lowe's management for continuing to focus primarily on retail sales, while Home Depot executives have steadily focused the corporate spotlight on the commercial side.\nHome Depot argues that the $200 billion do-it-yourself market is mature. Professional builders represent a $410 billion market that is wide open for new players. The business operates out of big warehouses on low-priced real estate. While return on sales is lower than for retail, return on capital is higher.\n''If we only played in the do-it-yourself retail space, we'd have no room to grow,'' Ms. Tome said in the recent interview.
1816696	A Future With The Wind	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EED81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	AES, the big power company, is branching out to wind power generation and other alternative energy. The company, which generates and distributes electricity in 26 countries, is also entering the $28 billion carbon trading market, where credits are exchanged to reduce or offset greenhouse gas emissions. Its chief executive, Paul Hanrahan, sat down in his office at the company's sleek new headquarters in Arlington, Va., to discuss these developments. Following are excerpts:\nQ. Last spring, AES announced plans to invest about $1 billion over the next three years in alternative energy projects, specifically wind power generation and biomass. What business factors led to that decision?\nA. We had decided that it was time to look at the alternative energy field as an area that was a good fit with our strategy. We saw that alternative energy was attractive from the environmental standpoint and from the energy security standpoint. And it is really the area with the highest growth potential. The wind industry is expected to triple in size by 2015, so it's going from about 73 gigawatts to over 200 gigawatts.\nQ. AES appears to have adopted several strategies in its expansion into wind generation, buying companies outright as well as buying majority interest -- does that give you more mobility to get into markets quickly?\nA. What it allows us to do is to take advantage of our global footprint. We are in 26 countries, and by buying a company in a region we can take that skill set the company has and expand it globally. A good example is our SeaWest acquisition where we bought a U.S. wind company, and we're developing U.S. wind projects as well as expanding into countries like Bulgaria, Scotland and France. And we're looking at new projects in India, China and the Czech Republic.\nQ. AES has had record revenue recently -- a 14 percent increase to $3.15 billion in the third quarter. Why is that?\nA. We are one of the few global power companies that not only is operating in developed countries but also in emerging markets, which, with respect to electricity, have much higher growth rates. We consciously got into this area because there is a high need to get power into these markets for economic growth, and it allows us as a company to grow much faster.\nQ. Several years ago, the company's bottom line was tripped up by foreign currency transaction problems. What have you done to guard against a recurrence?\nA. We have dramatically reduced the amount of debt, and in various locations we've refinanced dollar debt with local currency debt so we don't have that same kind of foreign currency exposure.\nQ. One of AES's new ventures is liquefied natural gas terminals. Are the prices for natural gas high enough to justify that kind of investment?\nA. We have three terminals in development right now. The U.S. is running out of natural gas -- production is declining and demand growing -- so the expectation is that the import levels will go from 3 percent today to about 24 percent in 2020. The constraint is, How do you get it into the country? If the three are successful, we will continue to look for opportunities to develop L.N.G. terminals.\nQ. Where are those liquid natural gas terminals?\nA. The Bahamas, to provide gas to the Florida market, Baltimore and one offshore in Boston.\nQ. How do AES's ventures in alternative energy relate to climate change?\nA. We developed it as a way to mitigate carbon emissions from our plants. We started doing this in the early '90s. For example, for our power plant in Connecticut, we planted 50 million trees in Guatemala. This new effort is a continuation of that theme, but looking at it now not as a social responsibility project but as something that has profit potential given that people are buying these credits in Europe and are likely to continue buying them.\nQ. In July, AES announced the installation of clean coal technology at your power plant in Dresden, N.Y. With future oil supplies so problematical, what do you see as coal's future?\nA. For countries with coal as an indigenous resource, coal has a lot of potential because you can do a lot to reduce the particulate emissions and the sulfur nitrogen emissions which cause acid rain. You can reduce the carbon emissions from a power plant very cheaply, so we think there is a lot of potential to produce electricity in an environmentally responsible way. SATURDAY INTERVIEW
1816697	China Moves to Tighten the Money Supply	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00EED81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	China's central bank said late Friday that it had raised the reserve requirement ratio for banks, the fourth increase in six months, to further tighten the nation's money supply.\nThe modest move, which takes effect this month, increases the reserve ratio by half a percentage point, to 9.5 percent. Analysts said it was the government's latest warning that too much money in the financial system could ignite inflation and perhaps fuel a stock market bubble.\n''This is a warning shot,'' said Dong Tao, the chief economist for non-Japan Asia at Credit Suisse. ''If the stock market continues to go up, we might see further tightening.''\nRaising the amount of cash reserves that Chinese banks keep on hand with the central bank effectively restricts the amount of money that banks can lend. While not being very restrictive, the central bank aims to curb excessive lending to new factories, real estate projects and road construction.\nThe move also comes as China's stock market is booming after several years in the doldrums. Last year, the country's key index -- the Shanghai exchange -- rose 130 percent to close at 2,675, a record and the best performance of any major stock exchange in the world in 2006.\nThe market reached a 16-year high in December, as millions of investors who had been sitting on the sidelines in 2004 and 2005 jumped back into stocks.\nAnalysts say the government is determined to keep the economy expanding but is concerned about growing so quickly that the economy might crash before 2008, when Beijing is host to the Olympic Games, viewed as the ultimate coming-out party for China.\nOverinvestment in real estate and construction has been among the chief worries for the government. And for much of the last two years there have been frequent warnings and government measures to tame a wild property run.\nThe Central Bank said that last October, for the first time in five years, the bank savings of Chinese citizens decreased from the month before, presumably as more money went into the stock market. Credit Suisse estimated that more than $30 billion in bank deposits have flowed into mutual funds or direct plays into the stock market over the last six weeks.\nMany analysts say now that the bull run will continue in 2007, prompting even more money to flow into the market. One Chinese mutual fund raised $5 billion in a single day recently before closing its doors to new investors, an astonishing achievement here, according to some economists.\nIndustrial and Commercial Bank of China, which was publicly listed only last October, here in Shanghai and in Hong Kong, has already gained over 70 percent. This week, prices shot up again, before falling sharply Friday.\nThe run-up means companies in China can once again raise money in the Chinese market rather than relying on the Hong Kong stock market. But huge risks remain in a market that many analysts have long derided as a gambling den crowded with companies with suspect accounting.\nSeveral economists say that more increases are expected in the coming months, to tame the economy and the stock market.\nHong Liang, a Hong Kong-based economist at Goldman Sachs, said that the government had used the reserve ratio as a policy tool to help manage the economy but that it had not been very effective in cooling things down. She did not ''expect it to have much impact on the real economy or the financial markets.''\nLarge amounts of money flow into the country through foreign investments and surplus dollars from trade. China also has a high savings rate. So many people are looking to put that money to work -- in real estate, the stock market and even by investing in art and antiques.\n''A lot of hot money has entered the market, legally and otherwise,'' said Chang Chun, a professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, speaking of the stock market. ''In the past few years people were overpessimistic. Right now, they are overoptimistic and they're bringing a lot of money into the market.''
1816698	China Currency Near Parity With Hong Kong's Dollar	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03EED81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	For more than half a century, residents of Hong Kong have taken pride in being more prosperous than their cousins nearby in mainland China, and have enjoyed feeling like big spenders whenever they crossed the border.\nMerchants across the border in Shenzhen were happy to take Hong Kong dollars, pocketing the 6 percent premium it commanded over China's currency. Mainland tourists offering Chinese currency here were charged extra or even turned away and told to come back with Hong Kong dollars.\nBut the yuan is poised to become more valuable than the Hong Kong dollar by the end of the month, and could pass the traditional benchmark for the Hong Kong dollar's value as early as next week. The shift has been the latest in a series of shocks for residents' confidence that they or their ancestors had made the right decision to live in Hong Kong instead of anywhere else in China.\n''Nowadays, the gap between China and Hong Kong has narrowed, and some people even think the standard of living in China is higher,'' where prices are lower and incomes are rising quickly, recalled Chan Chi Him, the second generation of a family that has sold birds' nests as a delicacy here since the end of World War II.\n''It's easier for Chinese people to make money,'' he said.\nAverage incomes per person in cities like Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou remain a fifth or less of incomes for people in Hong Kong. But the averages in China are dragged down by very large numbers of very poor people.\nPeople in Hong Kong are used to comparing themselves with the educated middle class on the mainland. And they are finding that a growing class of Chinese businessmen and businesswomen have become more affluent than the average resident of Hong Kong.\nMillions of middle-class Chinese flock here every year, and shopkeepers are now happy to take Chinese currency, known as the yuan or renminbi.\nAt the same time, many shopkeepers across the border in China have stopped taking Hong Kong dollars or have begun asking a slightly greater number of dollars than the number of yuan on price tags would suggest.\nPrices are rising here in markets for everything from luxury apartments to dried bugs, and the culprit is the same: the rising value of the Chinese yuan and the falling value of the Hong Kong dollar.\nThe winning bid in a land auction last month worked out to more than $7,000 a square foot once houses are built, making Hong Kong real estate some of the most valuable in the world. Developers are betting that multinationals and mainlanders alike will continue to see Hong Kong as an excellent base for doing business in China.\nBut Hong Kong also imports much of its food and other goods from the mainland, and the prices are climbing.\nSellers of traditional Chinese medicine are having to pay more for the herbs, insects and other wares they buy from the mainland. The price of dried cicadas, which are boiled in soup to improve eyesight, has risen close to 4 percent in the last year as the yuan has gradually strengthened, said Lee Chun Hung, the chairman of Lee Hoong Kee Ltd., a Chinese medicine wholesaler.\nPrices have soared for herbs that are in demand across China, as increasingly affluent mainlanders have bid up prices to levels that many people in Hong Kong cannot afford. A rare root that is boiled in soup and eaten to strengthen the lungs now sells for $618 for a small box, four times its price two years ago.\n''It's not just the rise of the renminbi,'' Mr. Lee said, ''it's also because the standard of living is going up on the mainland.''\nWhile prices are starting to creep up here after years of deflation, rising home prices and falling unemployment have helped produce soaring confidence here in the territory's economic future, recent surveys have shown.\nThe yuan has been rising partly because of calls from the United States and Europe for the Chinese currency to reflect China's rising trade surplus and huge intake of foreign investment.\nChinese officials have also voiced concerns that maintaining a low value for the currency may eventually unleash inflation, although prices are barely rising now on the mainland.\nChina unified various exchange rates in 1994 and, after several years of gradual appreciation, fixed the exchange rate of the yuan at 8.28 to the dollar in 1998. Beijing officials maintained that level until July 2004. They then began allowing a slow appreciation, with the yuan climbing 3.4 percent last year. It was worth slightly more than 7.81 yuan to the dollar in Friday trading in Shanghai.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority pegged the Hong Kong dollar at 7.8 to the United States dollar in September 1983, and maintained that policy with few changes until June 2005. It then moved to a narrow trading band of 7.75 to 7.85 to the dollar.\nThe Hong Kong dollar has been trading near the top of that band lately, which is why it is likely that it will take a couple of more weeks for the yuan to reach parity.\nBen Simpfendorfer, a currency strategist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said that the yuan would surpass the Hong Kong dollar ''definitely before the end of the month.''\nWhile some speculators have raised the idea that the Hong Kong dollar might be repegged to the yuan, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been opposed, and most economists say that the move would be a bad idea. The weaker Hong Kong dollar improves Hong Kong's competitiveness relative to cities on the mainland, and a peg to the yuan would be difficult to maintain.\nThe yuan is not an internationally traded currency and the Chinese government backs it with a fairly inflexible monetary system in which the economy is controlled less by interest rate changes than by administrative measures, like an order on Friday that banks raise their reserves at the central bank to 9.5 percent of assets, from 9 percent.\nThe sometimes tumultuous violent history of currency policy in Hong Kong has also discouraged officials. When the Hong Kong dollar plunged in early September 1983, partly on uncertainty over what would happen to the territory after its return to Chinese rule in 1997, gasoline prices climbed because they were set in dollars and taxi drivers responded by holding a protest that turned violent; the Hong Kong dollar has been closely managed ever since.
1816699	Who Is Best at R&D?	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EED81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	TODAY'S quiz: What do Apple, Caterpillar, Google, Kellogg and Toyota have in common?\nAnswer: They are among the smartest companies when it comes to what they reap for their research and development dollars.\nThat was the conclusion of three Booz Allen Hamilton consultants -- Barry Jaruzelski, Kevin Dehoff and Rakesh Bordia -- after they reviewed the performances of the 1,000 publicly held companies worldwide that spent the most on R&D in 2005. They published the results in Strategy and Business.\nOver all, companies are becoming better at R&D, considering that spending increased $20 billion and revenue climbed even more. But the consultants classified only 94 concerns, including the 5 mentioned above, as ''high-leverage innovators.'' Those companies did better than their peers in seven performance measures, including sales growth, operating-income growth and total shareholder returns, over a five-year period, while spending ''less on R&D as a percentage of sales than their industry medians over the same five-year period.''\nWhile the best companies took different routes to maximizing R&D spending, the consultants said, one thing they shared was ''building multifunctional, companywide capabilities that can provide them with sustainable competitive advantage.''\nThis is the second year Booz Allen has conducted the study. ''Analysis of the 2005 Global Innovation 1,000 confirms the major finding from our initial study last year,'' the authors wrote. ''Money simply cannot buy effective innovation.''\nIn other words, spending a lot does not help you. Spending intelligently does.\nNEW TECH -- With breakthroughs seemingly coming every day, it is hard to keep up with all the developments in technology, even for those who earn a living with it.\nTo make your life easier, Alex Hutchinson in Popular Mechanics has created a cheat sheet titled ''10 Tech Concepts You Need to Know for 2007.'' Among them:\nPRAM. Phase-change random access memory is set to overtake flash memory in consumer electronics, the magazine contends, pointing out that it is 30 times as fast as flash memory ''with more than 10 times the life span.''\nVoN. ''The first Video on the Net conference was in 1998, but the concept of watching videos on your PC is only now reaching maturity.'' Apple is expected to introduce an ''iTV video-streaming box'' later this year.\nSmart pills. When swallowed, these vitamin-size sensors will transmit ''data about pressure, acidity and temperature to a 5-by-4-inch receiver that patients carry around with them during the pill's trip through their gastrointestinal tract.''\nData Clouds. The term given to the ability to gain access to every one of your files, ''from skimpy documents to gigabyte-hogging music,'' from any Internet connection. Versions of data clouds are available and the magazine expects the phenomenon will be widespread relatively soon.\nHAPPY NEW YEAR -- It looks as if it will be a good year -- at least in the market for yachts and business aircraft.\nShowBoats International reports the ''2007 Global Order Book for luxury yachts shows a total of 777 yachts 90 feet and larger under contract, totaling 94,404 linear feet.''\n''This represents a 15.3 percent increase in footage from 2006.''\nThings are equally good for the makers of business aircraft.\nReporting on a survey conducted by Honeywell of 1,400 flight departments, aircraft manufacturers and other sources, Flying writes record worldwide deliveries are projected for 2006 and 2007, ''and the bull market for business jets is going to keep rolling along.'' During the survey period, 2006 to 2016, Honeywell expects some 12,000 aircraft worth $195 billion to be added.\nFINAL TAKE -- If six days into the new year you have already given up on that resolution to lose weight, here is something to ponder, courtesy of Mikhail Sedov in Fortune Small Business.\n''Vacuuming fat from more than 455,000 patients -- and some $1.2 billion out of their wallets -- made liposuction the No. 1 cosmetic-surgery procedure in the U.S. in 2005.''\nThat is certainly one way to meet your goal.\nPAUL B.

Those hopes faded somewhat last month when Representative Howard L. Berman was named chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the Internet and intellectual property.\nPutting Mr. Berman in charge of the panel, diminishes the chances for ''real reform'' of copyright policy, Lawrence Lessig, perhaps the best-known authority on the legal issues surrounding intellectual property and the Internet, wrote last week on his blog (lessig.org). Change is needed, he wrote, ''to fit the legitimate objectives of copyright -- to assure that artists have the incentives they need to create great new work -- into the contours of digital technology.''\nMr. Berman, though widely regarded as a smart and savvy politician, is a favorite boogeyman of advocates for copyright reform, many of whom say he is in the pocket of his Hollywood constituents (he actually represents the San Fernando Valley, but many media industry figures live there).\nIn 2002, he introduced a bill that would have allowed media companies to hack into peer-to-peer networks to ''disrupt'' or ''impair'' illicit file trading. The proposed law would have limited the liability of copyright owners to $50 ''per impairment to the property of the affected file trader.''\nCritics said the measure, which never got out of committee, would have essentially allowed copyright holders to destroy people's computers with near impunity. Mr. Berman labeled the loudest criticism as ''hysteria,'' and insisted his bill included adequate limitations and consumer protections.\nPutting Mr. Berman in charge of the copyright committee ''is like making a congressman from Detroit head of an automobile safety subcommittee, or a senator from Texas head of a global warming subcommittee,'' Mr. Lessig wrote.\nNO. 1 WITH A BULLET -- Hitwise, which tracks online traffic trends, reported this week that use of iTunes was up 413 percent on Christmas Day compared with the previous year, beating Microsoft's new Zune service by 30 to 1 (informationweek.com).\nTraffic was brisk at Zune, too, though, up 1,030 percent over the previous Monday. Traffic on iTunes was up 1,222 percent during the same period. The increase, of course, came mostly from people who received iPods as gifts. The Apple Store section of iTunes showed an increase in traffic of 110 percent over the previous Christmas. Traffic was so heavy, that customers were complaining about slowdowns and error messages.\nELECTRIC JUNK -- What should be done with those old iPods and other electronics once they've outlived their usefulness? That's not an easy question, thanks to all the toxic chemicals they contain, notes the Web site of Technology Review magazine (technologyreview.com).\nMany companies (including Apple) will take back products, and some states force them to, but it's not always easy to tell which companies accept returns for recycling, or how well they'll handle the task if they do.\nEnter the Computer Takeback Campaign, which offers a company-by-company guide (www.computertakeback.com).\nWhile some companies do a good job, ''the majority of recyclers are not responsible recyclers,'' Robin Schneider, a member of the group, told Technology Review. In many countries ''recycled'' electronics end up polluting the land, air and water with mercury, cadmium and other nasty stuff.\nThe electronics industry offers its own online guide at ecyclingcentral.com.\nLOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP -- According to AppleInsider, more than two million Macs were sold this holiday season (appleinsider.com). Converts from Windows will spend much of January getting used to their new machines -- and it's not always as easy as Apple would have you believe.

1816701	How I Spent My Summer Vacation: Now a Major Motionless Book	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEED81430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	I COME from a family that has a somewhat odd relationship with technology. My father, for instance, refused to give up his manual typewriter when newfangled electric typewriters came onto the market. But now his computer system has more bells and whistles than mine.\nWhile I'm no Luddite, neither am I exactly cutting-edge. That is why, as with many people who have made the switch to a digital camera over the last several years, I have been somewhat at a loss over what to do with the images.\nMy inclination has been to treat them like a digital version of film: simply print them out and stick them in a photo album. A few years ago, we bought a pint-size printer dock that prints one photo at a time.\nIt's fairly time-consuming and not very cost-efficient, once paper and ink are taken into consideration, but I like printing the occasional photo. Most of the digitized images, however, first sat in the camera and then on our computer.\nBy contrast, my brother-in-law, Tim, used a Web photo site to send online photo albums, as well as a printed version of one he made for my parents of a family reunion.\nA year later, I was ready to try it myself and went to Shutterfly.com, a site Tim used, and took the plunge.\nI was surprised how easy it was; this was a case where the Web site really did walk me through the process step by step.\nOnce I uploaded the photos from my computer -- a simple and quick task that is similar on almost every photo site -- I was given a choice of album size; cover (cloth, satin, suede or leather); page background; borders; print font for captions; and layout.\nHey, this was fun!\nUntil I accidentally deleted the last few pages. And had to rearrange the photos yet again. I directed a few choice words at the computer.\nBut the process was surprisingly straightforward. And when the album arrived, I was delighted. At a cost of about $35, including shipping for a 26-page book, it looked sleek and colorful, with our vacation tidily tucked between its blue covers. And it impressed my (apparently easily impressed) friends to no end.\nPrinted on archival paper, it should last at least 70 years before fading; long after, I'm sure, the entire vacation is wiped from my memory.\nBecause I had simply fallen into Shutterfly, however, I decided I should see what the many other online sites have to offer.\nThere are dozens to choose from for use with both PCs and Macs. Some of the more popular are: dotphoto.com, flickr.com, kodakgallery.com, mpix.com, photoworks.com, phanfare.com, picasa.google.com, smugmug.com, Snapfish.com and winkflash.com\nFor Mac users, there is also iPhoto, which is part of its iLife '06 package. IPhoto costs $79 for an individual plan and $99 for a family plan, which installs on up to five Macs. It allows Mac users to do much of what can be done on online photo sites, as well as store up to 250,000 digital photos.\nEach photo site has specialties: some cater more to professionals; some to amateurs; some charge an annual fee; some offer services, like free storage, but are loaded with advertisements.\nBut side-by-side comparisons are difficult because perks are constantly changing.\n''Every time one brings out one feature, the others have to respond,'' said Ted Fisher, digital adviser at the New York Institute of Photography. ''They seem to keep leapfrogging each other.''\nFor instance, Mr. Fisher said, one site may allow you to do some photo cropping online, then others will follow suit. One will offer a huge amount of free storage for photos; another will counter with unlimited space.\n''There's a lot of pressure to build up a big client base, then push for a subscription,'' he said.\nLinda Roeder, who researches personal Web sites for About.com (which is owned by The New York Times Company), said there are key features to look for when shopping for an online store.\nKnow your site's storage and deletion policies. ''Make sure you read the fine print, otherwise you might have your photos deleted,'' she said.\nGood idea. I had no clue what the policy was on Shutterfly, so I went to the Frequently Asked Questions page.\nIt has no maximum storage amount, although it urges customers to keep image file sizes to less than 10 megabytes. It also promises not to delete the photos, although it ''reserves the right to modify the policy if necessary.''\nKodakgallery, on the other hand, which Ms. Roeder said she used, also provides free unlimited storage, but will keep your images only as long as you make a purchase once every 12 months.\nThat means you can buy a single print to reactivate your account, which keeps it running for another 12 months. But you have to remember to do it.\nSome people don't realize their photos can be deleted, and Ms. Roeder said she had a batch of photos disappear before she caught on to the policy.\n''I'm not the only one,'' she said. ''A lot of people have contacted me. One woman said her wedding photos were deleted.''\nWhich leads us to backup.\nSee if your site offers backup DVDs. For example, they are available at smugmug.com, a site that wins high praise, but unlike many, charges, starting at $39.95 annually.\nAgain, checking back with Shutterfly, after a little hunting around and, finally a call to the help line, it turns out it sells what it calls archive CDs, which are backups, starting at $9.99 for 1 to 50 photos up to $39.99 for 201 to 1,000 photos.\nAnd, of course, you can also burn your own CD.\nIf you are e-mailing photo albums online, you might want to check out such features as how long a description you can write of each photo. Ms. Roeder said she liked Kodakgallery because it allowed her to write in-depth captions, so ''it's like writing a blog, and when you flip through the photos, it's like reading a story.''\nIf you are going to order a huge number of prints, it is a good idea to first buy a few to inspect the quality. Ms. Roeder said she bought a few from one site that were grainy and off-center.\nPopular Photography and Imaging magazine urges wariness when ordering prints larger than 8 by 10; only 3 of the 10 sites reviewed in its May 2006 issue did an ''outstanding job'' with posters at 16 inches by 20 inches.\nSecurity is another big concern, and most sites now ensure that your photos can be password-protected if you want only friends and family to see your latest vacation antics.\nSome sites, however, cater to public viewing. Flickr.com, for example, not only offers the usual storage and sorting of photos, but provides an online community where people can share their favorite photos of, say, flowers, or San Francisco or Halloween.\nThis social aspect will be the next big leap in photography, Mr. Fisher predicted.\n''A lot of people are right now pulling cameras out of their boxes that they got for the holidays,'' he said. ''They're the wave of people right in the middle of the crowd. They've now accepted digital as a valuable thing. I think for many it will develop as their hobby or social interest as music once was -- as their creative outlet.''\nWhile I have never been an arts and crafts sort of person, I do know this is something I'm finding fun -- and solving several problems at once. Organization. Gifts. Saving money. (Once you take into account what it used to cost to print and buy albums, the digital alternatives are comparable, while posting slide shows and sending online albums are often free.)\nI took pictures at a friend's 50th-birthday party and presented her with a satin-covered photo book to commemorate the event.\nAs we speak, duplicate albums of my parents' 50th wedding anniversary celebration are winging their way to various family members.\nAnd why stop at recent past events? For Hanukkah, my neighbor received from his sister a hard-copy book of photographs of his 1969 bar mitzvah that she had made from slides. You can scan the photos or slides yourself and create a book with the right software or send them to sites like blurb.com or digmypics.com that will do it for you\nThat sent me looking back at photos from my distant past. Graduations, birthdays -- and my ancient prom photo in a midnight blue dress.\nWell, maybe some pictures deserve to fade into oblivion.\nSHORTCUTS E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com
1816702	Either Victory Song Will Please Steinbrenner	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E7D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, has not had a World Series champion since 2000, but he will back a winner in Monday's title game of the Bowl Championship Series between Ohio State and Florida.\nIn a sense, Steinbrenner is calling the tune.\nHe lives in Florida but grew up in Ohio. He likes football, and he enjoys the music of marching bands. So Steinbrenner and his wife, Joan, have donated large but unspecified amounts of money for construction of marching band facilities on the campuses of both universities.\nThe Joan Zieg Steinbrenner Band Center in Columbus, Ohio, is named for Steinbrenner's wife, a graduate of Ohio State. The George M. Steinbrenner Band Building is under construction in Gainesville, Fla.\nHoward Rubenstein, Steinbrenner's New York-based spokesman, would not disclose the amount of Steinbrenner's donations, although it has been reported that each donation was more than $1 million. Rubenstein said the two universities have been the only recipients of Steinbrenner's philanthropy toward college band facilities.\n''I'm a dedicated fan of football and the band plays an enormous role in enhancing the spirit and excitement of football whenever they march and play,'' Steinbrenner said in a statement relayed by Rubenstein, who said he spoke yesterday by telephone with Steinbrenner. ''It's wonderful for the sport.''\nRubenstein said that Steinbrenner would not attend the championship game Monday.\nDavid Waybright, director of bands at Florida, said that the university's building would eventually cost $9.3 million, and it should be finished by the spring of 2008. The Ohio State band building is part of Ohio Stadium, which was renovated earlier this decade.\nWaybright said he understood that Steinbrenner would root for Ohio State to defeat Florida but added: ''This game is a win-win for him. He likes bands. He's quietly philanthropic. It speaks volumes to me.''\nSteinbrenner, Rubenstein said, is a friend of Jon R. Woods, director of the Ohio State band, and that ''Dr. Woods was instrumental in suggesting that George contribute something to Florida.''\nWaybright said he learned of the donation after Steinbrenner attended a game at Florida and told university officials, ''I want to do something nice for the band.''
1816703	Reunion Of Meyer And Smith Succeeds	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E7D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	When Florida Coach Urban Meyer scored his biggest recruiting victory last summer, it was not achieved by beating out Miami, Florida State or Tennessee.\nMeyer and his staff managed to lure cornerback Ryan Smith, the team's most important newcomer, before he transferred to Howard University, a Division I-AA program.\n''I think it saved our season,'' Meyer said. ''He's that valuable to us.''\nSmith played for Meyer at Utah in 2004 and earned freshman all-American honors. Meyer left for Florida in 2005, and then Smith clashed with his new position coach. Smith lost his starting job, and by spring practice he had become so frustrated he quit the team.\nBecause of an obscure new N.C.A.A. transfer rule that Meyer emphatically opposes, Smith was able to transfer to Florida late last summer. So instead of playing for Howard, Smith will line up across from Ted Ginn Jr. or Anthony Gonzalez on Monday night when the Gators face Ohio State in the Bowl Championship Series title game.\n''Everything has been moving so fast I haven't had a chance to really think about everything,'' Smith said. ''It's been crazy.''\nThe rule that Smith took advantage of allows athletes who graduate from a university to transfer to another without losing a season of eligibility. Meyer does not like it because it brings an element of free agency to college sports.\nBut he is not complaining about the results. Smith's transfer allowed the Gators to let Reggie Nelson play his natural position, safety. Nelson earned first-team all-American honors there, and Meyer called him the team's best player. But Nelson would have probably been forced to play cornerback because the starter Dee Webb entered the N.F.L. draft last spring and Avery Atkins, another starter, was released from the team after a domestic dispute with his girlfriend.\nBut Smith arrived and exceeded all expectations. His eight interceptions and seven pass breakups helped him earn third-team all-American honors and first-team all-Southeastern Conference.\n''With him at Utah, I had a great year and he knew the type of person that I was,'' Smith said of Meyer. ''I wouldn't have come here if I didn't think I could run with these guys.''\nStill, it was not easy for Smith to get here. He had to earn 21 credits last summer to receive his sociology degree from Utah. He said he took six classes at one time, barely passing a social statistics course.\n''I basically got here by two grade points,'' he said.\nOnce he arrived, Smith had an advantage because the schemes the Gators ran were similar to those at Utah. His biggest challenge was to convince his teammates that a player who struggled the previous season at Utah could start for the Gators.\nGreg Mattison, a co-defensive coordinator for Florida, said Smith earned everyone's respect the first day of practice when he blanketed the star receiver Dallas Baker in a one-on-one drill.\n''Everyone came into the locker room after and said, 'Boy, this guy is really good,' '' Mattison recalled. ''He fit in perfectly right away.''\nAfter rising from obscurity to all-American status, all that is left for Smith is a perfect ending to this season in the national title game.\nCOLLEGES
1816704	Dow's Dogs Still Having Their Day	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E7D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	EVERY dog has its day, but the Dogs of the Dow have had their day for seven years. During that span, the Dogs -- the 10 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average with the highest dividend yields at the end of each year -- have handily outperformed the index itself and other benchmarks of blue-chip stocks.\nOwning the 10 Dogs in equal dollar amounts would have produced an annualized total return, share price appreciation plus dividends, of 5.5 percent since 1999, according to Dow Jones & Company. The complete 30-stock index could manage only 3.3 percent.\nThe Dogs of the Dow are the sort of stocks that value investors covet. Despite the unflattering appellation, the Dogs are solid, long-established businesses that are selling at bargain prices and producing enough cash flow to have high dividend yields.\n''These are companies that have been around for years,'' said James Huguet, president of Great Companies Funds, a Florida portfolio manager specializing in shares of large American businesses. ''You're buying them at a discount, and they're paying dividends, so it takes some of the risk out.''\nThe Dogs for 2007, in descending order of yield, are Verizon, Altria, AT&T, Pfizer, Citigroup, Merck, General Motors, Dupont, J. P. Morgan and General Electric.\nA refinement of the strategy is to buy just the five Dogs with the lowest share prices at the end of each year. Doing so would have raised the performance of a Dogs portfolio over the last seven years to an annualized return of 7.3 percent. The five lowest-priced Dogs for 2007, beginning with the cheapest, are Pfizer, G.M., AT&T, G.E. and Verizon.\nMany Dow Dogs, now or in any year, have something in common besides longevity and low valuations. They are flawed in some way, which is why they are cheap in the first place.\n''These are companies that are in temporary trouble,'' said Pat Dorsey, research director at Morningstar. ''That is what the strategy is supposed to highlight. Sometimes they bounce back after a rough patch, sometimes management gains some I.Q. points, and sometimes it gets booted out.'' (A high yield can signal trouble because it sometimes results from a decline in the share price rather than an increase in the dividend.)\nMr. Huguet focused on the third possibility. Many of the companies that attain Dog status have been taken down the wrong path, he said. Share prices sink, forcing changes at the helm. The new broom begins sweeping around the time that the stocks would be added to a Dogs portfolio.\n''A lot of the time when Dogs of the Dow that have been downtrodden suddenly come alive, it's because you have new management in there,'' he said. ''Earnings turn around, and because the stock is depressed, it can have a huge effect on the price.''\nMr. Huguet prefers to own fast growers rather than potential turnaround plays, so he is not a fan of the Dogs strategy. He does own a couple from this year's crop, though: Citigroup and J. P. Morgan.\nWalter McCormick, lead manager of the Evergreen Fundamental Large Cap fund, also likes the two banks, along with the drug maker Pfizer and the food and tobacco producer Altria.\nTHIS year may be an especially good one for the Dogs, Mr. McCormick said. After the strong run turned in by many species of Dow stocks over the last few years, returns for the Dow industrial index may diminish, encouraging investors to put a premium on stocks with high dividend yields, he explained. ''You'll want the wind at your back,'' he said. ''If we have a year when returns are in the high single digits, you're halfway there with high-yielding stocks.''\nMr. Dorsey, at Morningstar, has mixed feelings about the Dogs. He, too, likes Citigroup, J. P. Morgan and Altria, calling them ''reasonably cheap.'' On the other hand, he considers G.M. and AT&T ''ridiculously overvalued.''\nHe is shunning Merck, which is fending off lawsuits over its painkiller Vioxx, and has had good results in court, but not where it counts, he said. ''Merck has a terrible pipeline'' of new drugs, he said. ''That's what makes drug companies go.''\nAll in all, Mr. Dorsey finds the 2007 Dogs to be ''not a very inspiring group.'' Even so, he approves of the strategy because it may help to teach old investors a new trick.\n''You're buying solid companies when they're down on their luck,'' he said. ''That's better than buying whatever was hot last year, as many investors do.''\nMARKET VALUES
1816705	Abroad at Home	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Like many illegal immigrants, Javier Huete did not dare plan a trip home for the holidays for fear he would not be able to re-enter the United States. But he was able to see his mother, in-laws and cousins in Honduras anyway thanks to videoconferencing services provided at an Order Express storefront in Houston.\nA check-cashing and money-transfer company based in Michoacán, Mexico, Order Express has been offering videoconferencing at a dozen of its 300 locations throughout the United States and Latin America.\nMr. Huete, a delivery truck driver, said in Spanish, ''I talk to my family on the phone all the time, but with this they can see the children.''\nDuring the 40-minute videoconference with a dozen of his relatives assembled at an Order Express in Honduras, Mr. Huete's infant daughter squirmed in his lap and his 4-year-old daughter stood with her nose nearly touching a 60-inch flat-screen TV on which the image of her teary-eyed grandmother cooed ''Qué bonita!'' or ''How beautiful!'' Normally, a half-hour visit costs $40, but he got an extra 10 minutes because there was trouble hooking him up initially.\nBecause of stricter border enforcement since 9/11, increased broadband access and reduced cost of video equipment, more businesses are offering videoconferencing services to reunite immigrants with their families back home. Typically found in or near places immigrants frequent like money-transfer operations or consular offices, these kinds of services are often reserved for weeks in advance. ''I'm booked Dec. 20 through Jan. 1,'' said Ivan Fernando Rojas, owner of a small videoconferencing business in Bay Shore, N.Y., called A Tu Alcance, which means Reach Out.\nSuch businesses are often run by immigrants like Mr. Rojas who is from Colombia: ''I know how it feels being in a country without your family.'' He started A Tu Alcance in 2004 with money he saved from cleaning office buildings: ''I got the idea 12 years ago when I was dusting videoconference equipment in an office.'' But back then, the technology cost $10,000 to $20,000. Today, a complete videoconference setup costs as little as $2,000, according to Laura Shay, director for marketing at Polycom, a leading brand.\nWhile no one keeps track of the number of videoconferencing businesses marketing their services to immigrants, sales representatives at companies like Polycom report increased inquiries and purchases for the applications. ''This was not a successful business model until recently because now you have both the affordability of the equipment as well as the wider availability of Internet cable connections which you need to have on both sides, here and there,'' said Charlie Macli, senior vice president for sales and marketing at IVCi, a provider of video communications and network services in Hauppauge, N.Y.\nThough most videoconferencing businesses tend to be small single-shop operations, a company called AmigoLatino has locations in eight cities with large Hispanic immigrant communities including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami. It also has affiliate offices in eight Latin American countries as well as in Spain. Moreover, AmigoLatino oversees videoconferencing operations at Order Express shops like the one in Houston where Mr. Huete linked up with his family in Honduras.\nFounded in 2002 by Gabriel Biguria and a small group of private investors, AmigoLatino caters mostly to Spanish-speaking immigrants. ''It would work equally well for immigrants from Asia or Africa but the time difference would be a challenge,'' said Mr. Biguria, who is from Guatemala but holds an M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He formerly worked in marketing and sales for Hewlett-Packard and several Silicon Valley start-ups.\n''There's incredibly high demand for this kind of service,'' particularly given Hispanic culture's traditional emphasis on family togetherness, said Raúl Hinojosa-Ojeda, professor for international development and Chicano and Chicana studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. His mobile banking services company, No Borders, offered videoconferencing between sites in the United States and Latin America for two years before it spun off that part of the business in 2005 to a concern in Pueblo, Mexico, called Creative Networks.\nCreative Networks links personal computers at a dozen affiliates in the United States to a Latin American network of Internet cafes with broadband access, Mr. Hinojosa-Ojeda said. The owner of Creative Networks, Sergio Garnelo, could not be reached for comment.\nHispanic immigrants typically do not have computers at home much less have the kind of high-end computers and broadband access necessary for clear live video transmission and reception.\n''The way most PCs allocate power to images is less than what you need to get really good quality,'' said Elliot Gold, president of Telespan, a company that provides market analysis of the teleconferencing and videoconferencing industry. ''The image gets really grainy when you blow it up on a large screen.'' Specialized videoconferencing equipment, he said, is usually best to get an experience that ''the other person is in the room with you.''\nAnd that is what homesick immigrants like Mr. Huete in Houston want. ''It's good to feel as if the family is in the same place,'' he said. Many times, immigrants set up a videoconference to mark a special occasion. For example, Mr. Rojas in Bay Shore said families in two countries assemble before video screens to celebrate birthdays, engagements and 50th wedding anniversaries. They sit around, talk, eat cake and drink wine. One customer recently scheduled a videoconference to show her mother in El Salvador the gown she was going wear at her wedding. ''I cry 9 times out of 10,'' Mr. Rojas said.\nThe cost of these kinds of virtual reunions ranges from $80 to $120 an hour depending on the Latin American country. This is far less than at places like FedEx Kinkos, which charges $265 to $350 and requires the party in Latin America to provide its own equipment since the chain, which offers business services, does not have locations there.\nWhile still expensive for many immigrants, most say the service is worth it. ''I was able to see my auntie and uncle,'' said Blanca Leticia Pineda de Juarez, a nanny in Los Angeles who left Guatemala 15 years ago. She had not seen them since then and she was able to introduce them to her infant daughter recently during a videoconference at AmigoLatino's Los Angeles office.\n''It made me feel so good,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''I'm definitely going to do it again.''\nPERSONAL BUSINESS

1816707	A Giant Receives a Second Chance, Twice	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E6D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	There was a palpable sense of calm in the Giants' locker room during the week as the Giants prepared to play the Philadelphia Eagles, a reflection of the second chance that the team received by making the playoffs. And nobody knows the meaning of second chances better than Grey Ruegamer.\nThat is not only because Ruegamer, a 30-year-old backup offensive lineman, knows what a playoff berth can be worth. He is the only player on the roster with a Super Bowl ring, from a stint with the New England Patriots.\nIt is also because of what happened to Ruegamer two Saturdays ago on an early morning drive to Giants Stadium. He walked away from a single-car accident that left his pickup truck totaled.\nA little before 7 a.m., the day before the Giants played host to the New Orleans Saints, Ruegamer guided his 2004 Dodge Ram pickup around the bend that leads from Interstate 495, west from the Lincoln Tunnel, to Route 3 toward the Meadowlands.\nHis truck fishtailed one way on the rain-slicked road, then the other. The truck smacked the curb, rolled twice and came to rest on the driver's side on a pile of boulders.\nRuegamer was wearing a seat belt. He said he remembered tumbling in slow motion and all the loose debris in the cab of the truck -- shoes and water bottles, mostly -- bouncing around him.\n''It was like being inside one of those Lotto-ball things,'' he said, viewing the episode with humor and relief.\nHanging sideways in the driver's seat, Ruegamer saw a man approach. In what Ruegamer -- born in Arizona, raised in Las Vegas and living in the off-season outside Los Angeles -- called a ''great Jersey moment,'' the man swore at him, then asked if he was O.K.\nRuegamer was O.K., and he climbed out through the passenger-side door. The worst of his bumps and bruises, a red welt high on his shin, is still visible.\nHe was sore, but he played against the Saints. Last week, because of injuries and the benching of tackle Bob Whitfield, Ruegamer started at left guard against the Washington Redskins.\nHe left the game after the second series because of a deep cut from a cleat on his shin, just below the welt. He was patched up, then returned to help running back Tiki Barber gain a franchise-record 234 yards rushing.\nBut there was an oddity that was not lost on Ruegamer or his teammates. They have chided him for being able to walk away from a potentially serious car accident, but leaving his first start of the season because someone stepped on him.\nRuegamer, in a rental car, still drives by the scene of the accident -- more slowly now, he said. He can see part of his truck bed lying on the rocks, a macabre memorial to good fortune.\nIt is a daily reminder to appreciate second chances. Only one of the Giants knows how rich the prize is at the end of the playoffs, and how helpless the feeling is when life takes a tumble.\nPRO FOOTBALL
1816708	Mr. Ford Gets the Last Laugh	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE6D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	IN recent days, I've been bombarded by requests to comment on my relationship with President Gerald Ford. Until now, I've tried to say nothing -- any remarks from me during the Ford family's private time of grief would have been inappropriate.\nThe requests were understandable, I guess. You see, I made a reputation for myself 30 years ago on ''Saturday Night Live'' in part because of a number of sketches and ''Weekend Updates'' that I wrote or appeared in ridiculing Mr. Ford for his apparent ''stumble-bumbling'' (though he was perhaps the best athlete to have been president) and making fun of his presidency.\nLuckily for me, Mr. Ford had a sense of humor.\nI've often thought how odd it was that we became linked together. It's not like we had a lot in common. After all, Mr. Ford had never been helped for any problems with ''self-medication'' in a facility that has helped so many throughout these past decades. And he had never been castigated by the press for such atrocities as ''Oh! Heavenly Dog'' or ''Cops and Robbersons,'' among other slightly awful films I had made in Hollywood.\nBut linked together we were. And not just in the obvious ways. If it hadn't been for the courage of Mr. Ford's wife, Betty, for admitting to an alcohol problem, I would never have received the help I needed in the early 1980s at the Betty Ford clinic, located not far from the Ford residence near Palm Springs. During my short stay there, I often saw Mrs. Ford personally surveying the clinic and generously offering a helping hand to those who were lucky enough to face their problems and, with the learned help of the clinic staff, appraise their behavior and their lifestyles.\nOne day when my wife, Jayni, came to visit me at the clinic, the Fords invited us to lunch. As it happened, Mrs. Ford had become so beloved and respected by many for her earlier openness about breast cancer and her alcoholism that a television network was in preproduction on a special bio-pic about her. Mr. Ford suggested that while we ate lunch, the four of us could view the videotape of various performances by actors being considered to play the part of the president.\nSeated at a small table set for four in a simple dining room also containing a somewhat complicated videotape recorder and TV set were the former commander in chief and I making friendly small talk before lunch was brought in. And on all fours, literally on their hands and knees in front of the bulky and confusing tape machine, were Mrs. Ford and Jayni trying their best to figure out the wiring of the playback machine and the way the whole system worked, so we could watch the screen tests. Noting the effort the ladies were putting into getting the VCR to work, I suggested to Mr. Ford that perhaps we might help them out.\nAs I began to stand up from my chair, he took gentle hold of my arm, sat me back down and said: ''No, no, Chevy. Don't even think about it. I'll probably get electrocuted, and you'll be picked up and arrested for murder.''\nWe both laughed.\nI'll never forget that moment. My laughter was hearty and genuine.\nOp-Ed Contributor Chevy Chase is an actor and a writer.
1816709	Monkey On A Tiger	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE6D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	There was a touch of parody to the giddy Democrat takeover this week: Nancy Pelosi indulging her inner Haight-Ashbury and dipping the Capitol in tie-dye, sashaying around with the Grateful Dead, Wyclef Jean, Carole King, Richard Gere, feminists and a swarm of well-connected urchins.\nThe first act of House Democrats who promised to govern with bipartisan comity was imperiously banishing Republicans from participating in the initial round of lawmaking. Even if Republicans were brutes during their reign, Democrats should have shown more class, letting the whiny minority party offer some stupid amendments that would lose.\nPerhaps the Democrats' power-shift into overdrive is a neurological disorder, or neuropolitical disorder.\nIf free will is an illusion -- if we are, as one philosopher put it, ''nothing more than sophisticated meat machines,'' doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over -- that would explain a lot about the latest trend in which everyone is reverting to type.\nWilliam James wrote in 1890 that the whole ''sting and excitement'' of life comes from ''our sense that in it things are really being decided from one moment to another, and that it is not the dull rattling off of a chain that was forged innumerable ages ago.''\nBut in Science Times this week, Dennis Overbye advised Dr. James to ''get over it,'' observing that ''a bevy of experiments in recent years suggest that the conscious mind is like a monkey riding a tiger of subconscious decisions and actions in progress, frantically making up stories about being in control.''\nAs Mark Hallett of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke told Mr. Overbye, ''Free will does exist, but it's a perception, not a power or a driving force. The more you scrutinize it, the more you realize you don't have it.''\nThat would explain why, after voters insisted that the president wrap it up in Iraq, he made a big show of pretending to listen, then decided to do a war do-over.\nIs this just the baked-in stubbornness of one man, or is W.'s behavior evidence that he has no free will? Is the Decider freely choosing another huge blunder or is he taking instructions from his genetic and political coding, fearing that if he admits what a foul hash he's made of Iraq, he'll be labeled a wimp, as his dad was?\nIf W. is trapped on a tiger, he's not the only one.\nJohn McCain can't get beyond seeing himself as a maverick now that he's become a nonmaverick, a right-wing Republican urging an escalation of a hopeless war, even though he's already lived through an escalation of a hopeless war.\n''There are two keys to any surge in U.S. troops,'' Senator McCain told an appreciative audience at the American Enterprise Institute yesterday. ''It must be substantial, and it must be sustained.''\nWith the letter she and Harry Reid wrote to the president yesterday, warning him that ''we are well past the point of more troops for Iraq,'' Speaker Pelosi tried to exert her free will to stop the Surge. But the Democrats aren't willing to take real action and cut off money for the Surge. They're predetermined to want to have it both ways: not to be blamed for the war and not to be blamed for pulling the plug on the war.\nIraq has become a snake pit of factions failing to escape fate. Shiites and Sunnis have been fighting and killing each other for about 1,400 years over who was the rightful heir to Muhammad, and yet the entire American high command was somehow taken aback that Shiites and Sunnis can't muster the free will to keep their country from disintegrating.\nCould it have been kismet that there were Shiites taunting Saddam at his hanging? Maybe it was preordained back in the days when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone and the British diplomat Gertrude Bell drew the boundaries of the modern Iraq that a security guy with a cellphone would capture the spectacle.\nDespite all the talk back in the 2000 campaign about a robustly experienced foreign-policy dream team, it may have been destined that the Bush administration would be asleep in the run-up to the insurgency, just as it was asleep in the run-up to 9/11, to Katrina, to the occupation and to the refugee crisis in Iraq. Either all that was predetermined, or the administration was preternaturally negligent.\nArthur Schopenhauer, the German philosopher who said a man can do what he wants but cannot will what he wants, would have understood W.'s nonsensical urge to Surge.\nWe don't know if human beings have free will. We just know that human beings in Washington appear not to.\nOp-Ed Columnist
1816710	The Vanishing Man of the Forest	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E5D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	ONCE again, I am driving, under the blazing equatorial sun, down an uncomfortable, rutty relic of a road into the interior of central Borneo. With me are two uniformed police men, one armed with a machine gun. The landscape is bleak, no trees, no shade as far as the eye can see. Our mission is to confiscate orangutan orphans whose mothers have been killed as a result of the sweeping forest clearance taking place throughout Borneo.\nMany years ago, Louis Leakey, the great paleo-anthropologist whose work at Olduvai Gorge and other sites in East Africa revolutionized our knowledge of human origins, encouraged me to study wild orangutans -- just as he had encouraged Jane Goodall to study chimpanzees and Dian Fossey to study gorillas. Later, he laughingly called us the ''trimates,'' or the three primates.\nOrangutans are not as well known as chimpanzees and gorillas. But like their African cousins, orangutans are great apes, our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom, and the most intelligent animals, with the exception of humans, to have evolved on land. Orangutans are reclusive, semi-solitary, quiet, highly arboreal and red, facts that come as a surprise to some people. Their name is derived from the Malay words ''orang hutan,'' which literally mean ''person of the forest.'' And it is the orangutan's profound connection to the forest that is driving it to extinction.\nWithout forests, orangutans cannot survive. They spend more than 95 percent of their time in the trees, which, along with vines and termites, provide more than 99 percent of their food. Two forests form their only habitat, and they are the tropical rain forests of Borneo and Sumatra.\nSumatra is exclusively Indonesian, as is the two thirds of the island of Borneo known as Kalimantan. That places 80 to 90 percent of the orangutan population, which numbers only 40,000 to 50,000, in Indonesia, with the remainder in Malaysian Borneo. What happens in Indonesia, particularly Kalimantan, will determine the orangutan's future.\nWhen I first arrived in Central Kalimantan in 1971, orangutans were already endangered because of poaching (for the pet trade and for the cooking pot) and deforestation (by loggers and by villagers making way for gardens and rice fields).\nBut it was all relatively small-time. The forests of Kalimantan were vast -- Indonesia's are the second largest tropical rain forests in the world, after Brazil's -- and forest conversion rates small. People still used axes and saws to cut down trees and traveled by dugout canoes or small boats with inboard engines.\nI went straight to work, beginning a wild orangutan study that continues to this day, and establishing an orangutan rehabilitation program, the first in Kalimantan, which has returned more than 300 ex-captive orangutans to the wild.\nBut the wild is increasingly difficult to find. In the late 1980s, as it entered the global economy, Indonesia decided to become a major producer and exporter of palm oil, pulp and paper. Before this, the government had endorsed selective logging. Now vast areas of forest were slated for conversion to plantations to grow trees for palm oil and paper production. Monster-sized bulldozers, replacing the chain saws of the early logging boom, tore up the forest, clear-cutting as many as 250,000 acres at once for palm oil plantations.\nAt the same time, the price of wood, particularly the valuable hardwoods that grow in Indonesia's rain forests and fetch a high price on the black market, increased. Illegal logging became rampant, even in national parks and reserves.\nWhile illegal logging degrades the forest, plantations absolutely destroy it. And the destruction is not only immediate, but also long-term. Forest-clearing leaves huge amounts of dry branches and other wood litter on forest floors; a small spark can ignite enormous forest fires, particularly in times of drought. During the 1997 El Niño drought, approximately 25 million acres, an area about half the size of Oklahoma, burned in Indonesia. Thousands of orangutans died.\nIndonesia has achieved its goal of becoming one of the two largest palm-oil producers and exporters in the world. But at what cost? At least half of the world's wild orangutans have disappeared in the last 20 years; biologically viable populations of orangutans have been radically reduced in size and number; and 80 percent of the orangutan habitat has either been depopulated or totally destroyed. The trend shows no sign of abating: government maps of future planned land use show more of the same, on an increasing scale.\nWe're back in the jeep. The police view the trip inland as a success. They confiscated five orangutans and one woman volunteered her crab-eating macaque, an unprotected species. Two of the orangutan owners, both women, shed tears, but we invited them to visit their ''pets'' at the Orangutan Foundation International's Care Center and Quarantine, where they will be rehabilitated and eventually released to the wild.\nI am pleased to think that five more orphan orangutans will once again feel the branches and leaves under their feet as they swing through the trees. Yet I am somewhat melancholy. The fragile forests that make orangutan life possible are fast disappearing. Where, I wonder, are the billionaire philanthropists and the international policies that will prevent orangutans -- and all great apes -- from going extinct?\nIndonesia is a vast, densely populated country where millions live in or near poverty. The temptation to exploit natural resources to feed people today, never mind tomorrow, and to expand the economy, is great. And the plantations are but one example. Surface-mining of gold in the alluvial fans of white sand has been practiced for two decades, leaving virtual moonscapes near the National Park where I work. Now zircon mining has entrenched itself all over Central Kalimantan, with each zircon mine obliterating 1,000 acres of rain forest. Two years ago nobody, myself included, even knew what zircon was.\nThe international community must recognize that it has some responsibility for what happens to the great rain forests of Indonesian Borneo. Foreign investment in local development programs needs to be expanded. Village level projects, like the one financed by the United States Agency for International Development and run by Boston-based World Education near where I work, have empowered farmers, strengthened village economies and employed local people, giving them a stake in preserving the forest.\nWe need more of these programs. Indonesia could also impose a special tax on companies that profit from rain forest destruction, with the revenues dedicated to forest and orangutan conservation. Proper labeling of palm oil content could allow a consumer boycott of soap, crackers, cookies and other products that contain it. Finally, Indonesia needs to be more vigorous in enforcing the excellent laws it already has to protect its forests.\nWhen I arrived in 1971, Borneo was almost a Garden of Eden, the most remote place on earth. Now it has been drawn into the global economy, one government decision, one business plan at a time. But the destruction of Borneo's forests and the extinction of the orangutans are not inevitable. It is possible to protect our ancient heritage and closest of kin -- one orangutan, one national park, one piece of irreplaceable forest at a time. We only need to decide to do it.\nOp-Ed Contributor Birute Mary Galdikas is president and co-founder of Orangutan Foundation International in Los Angeles and a professor at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia.
1816711	A Meeting With Gerald Ford	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E5D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	In the summer of 1975, I was asked by Robert Goldman, President Ford's in-house intellectual, to participate in a discussion on ethnicity at the White House, one of a series put on for the edification of the president.\nAmerica was then going through the so-called ethnic revival. Talk about the recovery of threatened ethnic heritage was everywhere, the beginnings of what later evolved into the multicultural and identity movement. Politicians had been quick to grasp the movement's potential, and it would become a controversial issue in the subsequent presidential election.\nI gathered from our conversation that the unusual nature of Ford's ascent to the presidency had prevented the normal electoral process of learning that transformed local politicians into potential statesmen, and that the discussions were a crash course substitute. The other members of the ethnicity session would be Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the future senator from New York, Nat Glazer, my colleague at Harvard, Michael Novak, a writer and public speaker who had recently emerged as the leading ideologist of the revival, and John Higham, the historian of immigration. I was flattered to be so honored, but felt it necessary to point out that I was then the friend of and special adviser to the second most radical leader in the hemisphere, Prime Minister Michael Manley of Jamaica, who at the time was very much on the radar screen of the C.I.A. and State Department. They already knew that, but my associations were deemed irrelevant. I was impressed.\nWe met one Saturday in an airy, informal part of the White House, the room flooded with the late-morning light of early fall. The president's golf game had gone on a bit longer than anticipated, and as we waited I mused to myself that we were being asked to perform the intellectual version of a medieval jousting tournament. Novak would passionately defend the ethnic revival; I was strongly against it. Higham was more of my persuasion. Moynihan and Glazer were presumably the moderates, but since their recently published text, ''Beyond the Melting Pot,'' had rapidly become the locus classicus of the new ethnicity, it was hardly an even match.\nThe president's entry was refreshingly lacking in drama. There was no sudden hush, no ego filling up the room, not the slightest whiff of alpha male testosterone. He was a fine-looking man, in a Lake Wobegon sort of way. Casually dressed and relaxed in manner, he shook hands firmly, apologized for being late with a self-effacing remark about his game, then invited us to have drinks with him. He finished two martinis before lunch. Moynihan and I happily joined him, while the others discreetly held glasses filled with something else.\nAccompanying the president was the soft-spoken young aide who had initiated and made this all possible. His shoulders hunched in a confiding way as he addressed us, and his thoughtful, collegial manner put us instantly at ease. This was Dick Cheney, the chief of staff, and I will never be able to reconcile the open, intellectually broad-minded person I met that day with the secretive éminence grise of today.\nDuring the discussion's more formal phase, I told the president that I had been drawn to America by the cosmopolitanism of its mainstream, not to seek sanctuary in an atavistic cocoon. I argued that all ethnic movements are two-edged swords. Beginning benignly, and sometimes necessary to repair injured collective psyches, they often end in tragedy, especially when they turn political, as illustrated by German history.\nI also argued that the ethnic revival was partly a reaction against the recent gains of black Americans. Sadly, black leaders' shift to separatism and identity politics had legitimized this reactionary backlash against them. Whatever the president's personal position, I urged him to keep the state out of it.\nThroughout our discussion the president listened attentively. He occasionally asked a question -- nothing profound, but enough to suggest that he was following it all quite closely. As we talked over lunch it slowly dawned on me that the president's behavior was the most inspiring display of self-assured humility I had ever witnessed. Here he sat, the most powerful man in the world, eager to learn about his own society, even from a recent immigrant.\nHe was a man at peace with himself. Uncomplicated but without a trace of shallowness; calm, dignified and quietly engaging, a person you would like to be your friend.\nOp-Ed Columnist Orlando Patterson, a professor of sociology at Harvard, is a guest columnist.

1816713	MAN IN THE NEWS: Ryan Clark Crocker; A Diplomat Used to Danger	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E4D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	When Ryan C. Crocker was trying to improve his Arabic in the late 1970s, he traveled to Jordan, made contact with a desert tribe and settled in for some hands-on training a little different from the standard State Department regimen.\n''He wound up being a shepherd for a week or two, chasing down stray sheep and living with the Bedouin,'' said Frederic C. Hof, a retired Army officer and author on the Middle East who recalls reading Mr. Crocker's official report on the trip when they were in language training.\nMr. Crocker, President Bush's choice as the new ambassador to Iraq, has brought the same intensity to his three-decade diplomatic career, amassing a record of Middle East and South Asia experience possibly unrivaled in the United States Foreign Service.\nHe has served as ambassador to Lebanon, Kuwait, Syria and, since 2004, Pakistan. He reopened the American Embassy in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. And he knows Iraq well; he worked there in the 1970s, led the State Department's Iraq-Kuwait task force during the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and returned to Baghdad for four months after the 2003 invasion as director of governance for the Coalition Provisional Authority.\nIn confronting Iraq's sectarian mayhem and the baffling mix of religious, political and tribal interests, he will be able to draw on many years of immersion in trouble spots with similar problems, including Beirut, where he survived the embassy bombing in 1983.\n''He's an absolutely first-rate professional who will manage the job with skill and sensitivity,'' said Edward S. Walker Jr., president of the Middle East Institute and a former American ambassador to Egypt and Israel. ''He has the cultural understanding that's so important to working in that region and that country.''\nStill, Mr. Walker said, the situation in Iraq is so intractable that it may prove impossible for any envoy to affect events decisively. ''We're facing a division in Iraq that may be beyond anyone's capacity to heal,'' he said.\nAssuming he is formally nominated and confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Crocker, 57, will succeed three men who had very different approaches to the job of top American representative in Baghdad. L. Paul Bremer III, who led the Coalition Provisional Authority, had little experience in the region and exercised control over emerging Iraqi leaders that critics found heavy-handed.\nJohn D. Negroponte, the first ambassador to the new government, took the opposite approach, encouraging Iraqis to take on responsibility and trying to remain in the background. Zalmay M. Khalilzad, who succeeded Mr. Negroponte, has taken a far stronger hand in pressing for reconciliation between the Shiite majority and the Sunni minority.\nFormer colleagues say Mr. Crocker is likely to be a less public presence in the Iraqi capital than Mr. Khalilzad, though they say he will work assiduously behind the scenes for the political accommodation necessary to reverse the slide to civil war.\nThey describe Mr. Crocker as a tough boss who drives himself as hard as he drives his staff. An accomplished marathon runner, he runs several miles early every morning, even in such danger spots as Beirut, where he was trailed by burly security guards who sometimes had to hop on bicycles to keep up.\nRobin L. Raphel, a senior diplomat who worked with Mr. Crocker in Baghdad in 2003, said he was responsible for helping to put together the Iraqi Governing Council, the provisional government that oversaw the country for a year after the fall of Saddam Hussein.\n''He's a very good persuader and negotiator,'' Ms. Raphel said. ''He has the background on a lot of the important figures in Iraq, and he's very good at sussing out who's who.''\nA former colleague who agreed to speak of Mr. Crocker candidly on condition of anonymity called him ''incredibly hard-working, very serious, a little introverted.''\n''I'd say he's more respected than loved in the State Department,'' the colleague said, ''but he certainly is respected. He's done the dirtiest, hardest assignments you can imagine.''\nIn Pakistan, Mr. Crocker has proved to be an ''old school'' ambassador who has put only limited pressure on President Pervez Musharraf, the military ruler who has sometimes frustrated the Bush administration by failing to act decisively against Al Qaeda and other militant groups, said Husain Haqqani, professor of international relations at Boston University.\n''He's not somebody who will come up with a new grand strategy to change the world,'' said Mr. Haqqani, a former Pakistani government official. ''But attempts to craft grand strategy have caused a lot of upheaval in American diplomacy.''\nBorn June 19, 1949, in Spokane, Wash., Ryan Clark Crocker grew up in an Air Force family and attended school in Morocco, Turkey and Canada, as well as the United States. He graduated from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., in 1971 and took his first Foreign Service assignment to the American Consulate in Khorramshahr, Iran, in 1972. He later worked in the embassies in Qatar, Iraq and Egypt. Because he prefers working overseas, he has rarely worked in Washington, but did hold a few posts there, including deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs.\nHe is married to Christine Barnes, a retired Foreign Service secretary, whom he met in Baghdad in 1979.

1816714	Highly Paid Chief Is Paid $210 Million to Go Away	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E3D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	THE new year began with a series of surprises, not all of them pleasant.\nThere was a blowup over excessive pay for corporate executives, worrying signs of a slowing economy, accelerating troubles for major manufacturers and new accusations of wrongdoing on Wall Street.\nThere was good news, too. Boeing said its order book was bulging, and the number of securities fraud class-action lawsuits fell last year to the lowest level in a decade.\nPAY FIGHT -- After enduring six years of mounting criticism over his pay package, an imperious management style and a listless stock price, Robert L. Nardelli, the chief executive of Home Depot, resigned abruptly. He left with a severance package worth $210 million. Over six years as chief executive, he had taken home $64 million and was on track to earn hundreds of millions more.\nIn a statement, Home Depot said the former chief executive and the company's board ''mutually agreed that Nardelli would leave his position.'' It added that Frank Blake, its vice chairman and one of Mr. Nardelli's lieutenants, would succeed him.\nThe $210 million in compensation for Mr. Nardelli will include deferred compensation, pensions and other benefits to which he was already entitled. It also included an extra $20 million cash payment that the company was not legally obliged to pay.\nThe developments reignited public debate about executive pay, just as the Securities and Exchange Commission is moving to modify disclosure rules. The changes will mask the true value of what senior executives are paid, critics say.\nRepresentative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee in the Democratic-controlled Congress, has said he will pursue legislation to curb executive salaries.\nWEAK ECONOMY -- Federal Reserve policy makers shed light on why they have held interest rates steady even though inflation is rising faster than their target rate: they are worried that the housing market slump may be a drag on the economy.\nThat came out when the Fed released minutes of the December meeting of its Open Market Committee.\nThe Fed's wary outlook surfaced as retailers said sales in December were disappointing, even after many had scaled back their fourth-quarter profit expectations. Some retailers also reduced forecasts for 2007.\nRetailers blamed mild weather that depressed winter clothing sales, but the flagging housing market and rising energy prices also had a big effect.\nEconomists generally expect the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting, at the end of the month, followed by possible reductions in rates later in the year.\nHEARING FOOTSTEPS -- General Motors and Ford Motor said they ended a year of slumping sales with an accelerating slide in December, when they sold about 13 percent fewer cars than in December 2005.\nWith consumers turning away from pickups and big sport utility vehicles, mainstays of both company's lineups, their share of the American market slid to just 53.7 percent for the year -- and just 51.5 percent for the month. Both are their lowest collective shares ever.\nToyota, meanwhile, set a sales record in 2006 and passed DaimlerChrysler to take third place in the American car market. Toyota is now bearing down on Ford, which it is expected to unseat this year to take second place in the United States, and may overtake G.M. as the largest carmaker in the world.\nToyota will soon decide whether to build two more plants in the United States, even as industry analysts forecast a slight decline in total sales for all makers in 2007. G.M. and Ford are closing factories.\nBOEING'S BACK -- Strong demand for its workhorse 737 narrow-body jet and robust sales of its new fuel-efficient 787 Dreamliner helped Boeing report a record 1,044 orders for commercial airplanes at the end of last year. That should be more than enough to surpass Airbus for the first time since 2000.\nAirbus, which has not yet reported December sales, said it had 687 firm orders as of the end of November.\nMeasured by actual deliveries, however, Airbus remains ahead. It was on pace to deliver about 425 commercial aircraft last year, while Boeing delivered 398. Airlines and leasing companies order planes years in advance, and sometimes increase, decrease or cancel those orders before the planes are delivered.\nAirbus is scheduled to announce its 2006 order total on Jan. 17.\nHEDGE INQUIRY -- William F. Galvin, the secretary of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, has asked UBS for information to determine whether it is using cheap office space to entice hedge funds to do business with the firm, possibly at the expense of the funds' investors.\nUBS leases space to hedge funds and provides them with office help at a tower in Boston, said Brian McNiff, a spokesman for Mr. Galvin. Investigators suspect that UBS expected the hedge funds to execute their trades through the bank, paying higher fees in return for the space.\nOther banks may also come in for scrutiny. Bear Stearns, for example, also offers space in so-called hedge fund hotels in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\nFEWER SUITS -- Just days after Wall Street began a campaign to curb what it said was a surge in shareholder lawsuits encouraged by a 2002 corporate-disclosure reform law, Stanford University reported that securities fraud class-action lawsuits fell last year to the lowest number in a decade.\nThe study, from the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse, said the number of class actions declined 38 percent, to just 110 filings, compared with 178 in 2005. Last year's total was 43 percent below the 10-year historical average.\nThe clearinghouse is run jointly by the Stanford Law School and Cornerstone Research, which provides advice to lawyers in commercial lawsuits.\nExcluding suits over stock option backdating, which has embroiled 130 companies so far, the decline is even bigger, researchers said.\nThe number of suits is likely to fall further because regulations adopted after recent scandals have discouraged fraud, encouraged good practices and energized law enforcement, said Joseph A. Grundfest, the professor who runs the clearinghouse.\nMOST POPULAR -- Following are the most-popular business news articles on nytimes.com from Dec. 30 through Jan. 5:\n1.

Bakish as president of MTV Networks International.\nHe will report to William H. Roedy, who is global chairman of MTV Networks and has oversight of MTV's international operation. MTV is a unit of Viacom.\nIn addition, the company named Wade Davis as senior vice president for strategy mergers and acquisitions for Viacom. He will oversee mergers and acquisitions in addition to being responsible for strategic planning and development.\nIn a third move, Viacom said that it had formed a new global digital media executive team that will report to Mika Salmi, president of Global digital media for MTV Networks.\nIn an interview Mr. Bakish said MTV wanted to focus on improving programming in crucial markets like Germany and Great Britain.\nOne media analyst, Richard Greenfield at Pali Research, noted that business for MTV Networks has been very weak in Britain, in part because of a poor advertising market.\nGermany was also a trouble spot last year, in part because MTV Networks benefited from a major advertising buy in 2005 from Jamba, a ring-tone company. Then Jamba unexpectedly pulled its advertising, resulting in unfavorably comparisons of operating income.\n''Now the company can focus on the programming side,'' Mr. Greenfield said of MTV, ''and the cost structure both in the United Kingdom and in Germany.''\nMr. Bakish said he anticipates significant play in growth markets like India.\n''We have MTV and Nickelodeon distributed there, but cable and satellite become increasingly important. We see the chance to build a more significant business,'' he said.\nHe added that the company believes that the combination of its programming and consumer products will increase revenue in smaller emerging market countries.\nMr. Bakish is moving to MTV's international division from Viacom where he had been executive vice president for strategic planning and business development.
1816716	Google Makes Another Investment in the Internet in China	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E2D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Like almost all of the American Internet giants that have ventured this far, Google is losing in China. So too, are eBay, Yahoo and Amazon. But flush with cash, Google -- the world's leading search engine company -- is beginning to invest heavily in research and development here. In its latest move, announced Friday, Google struck a deal to invest about $5 million in one of the country's fastest-growing Internet start-ups, Xunlei.com, according to people close to the deal.\nThat follows another hook-up this week, when Google said it would team with China Mobile, the country's dominant, government-owned mobile telephone carrier, to offer mobile search services using the Internet.\nIn 2005, the company lured Kaifu Lee, the former head of Microsoft research in China, to shore up its base here. And now the company is looking to sprinkle investments in start-ups and partnerships with Chinese companies.\nThe investment in Xunlei is small compared with Google's $1.65 billion acquisition of YouTube.com last October. But the deals announced this week are an attempt to be smarter about breaking into China's fast-growing but complex Internet market, which now has about 130 million users, making it second in size only to the United States.\nWith Xunlei, Google gains another path into the rapidly growing demand in China for downloading music and video over the Internet.\n''It's not YouTube, but it's close enough,'' says Richard Ji, an Internet analyst at Morgan Stanley. ''Xunlei is a very interesting company. It's a leader in video downloading and so this should help Google in the battle with Baidu.''\nBaidu.com is the 500-pound gorilla in China. The company, an Internet search engine start-up began operating only a few years ago and has one of the most-trafficked Web sites in the world. The look of its home page is similar to that of Google, which invested in Baidu several years ago, but then sold its small stake for a huge gain last year, after Baidu went public on the Nasdaq. Other big brand names here are Sina, Sohu, NetEase and Alibaba.com.\nAccording to iResearch, which tracks the search engine market here, Baidu had a commanding 63 percent share of the market in October, the most recent period for which data is available. Google was second, with 19 percent. Yahoo had only 7.6 percent of the market.\nOne of the most popular features on Baidu.com is downloading music through its MP3 program search service.\nXunlei, based in the southern city of Shenzhen, is gaining popularity. It was started by two computer science graduate students from Duke University, Zou Shenglong and Cheng Hao, in Silicon Valley in 2002. Mr. Zou had previously worked as a technician in Silicon Valley and Mr. Cheng was once a senior manager at Baidu. After getting $20 million in venture backing from Morningside Ventures and IDG VC Partners and moving the company to China in 2003, Xunlei.com seems to have great promise.\nOfficials at Xunlei.com say that more than 120 million people have used its software, and the company has also signed up some major advertisers, including KFC and Motorola.\nDick X. Wei, an Internet analyst at J. P. Morgan, says a partnership between Google and Xunlei can enhance video and music search content for Google, help Google bolster traffic growth in China and help the company better compete against Baidu.\nIn announcing the deal on Friday, Kaifu Lee, the president of Google Greater China, said Xunlei's Web site would provide a solid platform for Google. That would help it gain a foothold in the country's booming market for downloading things like video and music, online games, software and cellphone ring tones.\nLast month, eBay's struggling China operation was forced to team with Tom.com, a Beijing-based Internet company controlled by the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing.\nOther major American companies have stumbled in China. Monster.com bought China HR, then lost market share. Amazon.com bought Joyo.com, and lost market share. Expedia.com acquired a big Chinese Internet travel company and slipped. And a few years ago, Yahoo bought 3721.com, its biggest competitor here, then handed its operations over to Alibaba.com.\n''The globally dominant U.S. Internet companies have failed to take the No. 1 market share position in any category,'' said Jason Brueschke, an Internet analyst at Citigroup. ''And so there's something fundamentally different about this market.''\nSome analysts say China's tight regulatory controls over the Internet favor Chinese companies. They also say Chinese companies have been better at creating Internet products for the particular taste of the Chinese. For that reason, some American Internet giants are increasingly looking for Chinese partners.
1816717	San Francisco to Go Wireless	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E2D71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	After eight months of sometimes difficult negotiations, EarthLink and the city of San Francisco said on Friday that they had reached an agreement to create a citywide wireless broadband network.\nThe Internet search giant Google will provide free service on the network at relatively low transmission speeds, while EarthLink and others will charge for faster service. The monthly fee will be $21.95, but 3,200 low-income residents will be charged $12.95.\n''You can't continue to rhetorically talk about the digital divide and not do anything about it,'' Gavin Newsom, the city's mayor, said in an interview.\nThe network will be built, owned and operated by EarthLink, which last year estimated the initial cost of deployment at about $6 million. EarthLink will also pay certain fees to the city for access to rights of way and city property.\nThe project has faced opposition from a variety of critics, including some who argued that the city should own the broadband network and some who raised fears of privacy violations. The new agreement establishes some basic privacy protections and requires EarthLink and Google to fully disclose their privacy policies.\nMr. Newsom said that as early as next week he would submit the plan to the County Board of Supervisors, which must give its final approval to the project. The network could begin operating within a year of approval.\nGoogle already owns and operates a free wireless broadband network in Mountain View, the Bay Area city where it is based.\nMegan Quinn, a Google spokeswoman, said the company did not plan to require users of the free service to look at advertising.

1816721	DuPont Drops Plan for Nerve Gas Wastewater	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407EFD71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Bringing an abrupt end to a three-year fight between environmentalists and federal officials, the DuPont Company announced on Friday that it would not participate in an Army plan to dispose of wastewater from neutralized VX nerve gas by dumping it into the Delaware River.\nThe decision was a victory for environmentalists who questioned how placing wastewater from the neutralized form of the deadly nerve agent would affect the river. Created for use by the military, VX is considered one of the world's most toxic chemicals. Exposure to its active form can kill within minutes.\nThe Army plan involved bringing VX wastewater from a chemical treatment center in Newport, Ind., to a DuPont plant in Deepwater, N.J.\nBut, citing what was expected to be a long and contentious approval process by state environmental regulators, officials at E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company said they would not take part in the effort.\n''During our three-year evaluation of the Newport proposal, it has become increasingly clear to us that the approval process will be lengthy and arduous,'' Nicholas C. Fanandakis, a vice president and general manager at DuPont, said in a statement. ''Therefore, we believe it is in the best interests of New Jersey and DuPont not to proceed.''\nThe decision was hailed by elected officials and environmentalists on both sides of the Delaware, including Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, who had questioned the plan in 2004 while he was a member of the United States Senate.\n''It's now official,'' Mr. Corzine said in a statement. ''VX will never be dumped in the Delaware River or any other New Jersey waterway. This is a decisive victory for the people of New Jersey. VX nerve agent is one of the world's most deadly chemical compounds, and dumping it in a river never made any sense.''\nMr. Corzine credited the state's Congressional delegation, including Representative Robert E. Andrews, with helping to bring about the company's decision.\nMr. Andrews said that he and other members of the delegation had recently commissioned a report by the federal Government Accountability Office, to be released this month, to examine the soundness of the Army's proposal.\n''I believe that forthcoming report played a role in DuPont's very commendable decision,'' Mr. Andrews said in a telephone interview.\nMr. Fanandakis said that DuPont abandoned the project despite endorsements for it by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection Agency.\nA spokesman for the Army's chemical materials agency said that it would continue to review other options for disposing of the neutralized VX gas.\nMickey Morales, an Army spokesman, said in a statement that although federal officials were disappointed, they appreciated DuPont's work ''in this effort to rid our nation of the threat associated with continued storage of these obsolete chemical weapons.''\nDuPont and the Army had been working together for the last few years on the plan to dispose of the waste. Because DuPont had not formally agreed to take on the project, the two sides had not entered into a contract, and no money related to the disposal of the waste was lost because of DuPont's decision.\nThe plan under consideration would have shipped waste from the Army's Newport Chemical Depot in Indiana to the DuPont plant, near the Delaware Memorial Bridge in South Jersey.\nWorkers at the depot neutralize the nerve gas in a process that includes mixing it with hot water and sodium hydroxide to form a nonlethal, but still caustic, material known as hydrolysate. Some compare its potency to that of household cleaning products.\nThe Army plan called for DuPont to remove any remaining harmful chemicals from the hydrolysate before dumping it into the Delaware. Mr. Morales said that the Army had neutralized little more than a third of its total stockpile of 1,269 tons of VX gas, and that the depot in Indiana was equipped to handle all of the hydrolysate wastewater expected to be produced.\nEnvironmentalists had received assurances that the water would not be harmful to the Delaware, but continued to question the Army plan. Late last month, a coalition of environmental groups from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Kentucky filed suit against the Army.\nOn Friday, environmentalists in New Jersey and Pennsylvania welcomed the DuPont decision.\n''This is a great day for the river and the people of New Jersey, Delaware and the states that the nerve agent waste would have been trucked through,'' said Maya van Rossum of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, a plaintiff in the suit. ''This is the right decision by DuPont.''\nJeff Tittel, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, said: ''They had a lot of nerve to dump on New Jersey. I'm glad they realized this was a bad idea.''
1816722	Leaked Notes on '08 Show Giuliani Without the Spin	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06EFD71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The country sure has been enjoying itself reading about the Rudy Caper, feasting on the inside dish gleaned from Rudolph W. Giuliani's presidential playbook.\nThe purloined or lost document gives outsiders a glimpse behind the curtain, a rare look at political calculations that, if predictable in their revelations, are decidedly surprising in their candor. Irresistible. The unexpected -- the macaca tidbit, it might be called today -- is always irresistible in the game of control that is politics.\nConsider the alternative: Mr. Giuliani's own site on the Internet JoinRudy2008.com, which went up last month when he formed his presidential exploratory committee. Anyone with a computer can access the cheerful red, white and blue site to learn how the former mayor wants the public to see him, how he would like to be portrayed in a presidential campaign.\nThe Rudy Giuliani portrayed on JoinRudy2008.com is a dragon slayer with a record of unmitigated success. He is a man with an open smile, replacing the fearsome City Hall scowl that he used so often to great effect.\nWhile the site is shiny and superspun, the campaign document -- whether it was stolen and leaked by a Giuliani political opponent as the former mayor contends, or provided to The Daily News by someone sympathetic to a rival, as the newspaper contends -- is dark and forthright.\nAnd so the leaked campaign notebook has created a stir, and surely not for its contents. What else should Giuliani advisers do but plan to raise a lot of money from the superrich, and worry about their man's political vulnerabilities?\nThe Giuliani campaign document is anti-spin. Meant for insider eyes, it concedes that Mr. Giuliani as a presidential candidate may have to contend with such trouble as questions about his former wife, Donna Hanover, and his former associate, the controversial Bernard B. Kerik. It cites concerns about Mr. Giuliani's relatively liberal positions on social issues -- stances not likely to find favor with the Republican Party's conservative wing.\nThis is all surely true.\nThe other way to look at these matters is: Don't look at them. That is the JoinRudy2008.com Web site's way.\nFor instance, the Web site liberally features Judith Nathan, Mr. Giuliani's current wife, providing a polished version of her career, accompanied by two flattering photographs.\nNowhere on the site is there even a mention of Ms. Hanover, married to Mr. Giuliani for 18 years and the mother of his two children. They divorced in 2002 after Mr. Giuliani announced to a stunned press corps, without, Ms. Hanover later said, telling her first, that the couple was splitting up.\nThe Web site doesn't mention Mr. Giuliani's first wife either, Regina Peruggi.\nIt does not mention the former mayor's two children, Andrew and Caroline.\nIt does not mention Mr. Kerik, the disgraced former police commissioner who would have been the secretary of homeland security today if his messy past hadn't caught up with him.\nIt does not mention Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African immigrant whose death in 1999 in a fusillade of 41 police bullets was one of the most wrenching episodes of the Giuliani mayoralty.\nThe Web site does not cite the social issues referred to in the leaked document either -- his support for abortion rights, civil rights for gay people, and gun control, for instance -- positions that are not popular with many conservative Republicans.\nAs many political analysts have frequently pointed out, his record and conduct before the Sept. 11 attack are not well known to those beyond the borders of New York City, and as a private citizen for the last five years, he has often been able to stay above the political infighting on issues like Iraq or global warming, unless he has chosen to get involved.\nThe Web site won't fill in the blanks, focusing as it naturally does on Mr. Giuliani's strongest and best-known accomplishments, from presiding over a significant reduction in crime to becoming ''America's Mayor'' after Sept. 11.\nHis record is portrayed only in a successful light.\nMissing is any reference to the famous Giuliani combativeness, which he and many (not all) New Yorkers seemed to relish; that crime had actually begun to go down before he took office; that the city, which improved in many areas during his mayoralty, was still not a utopia after two terms of his leadership; that polls showed that many New Yorkers, including some who had voted for him, had grown weary of his pugnacious style.\nAsked about the site's contents yesterday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, Sunny Mindel, said she would not comment.\nThe Web sites of other prospective candidates are just as relentlessly positive because, political strategists note, they are no more than the cyberspace version of campaign brochures.\nMost voters recognize the limitations of today's managed politics, those same strategists say -- from the sound bite to the carefully modulated speech -- and so relish the unscripted moments. Almost as much as reporters do.\nPOLITICAL MEMO
1816723	Encouraging More Reality In Economics	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801EFD71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The annual meeting of the American Economic Association, which opened here on Friday, is usually a pretty esoteric affair.\nBut this year it could resonate much more broadly as the departing president of the organization, which represents most of the nation's academic economists, tries to push prevailing economic theory further away from the free market approach that has generally held sway for the last four decades.\nThe protagonist in this drama is George A. Akerlof, a Nobel laureate, who is using the same platform that the late Milton Friedman adopted in 1968. As president of the A.E.A. back then, Friedman laid out new theoretical justifications for a market system that he argued performs most favorably for nearly everyone when the government avoids tinkering with its operation.\nThe hundreds of economists who listened that day to Mr. Friedman's memorable speech did not immediately embrace his ideas. Keynesian economics, with a big role for government, still held sway.\nBut over time the Friedman approach took hold, eventually having profound effects on politics and government policy far beyond the ivory tower. This was partly because of Mr. Friedman's insistent, larger-than-life personality, and partly because Keynesian economics failed to adequately explain and respond to the simultaneous outbreak of higher inflation and rising unemployment that emerged in the 1970s.\nMr. Akerlof's style, in contrast, is more diffident and modest. But he has already contributed significantly to a revamping of the economic theory that Mr. Friedman championed. Now, at 66, he is hoping to spread that debate by taking on some of the profession's most sacred cows.\nAnd he is doing so at the moment when income inequality, more concentrated wealth and upheavals from expanded globalization are straining faith in a relatively unfettered market system.\n''I am trying to effect a return to sensible economics,'' Mr. Akerlof said in an interview. ''And what is sensible economics? It is very pragmatic. You think about problems in the world and you ask: can government do something about that? At the same time, you maintain your skepticism that government is often inefficient.''\nThis challenge is not from some outsider in economics. Mr. Akerlof -- educated at Yale and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and currently a professor at the University of California, Berkeley -- is at the heart of the academic establishment. His wife, Janet Yellen, a top economist in the Clinton administration, is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Their son, Robert, is a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Harvard.\nThe stakes are considerable. Keynesians, for example, argued that the government could use changes in taxes and spending to help push the economy to full employment without running the risk of excessive inflation. Friedman, by contrast, described a ''natural rate'' of unemployment below which the nation could not go without causing wages and prices to spiral upward.\nIn the text of his speech to be delivered on Saturday afternoon, Mr. Akerlof argues that the Friedman approach is based on false assumptions about human behavior.\nFor example, he says, people don't automatically insist on raises that keep their pay on par with inflation. They often are happy with smaller raises, considering them a compliment from the boss for valued work.\nThat makes pressure for higher pay less inflationary than the Friedman approach would assume.\nA result, Mr. Akerlof says, is misleading theory and misguided policy.\nMr. Akerlof is facing considerable criticism for his view that standard economics leaves out too much actual human motivation. What Mr. Akerlof sees as missing content, Mark Gertler, a New York University economist, describes as ''frictions'' that distort accurate theory.\n''What Akerlof is doing is stepping out of line,'' said Mr. Gertler, who did research with Ben S. Bernanke before Mr. Bernanke became chairman of the Federal Reserve. ''A lot of people are correctly taking rational behavior as a baseline and are adding frictions, such as constraints on borrowing, that can lead to temporarily inefficient markets.''\nMore than most economists, Mr. Akerlof goes far afield to gather information that he considers to be played down or ignored in ways that leave mainstream economics divorced from real life.\nIn his speech, he encourages others to follow his lead, rejecting the focus on what he calls ''parsimonious modeling'' inspired by Friedman. Everyday experience and observation must be returned to a prominent place in the profession, he argues.\n''The early Keynesians got a great deal of the workings of the economic system right in ways that are now denied,'' Mr. Akerlof said in a study newly posted on the Internet that closely tracks the text of his speech. ''They based their models, as Keynes put it, on 'our knowledge of human nature and from the detailed facts of experience.' ''\nA lot of what Mr. Akerlof advocates in his speech is already under way, with Mr. Akerlof himself a major contributor. He shared a Nobel in economics in 2001 for his work on imperfect information, concluding, for example, that economic outcomes are altered when a used-car salesman knows more about the condition of a vehicle he is selling than the buyer. It was an imbalance that helped to produce state ''lemon laws'' that protect buyers.\nHe was an early participant in behavioral economics, another assault on the rational, fully-informed behavior that Mr. Friedman counted on to make markets work efficiently without regulation or intervention.\nPeople often do not behave rationally, the behaviorists found in their experiments. Most do not bother to sign up for a voluntary 401(k) plan, for example, but do not pull out of such a plan if an employer signs them up automatically.\nNow Mr. Akerlof is taking a big step on his own. His speech is based on more than a year of research, much of it done with Rachel Kranton, a University of Maryland economist. They are trying to incorporate into theory, as Keynes once did, the great variety of ''norms'' that determine human behavior.\nWhat Mr. Akerlof is trying to do, with Ms. Kranton's help, is to reflect the variety of motivations that come from the sense people have of ''what they are and how they should behave,'' as Ms. Kranton put it.\nAmong the examples they cite:\nA teacher in good standing among the parents of her students puts the preservation of that reputation ahead of attempts to maximize her pay.\nA change in income will permanently alter a worker's spending, a view that challenges the more common belief that spending matches a worker's lifetime income and savings, evening out over time.\nWorkers resist wage cuts even when unemployment is rising, despite standard theory that they will accept less pay to save their jobs.\nThe variations in norms and behavior are numerous and Mr. Akerlof, in his speech, calls on economists to incorporate this diversity into standard economic theory.\n''If there is a difference between real behavior and behavior derived from abstract preferences, New Classical economics has no way to pick up those preferences,'' Mr. Akerlof asserts. ''A macroeconomics that incorporates observations regarding how people think they should behave combines the best of the two approaches.''
1816724	The Land of Rising Conservation; Japan Offers a Lesson in Using Technology to Reduce Energy Consumption	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00EFD71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	In many countries, higher oil prices have hurt pocketbooks and led to worries about economic slowdowns. But here in Japan, Kiminobu Kimura, an architect, says he has not felt the pinch. In fact, his monthly energy bill is lower than a year ago.\nA reason is his new home fuel cell, a machine as large and quiet as a filing cabinet that sits in front of his house and turns hydrogen into electricity and cold water into hot -- at a fraction of regular utility costs. But even with the futuristic device, which is available for now only in Japan, Mr. Kimura has not let up on the other shortcuts that leave him unscathed by last year's oil squeeze.\nEnergy-efficient appliances abound in the many corners of his cramped home. There is the refrigerator that beeps when left open and the dishwasher that is compact enough to sit on the kitchen counter. In some homes, room heaters have a sensor that directs heat only toward occupants; there are ''energy navigators'' that track a home's energy use.\nAnd then Mr. Kimura, 48, says there are the little things that his family of four does to squeeze fuel bills, like reusing warm bath water to wash laundry and bicycling to buy groceries.\n''It's not just technology, it's a whole mind-set,'' said Hitoshi Ikuma, a specialist in energy issues at the Japan Research Institute. ''Energy conservation is almost an obsession here among government, companies, regular citizens, everyone.''\nJapan is the most energy-efficient developed country on earth, according to most specialists, who say it is much better prepared than the United States to prosper in an era of higher global energy prices. And if there is any lesson that Japan can offer to Americans, they say, it is that there is no one fix-all solution to living with oil above $50 a barrel.\nRather, as Mr. Kimura shows, it is a combination of many things, from the most advanced technologies to the simplest frugality in everyday life -- and an obsession with saving energy that keeps his family huddled in a single heated room during winter.\nJapan tops most global comparisons of energy efficiency in wealthy nations. Its population and economy are each about 40 percent as large as that of the United States, yet in 2004 it consumed less than a quarter as much energy as America did, according to the International Energy Agency, which is based in Paris.\nThat means Japan consumed the energy equivalent of 2.8 million tons of oil per person in 2004, in contrast to 5.4 million tons per American. Germany, another energy-conscious country, used 3.2 million tons per person. On other measures, like household electricity use, Japan is also much lower.\nJapan's obsession with conservation stems from an acute sense of insecurity in a resource-poor nation that imports most its energy from the volatile Middle East, a fact driven home here by the 1970s shocks. The guiding hand of government has also played a role, forcing households and companies to conserve by raising the cost of gasoline and electricity far above global levels. Taxes and price controls make a gallon of gasoline in Japan currently cost about $5.20, twice America's more market-based prices.\nThe government in turn has used these tax revenues to help Japan seize the lead in renewable energies like solar power, and more recently home fuel cells. One way has been a subsidy of about $51,000 for each home fuel cell. This allowed Mr. Kimura to buy his cell last year for about $9,000, far below production cost. His cell, which generates one kilowatt per hour, provides just under half of his household's electricity, and has cut his electricity bill by the same amount, he said.\nThe device works by converting natural gas into hydrogen, which the fuel cell then uses to generate electricity. Heat released by the process is used to warm water.\nThe first two fuel cells were installed in the prime minister's residence in April 2005. Since then, some 1,300 have been sold, according to the trade ministry. The ministry forecasts that as sales pick up, production cost will fall to about $5,000 by decade's end. Experts say that Japan is far more willing to embrace new technologies than the United States, where opposition to hydrogen storage tanks in Tarrytown, N.Y., forced General Motors to scrap an experimental filling station for fuel-cell cars last year.\nHigher energy prices have also created strong domestic demand in Japan for more conventional and new energy-saving products of all sorts. That has spurred the invention and development of things like low-energy washing machines and televisions and high-mileage cars and hybrid vehicles, experts say. Japanese factories also learned how to cut energy use and become among the most efficient in the world.\nCompanies like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are now reaping the benefits in booming overseas sales of their highly efficient electric turbines, steel blast furnaces and other industrial machinery, particularly in the United States. The environment ministry forecasts that exports will help turn energy conservation into a $7.9 billion industry in Japan by 2020, about 10 times its size in 2000.\n''Japan has taught itself how to survive with energy prices that are twice as high as everywhere else,'' said Kouichi Iwama, an economics professor at Wako University who advises the Japanese Parliament on energy policy.\nBut with a few exceptions like cars, many of Japan's efficient consumer products have yet to make their way overseas, according to corporate executives. Partly, that is because while more energy-efficient, they are also more expensive. But another reason is that many appliances here are designed for Japan's conservation-conscious lifestyle, which includes things like smaller homes and a lack of central heating.\nMr. Kimura says he, his wife, and two teenage children all take turns bathing in the same water, a common practice here. Afterward, the still-warm water is sucked through a rubber tube into the nearby washing machine to clean clothes. Wet laundry is hung outside to dry or under a heat lamp in the bathroom.\n''In Japan, it's natural to think about saving energy,'' Mr. Kimura explains. ''We learned not to waste from our parents, who had learned it from the hardship of the war and after,'' he said.\nThe different approach is also apparent in the layout of Mr. Kimura's home, which at 1,188 square feet is about the average size of a house in Japan but only about half as big as the average American one. The rooms are also small, making them easier to heat or cool. The largest is the living room, which is about the size of an American bedroom.\nDuring winter, the entire family, including the miniature dachshund, gathers here, which is often the only room heated. Like most Japanese homes, Mr. Kimura's does not have central heating. The hallways, stairwell and bathrooms are left cold. The three bedrooms have wall-mounted heaters, which are used only when the rooms are occupied, and switched off at night.\nThe living room is kept toasty by hot water running through pipes under the floor. Mr. Kimura says such ambient heat saves money. He says the energy bill for his home is about 20,000 yen ($168) a month. Central heating alone would easily double or triple his energy bill, he says.\n''Central heating is just too extravagant,'' says Mr. Kimura, who is solidly middle class.\nThe government has tried to foster a culture of conservation with regular campaigns like this winter's Warm Biz, a call to businesspeople to don sweaters and long johns under their gray suits so that office thermostats could be set lower. It has also encouraged development of energy-saving appliances with its Top Runner program, which has set goals for reducing energy use.\nProducts that meet the goals are awarded a green sticker, while those that fail get an orange sticker. Japan's trade and industry ministry says consumers heed the stickers, pushing manufacturers to raise the energy efficiency. The average air-conditioner now uses two-thirds less electricity than in 1997, and the average freezer 23 percent less, the ministry said.\nThe savings add up. The average household here used 4,177 kilowatt- hours of electricity in 2001, the most recent figure, according to the Jyukankyo Research Institute in Tokyo. In the same year, the average American household consumed more than twice that, or 10,655 kilowatt hours, according to the Energy Department.\n''The Japanese use less energy, there's no doubt about that,'' said Alan K. Meier, a scientist specializing in energy efficiency at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. ''Some of it is more efficient appliances, but these are only part of a different lifestyle and one that's more energy-conscious.''\nThe Energy Challenge\nCorrection: January 10, 2007, Wednesday An article in Business Day on Saturday about the energy efficient ways of the Japanese misstated the amount of energy consumed in Japan and the United States as measured in tons of oil per person. Japan consumed the energy equivalent of 2.8 tons of oil per person in 2004, not 2.8 million tons. Likewise, the United States consumed 5.4 tons of oil per person, not 5.4 million tons. The article also referred imprecisely to the output from a home fuel cell used by a Japanese homeowner, Kiminobu Kimura. The cell produces one kilowatt of power per hour; not one kilowatt per hour.
1816725	Job Growth Is Strong, Surprising Economists	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EFD71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Job growth was brisk last month as businesses added to their payrolls with surprising confidence, further evidence that the economy is not likely to slip into a recession.\nThis growth helped both the employed and the unemployed. The prospects for working Americans strengthened as wages for most workers climbed at a steady clip. Those looking for a job last month found a more welcoming job market, and the amount of time they spent out of work dropped considerably.\nThe national unemployment rate held steady at a low 4.5 percent.\nSuch strong numbers, reported yesterday in the government's monthly survey of households and businesses, came as a surprise to many economists, who expected the slowing economy to pressure employers to rein in hiring.\nThe report also came just two days after an employment survey from a private statistics firm suggested that businesses had shed 40,000 jobs last month.\n''Such weakness as we have seen in the job market has been quite narrowly confined to those sectors immediately affected, like construction and manufacturing,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for Global Insight. ''It really does help alleviate fears of a cumulative downturn spreading from housing and pulling everything down.''\nThe report dashed cold water on those who were expecting the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates anytime soon. Investors, who have been counting on a rate cut by the central bank sometime in the first half of the year, bid stocks lower on the news and sent the bond market reeling. On Wall Street, stocks had their worst day since the end of November.\nThe Labor Department reported that employment outside the farming sector grew by 167,000 jobs in December, seasonally adjusted -- more than enough to absorb natural growth in the work force. In another sign of just how strong the job market has been, the figures for October and November were revised to show that businesses hired more employees than the government first thought.\nWith the housing market in a slump, builders eliminated 3,000 jobs in December, after cutting substantially more in October and November. And economists said that had it not been for unseasonably warm weather, builders probably would have eliminated even more workers.\nDownsizing in the American auto industry helped contribute to an overall decline in manufacturing jobs last month. For the year, manufacturers shed a net 72,000 jobs.\nRetailers, too, shrunk their payrolls last month, reflecting a weak holiday shopping season. Home-improvement supply stores, clothing stores and sporting goods stores led the industry in jobs cut.\nBut the services sector of the economy showed considerable strength. Professional and business services -- companies that offer things like administrative support, computer software design and waste management -- added a net 50,000 jobs last month. Health care providers added 31,000 new jobs, and so did hospitality businesses like restaurants and bars.\nIn all, the largest percentage of the population since September 2001 was employed in December. The employment-population ratio edged up a tenth of a percentage point, to 63.4 percent.\n''You want to see folks who are sitting on the sidelines able to come in and find work,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. ''You've had a really important expansion in labor force, in particular by people who were waiting for jobs and wages to heat up a bit.''\nNot only are more Americans working, but they are being paid more for it. Average wages have been outpacing inflation by enough of a margin in recent months that workers have seen some of the biggest real gains in their paychecks this decade.\nIn December, that trend appeared to continue as the average hourly earning for a worker in a nonmanagerial position climbed 8 cents, to $17.04. That was a 4.2 percent gain compared with December 2005, and it matched November's rise, which was the highest in more than five years. It has not topped that rate in more than six years.\nSome recent evidence had suggested that wage gains were beginning to taper off, but yesterday's Labor Department statistics showed that workers continued to enjoy the benefits of a strong labor market.\n''If you want a signal of what the labor market looks like, see if employers are paying more,'' said Drew Mathus, an economist with Lehman Brothers.\nIt appears that employers are giving their workers raises because tightness in the labor market demands it. The report is not likely to put any pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates .\n''The Fed has got to be pleased with these numbers,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist with Oak Associates, a money management firm in Akron, Ohio. ''Interest rates are where they should be.''\nJobless Rate Falls in Canada By The New York Times\nOTTAWA, Jan. 5 -- Canada's unemployment rate fell to a 30-year low of 6.1 percent as employers added 62,000 jobs last month, Statistics Canada said on Friday.\nThe government agency said that during all of 2006, employment rose by 2.1 percent, its strongest increase since 2002.\nMuch of the growth came in Alberta, where energy production has created labor shortages for oil and gas projects. Employment there rose by 6 percent, the most in 26 years.\nThe agency said that 7 of Canada's 10 provinces reached record high employment rates during 2006.\nIt estimates that about 80 percent of the new jobs created last year were full-time positions.\nThe job growth, however, did not extend to every sector. Manufacturing was down by 2.7 percent and what the agency calls the ''information, culture and recreational services'' sector also experienced job losses, particularly in British Columbia. That sector includes tourism which, like export-related manufacturing, is being squeezed by the high value of the Canadian dollar.
1816726	Tipping Over A Defense Of Enron	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502EFD71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Malcolm Gladwell is one smart cookie.\nA star of The New Yorker magazine, Mr. Gladwell has written a host of contrarian, provocative articles in recent years on meaty subjects like racial profiling and plagiarism. He is also the author of two best-selling books, one of which, ''The Tipping Point,'' has become part of the language, influencing the culture in general and business in particular.\nAs with many New Yorker readers, I count myself a fan. And precisely because he sometimes makes business his subject, I half-assumed that one of these days, I would write a column about him.\nNot this column, though.\nThis week, The New Yorker ran an article by Mr. Gladwell, entitled ''Open Secrets,'' that the author describes on his blog as ''my semi-defense of Enron.'' No kidding. The article opens, rather poignantly, with the scene of the former Enron chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling -- ''a pillar of the Houston community''-- receiving a harsh 24-year sentence last October for his role in the Enron fraud, ''one of the heaviest sentences ever given to a white-collar criminal.''\nFrom there, Mr. Gladwell goes on to make the argument, provocatively, of course, that the Enron debacle was always hidden in plain sight. The signs were there in the company's financial disclosure documents. Yes, they were complicated and convoluted, but if you knew what to look for, you could, at the very least, sniff out the fact that Enron was a company with lots of problems.\nHe dismisses the notion that ''senior executives,'' including Mr. Skilling, withheld critical information from investors. The problem, Mr. Gladwell concludes, is that the potential receivers of that information, the investing community, primarily, either didn't know how to dissect Enron's financials or couldn't be bothered. Thus, the Enron scandal was as much the fault of investors as it was any Enron executive now in prison.\nIn his blog, Mr. Gladwell goes even further. ''Can anyone explain -- in plain English -- what it is that Jeff Skilling and Co. did wrong?'' He continues: ''The question is strictly a legal one: according to the way accounting rules were written at the time, what specific transgressions were Skilling guilty of that merited 24 years in prison?''\nI CONFESS that I thought I was done with Enron. But it strikes me as important to wrestle with Mr. Gladwell's position. Already, ''Open Secrets'' has been embraced by those who argue that the Enron prosecutions were an effort to ''criminalize'' what amounted to flawed business decisions. The efforts to weaken Sarbanes-Oxley are also rooted in the idea that the country overreacted to Enron and the other corporate scandals. In effect, the central defense argument -- that Enron didn't really do anything illegal -- has been given new life by Mr. Gladwell. And it isn't remotely true.\nWhen I called Mr. Gladwell a few days ago, he backpedaled from his ''semi-defense'' position. ''I wasn't interested in exonerating Enron,'' he told me. ''I was interested in the kind of question it represented. I didn't go into the legal case because I didn't understand the legal case. What I wanted to see was what investors reasonably could have known about the company prior to it falling apart. On that question, the investment community bears equal culpability to make sense of inherently complex environments.''\nTo be sure, his central point is largely correct, though hardly the contrarian revelation he makes it out to be: Wall Street's corps of analysts, hedge fund operators, ratings agencies and all the rest should really have paid more attention to Enron's public disclosures.\n''They should have been able to scope it out,'' said Jonathan R. Macey, a law professor at Yale whose writings about Enron form the core of Mr. Gladwell's argument. Mr. Macey points out that it wasn't just laziness at work, either. Enron intimidated the big Wall Street investment banks to ensure that analysts had a buy rating on the stock. This point may be fresh to academia, but it's been made ad nauseam in the business press since the Enron fiasco.\nBut while Enron's dwindling cash flow, poor return on capital and so on suggested internal problems, there are lots of poorly performing companies with similar problems. They are not necessarily out-and-out frauds, as Enron was. And that's where Mr. Gladwell's argument falls apart. His view is that more disclosure, which is what the Securities and Exchange Commission tends to strive for, would not have made any difference. But what Mr. Skilling (and others, including Enron's founder, the late Kenneth L. Lay) were charged with was not hiding things in plain sight -- but hiding things out of sight that would have exposed the fraud. That is, they lied to the investing public about the true condition of the company. And no matter how you slice it, that's against the law.\nThe examples are myriad. Remember the Enron broadband business? The one that ''generated'' tens of millions in reported revenue even though it never generated much actual cash? Mr. Skilling was among the Enron executives who hid the true nature of the broadband business, in one notable instance by omitting remarks about its troubles that were included in a conference call script that had been prepared for him. There was simply no way for investors to know that the company was lying about that business, no matter how close they parsed the financials.\nOr how about the way Enron hid hundreds of millions of dollars in losses from its Enron Energy Services business by burying the division inside its profitable trading division? It did so, according to prosecutors -- and buttressed by much trial testimony -- because admitting the losses publicly would have raised huge alarms on Wall Street and caused the stock to tank. One of the things Mr. Skilling was convicted of was participating in that particular aspect of the Enron fraud.\nMr. Gladwell makes much of Enron's use of so-called special-purpose entities -- those supposed ''independent'' partnerships that were run by the company's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. Those entities, Mr. Gladwell argues, are incredibly complicated, and Enron's were more complex than most. Mr. Gladwell calls them examples of Enron's ''recklessness and incompetence,'' but not an example of inadequate disclosure. Even if Enron had publicly disclosed every page of every special-purpose entity, he says, it would have made no difference; they were just too convoluted.\nThis, however, is where he runs off the rails. Yes, the fact that the entities were run by ''a senior Enron executive'' is something that the company disclosed (usually in some buried footnote). And it should have raised a huge red flag. Shame on Wall Street for not picking up on it.\nBut Enron's S.P.E.'s were not always used for some legitimate purpose. Mostly, they were used to hide poorly performing assets and to launder loans as income. Not all of them were structured illegally, but many of them were -- a fact that Mr. Gladwell glosses over, and which Enron never disclosed publicly. Mr. Skilling, according to prosecutors, secretly guaranteed that Mr. Fastow's partnerships would never lose money in Enron assets, violating the law. It is also a reason Mr. Skilling is in prison now.\nThe point is not the sheer volume of disclosure; it's whether disclosure illuminates or obfuscates. Enron usually did the latter. In effect, Mr. Gladwell has conflated fraud with overvaluation. James Chanos, the short seller who first raised questions about Enron's numbers, told me that until the summer of 2001, when Mr. Skilling abruptly and inexplicably resigned, ''even I only thought it was a case of overstated earnings; that is all you could tell from their documents.'' He thought he would ride the stock down for a while, and then, eventually, cover his position once the market corrected for the overstatement. You could find plenty of evidence of overstated earnings in Enron's financial documents -- but you'd never know that the company was a Potemkin village. The kind of information that would have led to such a conclusion was precisely the information Enron hid from investors.\nAs his coup de grâce, Mr. Gladwell writes about a group of Cornell University business school students who looked closely at Enron financials in the spring of 1998, over two years before the fraud was exposed. According to Mr. Gladwell, the students concluded that Enron's business model was far riskier than its competitors. And they found ''clear signs'' that ''Enron may be manipulating its earnings.'' They put a sell recommendation on the stock, then at $48 a share.\nOut of curiosity, I looked up the students' work on the Internet. Their research report does indeed have a sell recommendation. But it's not really because the students thought Enron had deep problems. Indeed, the report praises much about Enron and its business. The main issue was a ''lack of upside potential in the near term.'' Over the long term, the students had a neutral rating on the stock. The students put a price target of $42 -- not exactly something you'd do if you suspected fraud.\nAs for that line about manipulating earnings, that's in the report, too, but it is also not quite as Mr. Gladwell makes it out to be. The students used a complex statistical tool called the Beneish model, which helps investors detect whether there might be some earnings manipulation. Sure enough, that is what the model suggested. But then the students went on: ''Further analysis of these indicators showed no cause for concern.''\nMr. Gladwell notwithstanding, my guess is that the students -- and the rest of the world -- would have come to a different conclusion if Enron had only disclosed what it should have. That it didn't has a lot to do with why Mr. Skilling is behind bars.\nTALKING BUSINESS
1816727	For Record-Setting Recruit, Full-Throated Praise and Whispered Doubts	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04EED71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Jimmy Clausen, one of the nation's top-rated high school football players, watched most of Notre Dame's dismal 41-14 loss to Louisiana State in the Sugar Bowl on Wednesday night.\nClausen, a quarterback who is scheduled to enroll early at Notre Dame this month, is here to play in Saturday's U.S. Army All-American Bowl, an annual gathering of the nation's elite prep seniors. He had talked to Notre Dame Coach Charlie Weis the previous day to offer encouragement to him and his future teammates.\n''It was a tough game for them,'' said Clausen of the Sugar Bowl loss, Notre Dame's ninth consecutive bowl defeat.\nWhen Clausen arrives at Notre Dame on Jan. 14, the question that will hover over his career will be whether he is the next Joe Montana or the next Ron Powlus. After putting up gaudy numbers at Oaks Christian School in Westlake Village, Calif., Clausen has been described as the ''LeBron James of high school football'' and ''The Chosen One'' from an early age.\nPowlus came to Notre Dame with similar hype in 1993 and, despite having a solid career, was viewed as a failure by many because he did not win multiple Heisman trophies as the ESPN analyst Beano Cook predicted.\nThere is an undercurrent of doubt about Clausen because of his attitude and a lack of high school competition. Some have questioned whether he was so dominant because, at 19, he was much older than his classmates and his opponents.\nClausen also drew criticism when he announced his decision to attend Notre Dame at a news conference in April at the College Football Hall of Fame in South Bend, Ind. He arrived in a stretch Hummer limousine, and many questioned just how collegiate in nature the whole production was.\nClausen shrugged off the criticism.\n''I've had pressure my whole life so it's nothing new to me,'' said Clausen, whose brothers, Casey and Rick, played quarterback at Tennessee.\nThere is no doubt Clausen handled the pressure against high school competition. During his three years as the starter there, he led Oaks Christian to a 42-0 record and threw 146 touchdown passes. Both are state records. In his senior year, he completed 69 percent of his passes for 3,428 yards and 49 touchdowns with only six interceptions, leading Oaks Christian to a 15-0 record and a state championship.\nAnd there is no doubting that the Irish's rabid fan base has been salivating over his arrival; he has been receiving e-mail messages and hand-written letters from the Irish zealots for months. Many will get their first chance the see Clausen on Saturday in the All-American Bowl, which will be the first of many appearances on NBC, the television network that broadcasts Notre Dame's home football games.\nThis week, many coaches and recruiting experts praised Clausen's play in the West team's practices and said that he has lived up to his high-profile billing.\nBut some of those people have also withheld criticism to avoid alienating the game's poster child.\nPrivately, they said they were disappointed by his pretentiousness, and they questioned if he had as much long-term potential as the 6-foot-6, 220-pound Ryan Mallett, a West team quarterback from Texarkana, Tex., who is headed to Michigan.\nWhen asked if he is a better quarterback than Clausen, Mallett said, ''We'll see how it goes Saturday.''\nScott Kennedy, director of national combines for Scout.com, which covers prep football recruiting, said Clausen was a more college-ready quarterback than Mallett and expected him to be the starter at Notre Dame by the end of next season. He said he had been impressed with Clausen's arm strength and mechanics this week and believed that the player was shy, not arrogant.\n''He's never going to live up to the expectations that some people have built for him,'' Kennedy said in a telephone interview. ''You can't judge him on his hype.''\nBut as impressive as Clausen's stats were this season, much of his success came against far less talented opponents. Oaks Christian, which this season had as many as 12 players who could sign N.C.A.A. Division I scholarships, defeated its opponents by an average score of 53-9.\nOaks Christian Coach Bill Redell, an assistant for the West team this week, defended his team's opponents, pointing out that it defeated nationally ranked St. Bonaventure of Ventura, Calif., 59-13.\n''I would say any freshman that could go into Notre Dame and start, it would be Jimmy Clausen,'' Redell said in a telephone interview. ''He has all the tools physically and mentally. He's way beyond his years.''\nIndeed, Clausen is already 19 and will turn 20 during his freshman season at Notre Dame. He started kindergarten at 6 and repeated sixth grade.\nHe is older than Arkansas quarterback Mitch Mustain and Georgia quarterback Matthew Stafford, who both played in the All-American Bowl last year and started several games during their freshman seasons in college.\nKennedy said he disagreed with critics who doubt Clausen's long-term ability.\n''To say that a 19-year-old kid can't get any better and use the term 'peak' is ridiculous,'' he said.\nClausen, who wears a shiny silver military-style dog tag bearing his No. 7 in fake diamonds, is undeterred by his detractors. He dismissed them with a smirk, saying they do not know him. ''People are going to say what they want to say,'' he said.\nHe said he liked hip-hop music, water skiing and snowboarding, but he maintained that his focus was on his future at Notre Dame.\nHe said Weis told him that he would have the chance to compete for the starting job against Evan Sharpley, who will be a junior, and Demetrius Jones and Zach Frazer, who will be entering their second year in the Irish program.\n''I'm going to do everything I can to start and help the team win and get to a national championship bowl game and win all that stuff,'' Clausen said.\nAnd that will ultimately decide if he is Notre Dame's next Joe Montana, or its next Ron Powlus.\nCOLLEGES
1816728	Schwarzenegger Opens in a Sequel	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00EED71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Nursing a broken leg but armed with an electoral mandate, Arnold Schwarzenegger was sworn in Friday to his second term as governor of California.\nThe ceremony, in a nearly full arena here in the state capital, came two months after Mr. Schwarzenegger's convincing victory over his Democratic challenger, Treasurer Phil Angelides, and two weeks after a painful fall on a ski trip to Sun Valley, Idaho, which shattered his right leg.\nBefore Friday, Mr. Schwarzenegger had not been seen in public since the accident and his resulting surgery, though photographs had shown the still-buff, preternaturally tan governor looking surprisingly meek in a hospital bed.\nSo the ceremony served both as a celebration and as a kind of group get-well card, complete with the kind of bipartisan oratory that usually marks the beginning -- and usually only the beginning -- of any governor's term.\n''There is an incredible change that has occurred here in Sacramento,'' said Willie L. Brown Jr., former San Francisco mayor and onetime Assembly speaker, who acted as the event's rakish master of ceremonies. ''Things are getting done. Over the last year it has been dramatically demonstrated, and California is better off for that effort.''\nLikewise, the inauguration was a chance for Mr. Schwarzenegger to take hold of the political center, something he did effectively during the election year -- the accomplishments included passage of a major bill on global warming and another raising the state's minimum wage -- and in the election itself, which the governor, a Republican in a predominantly Democratic state, won by drawing large numbers of voters across party lines.\n''We must think of ourselves as belonging not to just the Republican Party or the Democratic Party, but to the Party of California,'' he said in his inaugural speech, moments after taking the oath of office with his wife, Maria Shriver, at his side.\nThe bipartisanship was evident in the half-dozen prominent California Democrats on the stage at the Memorial Auditorium, a 3,800-seat arena just blocks from the Statehouse. Among them was Gray Davis, whom Mr. Schwarzenegger succeeded after a recall election in 2003.\nMr. Schwarzenegger has already begun to lay out an aggressive agenda for his second term. A major address is set for Monday in which he is expected to announce plans for a sweeping health care overhaul that may include providing medical coverage for 6.5 million uninsured Californians. His State of the State address will be on Tuesday, and the announcement of his budget on Wednesday.\nFriday's speech was devoted primarily to one topic -- centrism in what he called the ''nation state'' of California -- though he struck almost presidential chords when he began his address with references to the war in Iraq, a country he described as ''fertile with bloodshed and hate,'' and the killing in Darfur.\n''Faith and hope are two qualities that are in short supply in the world right now,'' he said. ''There are such deep divisions in our human family.''\nBy and large, however, the inauguration was a chance for supporters to enjoy the kind of pomp and star power that Californians have come to expect during Mr. Schwarzenegger's tenure. Jose Feliciano and Jennifer Holliday serenaded the governor at the ceremony, and a gala here Friday night featured Paul Anka and Donna Summer as headliners.\nBefore the swearing-in, a procession of multiethnic performers took the stage, including an Irish-style dance troupe, a mariachi band, a black gospel choir and a white youth choral group, who performed wearing flag-adorned sweaters and shirts.\nMati Waiya, a ceremonial leader of the Chumash Indian tribe, arrived at the inauguration bearing a condor and an eagle feather, which he said symbolized peace and dignity. Mr. Waiya, who also wore a bear bone through his nose, said he had worked with Mr. Schwarzenegger's transition team after the recall election and had been impressed by the governor's efforts on the environment and his willingness to differ with fellow Republicans.\n''I think he's serving both sides,'' Mr. Waiya said, ''but it's nice to see him get the Republicans a little upset.''\nIndeed, the two major speakers on Friday, other than the governor, were Democrats: Mr. Brown and Ms. Shriver, whose mother is Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of President John F. Kennedy. The elder Ms. Shriver, 85, drew a standing ovation as she took the stage.\nMr. Schwarzenegger got a few laughs during his address with his now-familiar comparison of his political career to his action-movie days. ''My escapes here have been more hair-raising than anything I've ever done in the movies,'' he said.\nBut Mr. Brown got the biggest laugh, when he said Maria Shriver, a former television reporter, had ''taken the role of the embedded journalist to the ultimate.'' Ms. Shriver seemed to enjoy the joke.\nMoments later, Mr. Brown went even further, calling Ms. Shriver ''foxy and sexy,'' something he said he would not have had the courage do if Mr. Schwarzenegger, still backstage before being introduced, had been closer at hand. Or not on crutches, for that matter.
1816729	New Diet Drug Is Approved With Pudgy Dogs in Mind	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403EED71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Too many dogs are lounging around at home all day while their owners work, then stuffing on table scraps in front of the television at night, so much so that veterinarians say there is an epidemic of canine obesity in this country.\nYesterday, the Food and Drug Administration announced one possible way to address the problem: the first prescription drug to treat obesity in dogs.\n''This is a welcome addition to animal therapies, because dog obesity appears to be increasing,'' said Dr. Stephen Sundlof, director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the food and drug agency, announcing the approval of the drug.\nVeterinarians define obese dogs as those that are 20 percent overweight. About 5 percent of dogs in the United States are obese, and another 20 precent to 30 percent are overweight, according to the drug agency. In all, Pfizer, the maker of the dog drug, called Slentrol, estimates that four million American dogs are obese and potential candidates for its therapy, which will cost $1 to $2 a day.\n''This is not a passport to abandon exercise or diets,'' said George J. Fennell, Pfizer's vice president in the United States for companion animal health. But Mr. Fennell said the drug would be a big help for dog owners who find it difficult to cut back on doggy treats.\n''You hear pet owners say: 'The dog really wags his tail when I give him a treat. It's hard to hold back,' '' Mr. Fennell said.\nThe epidemic of obesity in dogs mirrors a similar problem in humans in this country. And veterinarians say that humans are mostly to blame for fat dogs. ''People are treating their dogs like children,'' said Dr. Hal Taylor III, a veterinarian in Columbus, Ohio, who calls obesity one of the biggest health issues dogs face. ''They overindulge them, they get them heavy.'' Dr. Taylor has conducted research for Iams, the dog food manufacturer, to help find weight-loss food formulas.\nSlentrol is unlike any drug for human weight loss, but similar drugs have been studied as a way to reduce harmful fats in the blood of humans. The drugs were never marketed for people because of potential liver problems. In fact, the Slentrol label will carry a warning that it should not be used by people, and Pfizer said it should not be used for other pets.\nOne researcher who has studied the drugs said they could turn the liver into something resembling foie gras. Roger Davis, a heart researcher at San Diego State University who has no connection to the Pfizer product, said similar drugs might be used in the future by humans to reduce lipids in the blood, but only with another agent that blocks liver fat. Dr. Davis has been researching that drug combination.\nDr. S. Kristina Wahlstrom, a veterinarian and Pfizer executive, said liver problems were not an issue in dogs treated with Slentrol during the company's studies of 550 dogs. The primary side effect in dogs, she said, is vomiting.\nSlentrol is a liquid that can be added to a dog's food or placed directly in its mouth. The duration of treatment will depend on the amount of weight a dog needs to lose. In clinical studies of the drug, dogs on Slentrol lost about 3 percent of their weight a month, without changing their diets.\nThe problem of pudgy dogs has been cropping up more and more in veterinary clinics, where dogs are treated for cardiovascular problems, diabetes, torn ligaments, sores on their elbows, hip and back problems, and arthritis, all related to obesity. Some breeds, though, like beagles, dachshunds and Labrador retrievers, appear to be more prone to obesity than others.\nDeirdre Chiaramonte, a Manhattan veterinarian, said obesity caused particular problems for large dogs. ''They will get pressure sores, they will clearly be laying down a lot. They're going to have more arthritis because they're carrying around a lot of extra weight,'' she said.\nFor humans, an industry of diet centers, gyms and weight-loss doctors caters to a national obesity epidemic. Slentrol is part of a similar industry springing up for animals. Animal Medical Center in New York is considering an obesity program for dogs, using two underwater treadmills, Dr. Chiaramonte said.\nBut Dr. Taylor said he would emphasize diet and exercise for his dog patients and prescribe Slentrol only for the most obese and infirm, citing the hypothetical example of a 13-year-old dog with severe arthritis.\n''We can't stop people from eating Big Macs. We can dogs,'' he said. ''To me, the problem is very fixable.''
1816730	San Franciscans Hurl Their Rage At Parking Patrol	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02EED71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	It bears the hallmarks of a classic urban scourge: back-channel sales, assaults on enforcement officials and even death.\nIt is the price of parking in San Francisco.\nBurdened with one of the densest downtowns in the country and a Californian love for moving vehicles, San Franciscans have been shocked in recent months by crimes related to finding places to park, including an attack in September in which a young man was killed trying to defend a spot he had found.\nMore recently, the victims have been parking control officers -- do not call them meter maids -- who suffered four attacks in late November, and two officers went to a hospital.\nOver all, 2006 was a dangerous year for those hardy souls handing out tickets here, with 28 attacks, up from 17 in 2005.\nAll of which has left officials in this otherwise civilized community scrambling to explain, and solve, ''parking rage.''\n''It's hard for me to understand people reacting in such a hostile manner,'' said Nathaniel P. Ford Sr., executive director of the Municipal Transportation Agency, which oversees parking. ''Clearly, this is a working person simply doing their job. I've gotten parking tickets, and I sort of slap myself on the wrist and pay the ticket.''\nPeople in the field say abuse is common, often frightening and, occasionally, humiliating. In November, an officer was spat on, another was punched through the window of his Geo Metro, and an irate illegal parker smashed the windshield of another officer's golf-cart-like vehicle.\n''Just driving down the street, you get yelled at,'' said Lawanna Preston, staff director for Local 790 of the Service Employees International Union, which represents parking control officers.\nThe officers are city employees but not in the Police Department.\n''They can't even eat lunch with that uniform on, because people approach them and curse at them,'' Ms. Preston said.\nAbout 75 officers demonstrated on Friday at the Hall of Justice asking for more protection.\nPsychologists, planners and others familiar with the parking problems say they include underpriced meters and overloaded streets.\nOfficials have been looking into solutions to prevent attacks, including adding cameras to the officers' vehicles and pepper spray to their equipment, which now includes a flashlight, a radio and, of course, the ticket pad.\nDistrict Attorney Kamala D. Harris said she was considering lobbying the state to increase the penalties for attacking parking officers.\nA public service announcement warning against violence against ticket writers is to start appearing on buses this month.\nLast month, the police announced the arrest of a second suspect in the killing of Boris Albinder, 19, on Sept. 16 near Golden Gate Park as he tried to save a parking space for a friend by standing in it. The authorities say Mr. Albinder was attacked by a group of men in a van who demanded that he cede the space.\nMany local planners say the lack of parking is in part an unfortunate byproduct of the city's popularity.\n''Any city that is worth visiting is going to have a terrible parking problem,'' said Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, a public policy center. ''If you don't want it to be Disneyland or Houston, you're going to be experiencing a parking shortage.''\nMr. Metcalf added, however, that the density of San Francisco, with an estimated 740,000 residents in 49 square miles, also put in a different category from New York, which is also known for its parking nightmares.\n''It's too dense for people to drive easily and not dense enough for really great public transit,'' he said. ''So the result is frustration.''\nThat opinion was seconded by Donald Shoup, a professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles, widely considered something of a parking theory guru. (His fans are called Shoupistas.)\nProfessor Shoup said the chronic lack of parking here was a result of a decision to encourage a bustling downtown free of atmosphere-killing parking lots, a phenomenon echoed in other parking-challenged -- and popular -- cities like Boston, Chicago and New York.\n''Whenever someone from San Francisco calls to whine about the fact there's no parking,'' he said, ''I always say, 'Well, you have to choose, do you want to be more like San Francisco or more like L.A.?' And that usually ends the conversation.''\nThat said, Professor Shoup noted that San Francisco had some questionable parking policies, namely cheap on-street parking and expensive garages and lots, a dynamic that encourages drivers to look endlessly for meters rather than pay for the privilege of parking off the street.\n''A lot of the traffic in downtown San Francisco is people looking for curb parking,'' he said. ''And they're apparently so fed up that they're willing to assault parking officers to protest the idea of shortage of spaces.''\nThat frustration extends all the way to people like George Anderson, president of the American Association of Anger Management Providers, a mental health group, who said the parking problems here were so notorious that he had stopped holding paid lectures here.\n''They'd be angry when they walked in,'' said Mr. Anderson, a clinical social worker who lives in Los Angeles. ''I'd spend half my time defending why I couldn't include parking in the fee.''\nMr. Anderson said that his anger management patients regularly complained about the road and that not finding parking could be the last straw.\n''If you're driving on a highway,'' he said, ''you're already stressed to the max. So that by the time you get to the parking stall, you end up with an inappropriate expression of anger.''\nMs. Preston of the officers' union said many attackers had another motivation.\n''They think they can take out their frustration on government in general'' by abusing the officers, who work 40-hour weeks for about $40,000 a year,'' she said, adding, ''They say, 'I'm tired of the city taking my money.' ''\nThere certainly is money in parking tickets. San Francisco issues 1.9 million parking citations and brings in more than $40 million a year from violators, according to the transportation agency.\nThe city has a pilot program to scan license plates for 8,000 repeat offenders who owe an estimated $6.1 million. In addition, the city manages 41 lots and garages. It owns most of them.\nNationally, parking is a $20 billion industry, experts say, with revenues divided almost equally between public and private entities.\nPrivate citizens have also gotten into the act, selling or trading spaces on Web sites like Craigslist, where a prime spot can bring in thousands of dollars a year.\nWhitney Schmucker, 22, who lives on Nob Hill, has just agreed to pay $280 a month for a spot after advertising herself online. (''Great credit!'' was a lure.)\n''If you live in San Francisco, it's not a choice of whether or not you get a parking spot,'' Ms. Schmucker said in an e-mail message. ''You either get one or you don't have a car.''\nParking bloggers like John Van Horn, an editor in Los Angeles who compiles thoughts about parking on the Web site parkingtoday.typepad.com said the situation -- and the attacks -- in San Francisco were not unique but merely a reminder of how crazed Californians can be about all things automotive.\n''I've noticed lately watching some of the citation writers,'' Mr. Van Horn said. ''They don't get very far away from their vehicles. They want to be able to get away.''
1816731	Goal Is to Look Good, Writer of Democratic Memoir Admits	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DEED71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Most memoirs -- and virtually all memoirs by people in politics -- are heavily varnished and blatantly self-serving. Say this for Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic Party chairman and fund-raiser extraordinaire: at least he admits it right up front in his author's note.\n''This is my book and I've done my best to make myself look good,'' he writes in his new memoir with the ungainly title, ''What a Party! My Life Among Democrats: Presidents, Candidates, Donors, Activists, Alligators and Other Wild Animals'' (Thomas Dunne Books).\n''Even if you think I'm full of it, I bet I can still make you laugh.''\nThere are any number of humorous anecdotes sprinkled among the chest-deep pile of dropped names in the 406-page volume, including Yasir Arafat's repeatedly rubbing Mr. McAuliffe's leg under the table at a dinner in Washington in 2000 and the South Korean secret police's warning the White House in 1998 that President Bill Clinton had spent most of the night in a hotel room in Seoul with ''a good-looking younger man.'' That younger man was Mr. McAuliffe, who had been up late playing cards with his buddy the president.\nAnd he shares the tale of getting up on stage half-plastered at the Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut to sing ''Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?'' to nail down a $500,000 contribution from the chief of the Mashantucket Pequot Indians. There are two sections of photographs, a portable version of the Washington Power Wall, displaying the author with all manner of celebrities and potentates: Jimmy Carter, Kevin Spacey, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., Richard A. Gephardt, Pope John Paul II, Al Gore, Chris Tucker and Cicely Tyson, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Olivia Newton-John, Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry, Ariel Sharon, King Juan Carlos of Spain, Mikhail Baryshnikov.\nAnd a Washington memoir would not be complete without a little old-school score settling, in this case with Mr. Kerry, who lost the 2004 presidential campaign despite what Mr. McAuliffe portrays as his own Herculean efforts.\nMr. Kerry's biggest blunder, in Mr. McAuliffe's account, was to forbid any attacks on President Bush from the lectern at the 2004 Democratic convention. Mr. McAuliffe calls that decision ''one of the biggest acts of political malpractice in the history of American politics.''\nHe also knocks Mr. Kerry for not responding forcefully to the Swift boat group's attacks on his military record and for hoarding money at the end of his campaign, ending the contest with a surplus of $15 million that Mr. McAuliffe believes would have made the difference in Ohio, the decisive state.\nDavid Wade, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, said that his boss was grateful for Mr. McAuliffe's ''incredible'' efforts in the 2004 campaign and that he wished the outcome had been different. But, Mr. Wade added, ''it's time to look forward, not backwards.''\nMr. McAuliffe, reached on the golf course at the Army-Navy Club in Arlington, Va., on Friday afternoon said, ''Kerry and I went through all these issues, and he agrees with me on every one.''\nHe added, before teeing off with Mr. Clinton, ''I say a lot of nice things about Kerry in the book, too.''
1816732	With Each Fallen Soldier, a Field of Flags Grows	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEED71430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The flags are cut from rolls of yellow plastic tablecloth, then woven onto thin wire rods. Each is about as long as a man's size 7 shoe, as wide as an outstretched hand.\nThey stand on a sloped corner field framed by a row of conifer trees in this upstate hamlet, spreading in concentric circles like ripples on still water.\nFrom afar, the flags look like clumsily painted dots, an amateur installation of elusive meaning. A closer look yields a clue: a laminated sign with bold black numbers that match the number of flags on the field, numbers that climb almost by the day.\nOn Sunday, there were 3,000 yellow flags on the ground. By Thursday, five more.\n''Just imagine if instead of flags, there were soldiers standing here,'' Caren Crootof said as she walked across the field, replacing flags torn or toppled by rain and wind.\nMrs. Crootof, 54, makes the flags, cutting the plastic with scissors at her kitchen table. She plants them most mornings before going to work as a midwife, on the one-acre plot next to the 19th-century farmhouse where she and her husband raised three children. First, she checks a Web site that provides a daily tally of the number of American soldiers killed in the war in Iraq. Then she takes to the field, updates the sign and plants the flags.\nIt started in July 2004, with 877 flags.\n''We all grieved the losses of 9/11, we all shared the pain of those families that lost loved ones in the attacks,'' Mrs. Crootof said. ''But here we were, losing all this potential, losing heroes who threw their bodies on grenades to save other troops, and I felt that we, as a nation, were doing so little to acknowledge them.\n''I just felt compelled to do something,'' she added, ''and this is what I could do.''\nThe field of flags is at once poignant and terrifying, plain yet powerful for those who have taken notice in this out-of-the-way town of 2,300 in northeastern New York State. The Crootofs' field sits at the end of Middle Line Road, which slices through a landscape of rolling hills, silos and grazing cattle. It is just off Route 29, next door to Saratoga Springs.\nOne recent morning, a truck driver passing by flashed a thumbs-up sign to Mrs. Crootof, who stood in the field like a dark speck on a yellow-gold sea. A few minutes later, a van rolled past the field and its driver honked twice as he steered around the bend.\nJust as the van disappeared, Bruce Houser pulled up in a sport utility vehicle and snapped a picture. He first spotted the flags some months ago, while traveling the road on business, but drove back this week, 30 miles from his home in Speigletown, to mark the milestone of 3,000 dead soldiers.\n''These flags here, they're a stark reminder of what the war really means,'' Mr. Houser said.\nAnkie Meuwissen, 30, who lives opposite Mrs. Crootof, said people often stopped and stared for a moment -- mothers with children in tow, working men, couples young and old.\n''I don't know if wonderful is the most appropriate word to describe it,'' Ms. Meuwissen said, ''but it's nice that somebody is doing something to remind us what we're giving up in this war.''\nLast Memorial Day, Mrs. Crootof's daughter, Rebecca, 25, heard taps being played as she was eating breakfast on the sun porch. She stepped outside to find a man playing the piece on a trumpet while standing atop a knoll overlooking the field.\nWhat started as a simple exercise in remembrance has become a vast daily vigil for Mrs. Crootof, a self-professed leftist who has taken part in boisterous antiwar protests in New York City and more subdued ones among her neighbors here.\nShe abhors the war, but sees the flags as nothing more than a heartfelt way of honoring the troops and sharing the grief of their families.\nIt is a laborious, tedious task of bending, of burying the rods in the ground. Mrs. Crootof often has help -- from her children, who come home during college breaks; from her aging parents, who live nearby; from friends and strangers.\nHer husband, Mark, a veterinarian, and their son, Aaron, 18, mow the field in the warm months to keep the wild grass from obscuring the flags; a local 4-H club has offered to take on that task come spring. In the summer of 2005, nine girls from Girl Scout Troop 299 in Ballston Lake, about 15 miles to the south, made 100 flags to replace tattered ones.\n''The thing is, we all tend to just go along with our everyday life and forget what's going on in Iraq,'' said Suzanne DeVito, the troop leader at the time. ''But when you look at this field and when you step on it and you walk around it, the war becomes very real because you remember that it's not about bombs and tanks. It's about people like you and I.''
1816733	City Takes Aim at Illegal Ads on Sidewalk Sheds	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E7D61430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Since $2,500 fines against building owners have done little in the past to stop the proliferation of illegal advertising on sidewalk construction sheds in Manhattan, the Bloomberg administration is getting ready this month to battle the signs themselves.\n''We'll cover them up,'' said Patricia J. Lancaster, commissioner of the Buildings Department.\nThe city already has a contractor, Van Wagner Communications, that will place solid-colored vinyl sheets over offending ads if they are not removed by the owners after a 10-day warning period.\nWord of the impending crackdown has circulated for months, with Ms. Lancaster reminding building owners in a letter last year that ''advertising signs on sidewalk sheds are always illegal.'' As a result, the effort is already showing results.\nWhere Buildings Department inspectors found 62 illegal signs in October, only 3 remained as of yesterday, the agency said.\n(So if you had a sense that many of those long plywood construction shed parapets have recently regained their blank appearance after serving as billboards, it was not your imagination.)\n''The industry has voluntarily removed all the advertising on the sidewalk sheds -- I can't say without threat from the city, don't get me wrong,'' said Richard M. Schaps, the chairman and chief executive of Van Wagner, a leading outdoor advertising company. He said Van Wagner had already taken down sidewalk shed advertising that it controlled.\nMs. Lancaster said she was encouraged by the voluntary compliance, but was prepared to go further. Besides covering up advertising, the agency may post pictures of illegal signs on its Web site in what the commissioner called a ''shame campaign.''\nAmong the offenders cited last year by the agency was a blocklong shed at the base of the new New York Times Building on Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets, which carried advertising for AT&T. The parapets are now painted solid blue and gray.\n''Our ad came down as soon as it was clear there was a violation,'' said Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Forest City Ratner Companies, which is developing the building with The New York Times Company.\nAnother enormous sign removed recently was an advertisement for Sovereign Bank that wrapped 300 feet around the 500 Fifth Avenue tower at 42nd Street, where there is no branch of the bank. The shed is now blank.\n''Obviously, we weren't aware of the ordinance,'' said Edward J. Shultz, the director of corporate communications at Sovereign. ''Had we been, we wouldn't have placed the advertising. We take ordinances very seriously.''\nThe city defines an advertising sign as one that ''directs attention to goods and services at a location other than where the sign is located.'' That is different from a sign related to a business on the site or a noncommercial sign.\nBorough President Scott M. Stringer of Manhattan, who has battled illegal signs for years, welcomed the crackdown. ''To have a forceful response from the Buildings Department means a lot to communities, especially in Manhattan,'' he said.\nThis month, inspectors will issue notices of violation where they find signs they deem to be illegal, the agency said, like the ad for the new ABC Family series ''Lincoln Heights'' that wraps around 1095 Avenue of the Americas, between 41st and 42nd Streets, and the ad for ''The Color Purple,'' at Broadway and 46th Street. They will give owners 10 days to take down the signs themselves.\nOwners will be liable for all costs.\nVan Wagner will serve as the city's contractor if enforcement reaches the point of actually covering up ads. ''I'm hoping that doesn't have to take place,'' Mr. Schaps said.\nMr. Schaps said Van Wagner had a strong interest in enforcement, feeling that it is unfair to have to compete with illegal operators. ''If there are rules, we comply,'' he said. ''The thing that's difficult for us is when outdoor advertising companies do not comply with regulations.''\nCommissioner Lancaster said there was ''enough culpability'' to go around. ''Outdoor ad companies that hire sign hangers are one party,'' she said, ''and the owners of buildings that derive tremendous income are another party, and the advertisers themselves.''\nShe traced the city's new enforcement efforts to a moment last spring. ''The signs had become more and more egregious,'' she recalled, ''and they proliferated almost as though they were breeding at night.''\nIf the sidewalk shed initiative is successful, she said, ''we'll do scaffolds next.''
1816734	With Mild Winter, the City Revisits Fall Fashion and the Record Books	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E7D61430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The last recorded time the snowfall in Central Park came so late in the season, the date was Jan. 4, 1878.\nRutherford B. Hayes was president, the tallest building in the city was Trinity Church (281 feet), and there was no Statue of Liberty. (It was erected in 1886.)\nIn a sense, there was no New York, either. The boroughs consolidated in 1898. Before then, the Bronx was called the Annexed District, Queens was farms, Staten Island was nearly empty, and Brooklyn was the nation's third-largest city.\nYesterday, with parts of the nation shivering and the Rockies and the Midwest pummeled by another snowstorm, the record for the latest appearance of snow in New York City was broken with little fanfare.\nFor now, not even a flurry is in the immediate forecast. Indeed, today the temperature might reach 71 degrees, which would be another record. According to the National Weather Service, it will not even come close to freezing until Tuesday night, when the temperature could go down to 30 degrees.\nFor many people interviewed yesterday -- a warm day of mist and gray skies -- the city without snow was both a bewilderment and a delight.\nThere was scarcely a fedora, a knit cap or a hoodie to be seen. Therese Kahn, an interior decorator on the Upper East Side, was wearing what she described as ''comfortable'' Stuart Weitzman patent-leather boots, rather than Gore-Tex snow boots.\n''It's amazing that it's so nice,'' said Ms. Kahn, 50, who also had on a thin white parka, unzipped. ''I have two teenage daughters and I'm always worried that they're not dressed warmly enough, so this lifts the pressure.''\nJan Khan, 53, has been a doorman at 88 Central Park West for 21 years. ''This is the first year I see no snow coming down,'' he said. ''I don't like it. It's not normal.''\nMr. Khan, originally from Mansehra, in northern Pakistan, said winter was invading usually warmer countries of Asia. On Thursday, more than 30 people were reported dead in Madhya Pradesh, in central India, and at least 20 in Bihar, in northeastern India, because of a severe cold snap.\n''In Pakistan that is the problem now,'' Mr. Khan said. ''Two feet, three feet of snow. The Arctic is happening in my country, and India and Bangladesh and Nepal and China, all under snow.''\nIn East Harlem, at the Three Kings Day Parade, which commemorates the arrival of the Magi in Bethlehem, Carlos Canales, 36, from Glendale, Queens, worried about the weather.\n''People aren't really ready for the winter anymore,'' he said. ''We're going to get caught off guard when winter finally hits us and a lot of people are going to get sick.''\nNearby, in Central Park, Patrick Denehan, 36, a furniture mover from Washington Heights, sipped coffee and watched geese waddle near an ice-free Harlem Meer.\n''It feels,'' Mr. Denehan said, ''like the Twilight Zone.''\nThere is one positive aspect to the warm weather: the pothole situation. The city's Department of Transportation said that work crews paved 17,357 potholes last month, about a quarter fewer than the 22,685 during the much snowier December of 2005.\nIn December 1877, when The New York Times took note of the snowless Christmas, the day was described as crisp and sunny.\nThe headline said, ''A MILD CHRISTMAS DAY -- THOUSANDS OF PERSONS IN THE CENTRAL PARK.''\nThe Times account read, ''It is estimated, and the estimate is thought to be moderate, that fully 50,000 persons were in the Park during the afternoon, nearly all of whom visited the new Museum, opened by the President on Saturday.''\nThe Times noted, however, that the weather did hurt certain businesses. ''Dry-goods houses, clothiers and coal dealers have been the heaviest sufferers,'' the newspaper said. ''They have seen their Winter's supplies lie on their hands almost undiminished.''\nWhen snow finally fell for the first time that winter in Central Park on Jan. 4, 1878, The Times did not report it. The newspaper did say that Poughkeepsie had four inches of snow.\nThe National Weather Service was cautious yesterday about how snowless is snowless. Jeffrey Tongue, science and operations officer at the service's Upton office on Long Island, said the Jan. 4, 1878, date is based on the best available records.\n''When we're talking about a snow flurry that might last 10 minutes,'' Mr. Tongue said, ''there's a question whether those were fully documented. We believe the 1878 date is accurate, but of course there's nobody alive to actually ask about it.''\nStephen Fybish, an amateur weather historian, contends that the record for late snow in Central Park occurred far later than 1878, indeed nearly a century later, on Jan. 29, 1973.\n''This is also true,'' said Mr. Tongue of the weather service. ''The 1878 date is for a trace of snow, which doesn't stick to the ground, and the 1973 date is for measurable snow, which was 1.8 inches.''\nSo, whether the start date for the snowless record should be Jan. 5 or Jan. 30 is a matter of keen scholarly interest.\nBut, please, the weather service urges, no wagering.
1816735	Higher Pay Is Set For Transit Chief	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E7D61430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	The new leader of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will be paid $42,000 more than his predecessor, a raise that is justified because he will have a wider role in running the agency and shaping policy, a spokesman for Gov. Eliot Spitzer said yesterday.\nElliot G. Sander, who started work this week as the executive director and chief executive of the authority, will receive a salary of $265,000 and a housing allowance of $60,000, according to Christine Anderson, the press secretary for Governor Spitzer, who chose Mr. Sander to run the agency. Mr. Sander will also receive $15,000 in deferred compensation, in the form of payments into a personal retirement account, bringing his total compensation to $340,000 a year.\nThe previous executive director, Katherine N. Lapp, received a salary of $235,000, a housing allowance of $48,000 and a deferred payment of $15,000, for a total pay of $298,000.\nThe words ''chief executive'' have been added to Mr. Sander's title, and his role will include some of the duties previously handled by the authority's chairman, whose unpaid position has had a prominent decision-making function.\n''His duties are expanding and he's taking more on than his predecessor,'' Ms. Anderson said of Mr. Sander and the 14 percent pay raise. Mr. Sander will make more than Governor Spitzer, who is paid $179,000 a year, according to the office of the state comptroller.\nBut he will earn less than the executives of some other transit agencies around the country. The new general manager of the Washington, D.C., transit system will make more than $375,000 a year, a spokeswoman said.
1816736	Verizon to Announce Plan For TV Shows on Cellphones	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E7D61430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Verizon Wireless is expected to announce on Sunday that it will offer full-length programming to its cellular subscribers from several major television networks, according to people apprised of the deal.\nThe service, which should be in operation by the end of March, will consist of eight channels and will include popular shows from NBC, CBS, Fox and MTV, they said. ESPN is reportedly also in negotiations to offer programs, which will be offered for the cellphone screen soon after they appear on television.\nWhat is significant is that the programs will be among the first full-length television shows to be offered to cellular subscribers in the United States. In Europe, where mobile phone technology is more advanced, such programming is more widely available.\nIt will also make the mobile phone more competitive with devices like the iPod from Apple Computer. In 2005, Apple announced that it would offer shows from the Walt Disney Company's ABC network for sale through its iTunes Store. Other entertainment companies quickly followed suit.\nMedia companies will receive a fee based on consumer subscriptions. A spokesman for Verizon Wireless could not be reached for comment on Friday evening.\nIn the deal, Verizon is joining with MediaFLO U.S.A., a subsidiary of Qualcomm, which has created technology to transmit high-resolution video through its own dedicated network. MediaFLO's quality rivals European and Asian standards, media executives say.\nVerizon Wireless and Qualcomm have been partners for some time; they first announced an agreement to work together in 2005. MediaFLO was reported by those apprised of the Verizon deal to be in talks to offer television shows through other wireless phone companies as well.\nSamsung and LG are two phone makers whose equipment is compatible with the MediaFLO network.
1816737	First Baby of 2007? Toy Chain's Prize Runs Afoul of the Immigration Issue	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D61430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	It seemed like a perfect formula for good publicity: A national sweepstakes would award a $25,000 United States savings bond to the first American baby born in 2007, courtesy of the toy chain Toys ''R'' Us and its Babies ''R'' Us division.\nInstead, after disqualifying a Chinese-American baby girl born in New York Downtown Hospital at the stroke of midnight on New Year's, the toy company finds itself caught in the glare of the immigration debate, stumbling over the nation's new demographic realities.\nThe baby girl, Yuki Lin, was an American citizen from the second the ball dropped in Times Square, where the Toys ''R'' Us flagship store draws thousands of shoppers from around the world. But like 6 out of 10 babies born in the city -- including at least two others born in Brooklyn about the same moment -- she has immigrant parents. And according to the contest's fine print, the chain decided, she was ruled out because her mother was not a legal resident.\nThe first baby of the year is usually a one-day story. But Albert H. Wang, a corporate lawyer who read about Yuki Lin's lost chance on the Web site of the Chinese-language newspaper The World Journal, was outraged enough to start an e-mail campaign that is enlisting the ire of prominent Chinese-Americans like the president of the Asian American Business Development Center and officers of the Organization of Chinese Americans.\nTheir criticism, and threats of a media campaign against the company, come just a month after the chain opened its first store in China, in Shanghai.\n''They want business from China,'' said Mr. Wang, 39, adding that most of the chain's toys are made by Chinese workers in China. ''But when it comes to this Chinese-American U.S. citizen, she was deprived of $25,000 intended to be used for her college education, because of who her parents are.''\nKathleen Waugh, a spokeswoman for the company, confirmed yesterday that Yuki Lin, born at 6.5 pounds and 19 inches long, had been close to winning the prize. The baby won a random drawing to break a three-way tie with hospitals in Gainesville, Ga., and Bay Shore, N.Y., which also claimed a baby born at midnight.\nBut, Ms. Waugh added, ''in working with New York Downtown Hospital to verify the potential winner's information and obtain a signed affidavit of eligibility -- which is required under the official rules of the sweepstakes -- the sweepstakes administrator was informed that the mother of the baby born at New York Downtown Hospital was not a legal resident of the United States.'' Contest rules say that only mothers who are legal residents are eligible, Ms. Waugh said, adding that such requirements are common in sweepstakes.\nThe award went instead to the runner-up in the drawing, Jayden Swain, born 19 seconds after midnight at Northeast Georgia Medical Center to Renee Swain, 20, described by her mother as ''a black American.'' ''She's an American all the way,'' Ms. Swain's mother, Janet K. Keller, said in a telephone interview.\nThe baby at Bay Shore was born to a couple from El Salvador.\nMr. Wang and other Chinese-Americans say the winner was to be the baby, not the mother, and they see implications of second-class citizenship that strike an ugly chord. It only seemed to add insult to injury, they said, that the baby was instead given a $100 gift basket, just like all the others the chain gives to the first New Year's babies born in any hospital that signs up for it.\n''People are just pretty much outraged,'' said John Wang, president of the 13-year-old Asian American Business Development Center, on Wall Street, adding that he was perplexed by the company's actions.\n''The schools accept children whose parents are illegal aliens in this country, so why is Toys 'R' Us taking this kind of position?'' he asked. ''They're supported by many people, whether they're legal or illegal, shopping in their stores, and they're injecting themselves into this debate.''\nThe parents could not be reached for comment, and their exact immigration status was unclear. Vanessa Warner, a spokeswoman for New York Downtown Hospital, would not answer questions about the event, though an upbeat account of the birth and photos of the parents and medical team were on the hospital Web site yesterday. The mother is Han Lin and the father is Yan Zhu Liu, both 22-year-old restaurant workers.\nLeo Y. Lee, 49, an engineer who is past national vice president of the Organization of Chinese Americans, an advocacy organization, pointed out that the savings bond was awarded in the name of the baby, not the mother, and that there was no legal requirement for a rule barring the American-born child of an illegal immigrant.\n''I am strongly opposed to the Toys 'R' Us decision to give the award to another baby just based solely on the mother's status,'' he said. His group, he said, does not ''condone or approve illegal immigration, but anyone who is here should be protected by law -- especially a baby with the same rights as any other citizen.''\nBut comments by Ms. Keller, the grandmother of the winning baby, hinted at the wrath that the company risked from the other side at a time when the most stringent critics of illegal immigration have called for an end to birthright citizenship, saying the children born to illegal immigrants are ''anchor babies'' who encourage illegal entry.\n''If she's an illegal alien, that makes the baby illegal,'' said Ms. Keller, 50. Told otherwise, she remarked, ''Sounds like a double standard to me,'' adding, ''She was disqualified -- that should be it. Don't go changing your mind now.''\nAdding to the confusion were promotional materials that called for ''all expectant New Year's mothers'' to apply to the contest, and allowed hospitals and Ob/Gyn offices to apply on behalf of their patients. The hospitals were offered a chance to win a $10,000 prenatal education grant. About 8,000 mothers and more than 800 hospitals participated in the contest, Ms. Waugh said.\nOle Pedersen, a spokesman for Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in Brooklyn, said the hospital initially believed it had won the sweepstakes with the midnight birth of Odunayo Muhammed to a Nigerian immigrant couple, Christiana and Abdul Muhammed. Later he learned that the doctor who reported the birth online had missed the contest's 6 a.m. deadline on Jan. 1 by an hour and a half.\nAs for a mother's legal status, Mr. Pedersen added, ''We wouldn't have even thought of that.''\nCorrection: January 11, 2007, Thursday An article on Saturday about a controversy over a national sweepstakes awarding a $25,000 savings bond to the first American baby born in 2007 gave an erroneous birth weight in some copies for a Chinese-American girl, born in Manhattan, who was disqualified because her mother was not a legal resident. The girl, Yuki Lin, weighed 6.5 pounds, not 6.5 ounces. (The sponsor of the sweepstakes, Toys ''R'' Us, has since reversed its decision and awarded Yuki and two other babies born shortly after midnight $25,000 each.)
1816738	Eagles Look to the Past To Bring Future Success	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E6D61430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	When the phone rang Monday morning, Koy Detmer let his answering machine pick up.\nWho would call at 8 a.m. on New Year's Day?\nA half-hour later, Detmer's wife, Katie, listened to the message at the family's home in San Antonio: The Eagles were calling. It seemed urgent.\nThe Eagles?\nDetmer had been cut at the end of training camp. Jeff Garcia and A. J. Feeley had been preferred as Philadelphia's backup quarterbacks to Donovan McNabb.\nDirk Johnson, the punter, took over Detmer's job as the holder on field goals and extra points. Detmer was out of organized football, working for a real estate investing firm and helping train high school quarterbacks.\n''It was completely out of the blue for me,'' Detmer said of the call.\nHe had not watched Philadelphia's regular-season finale last Sunday, during which David Akers, one of the N.F.L.'s most reliable kickers, clanged a 23-yard field-goal attempt off the goal post during the Eagles' 24-17 victory against Atlanta.\nFor the first time in 50 career attempts, Akers had missed a field goal inside 30 yards. It was symptomatic of a slight dip in his dependability. Akers had been accurate on only 18 of 23 field-goal attempts (78 percent), a career-low percentage for a 16-game season in which he had more than six attempts.\nPhiladelphia had a new long snapper and a new holder. Perhaps that helped explain the drop-off. In any case, the Eagles were taking no chances, with Sunday's playoff opener against the Giants approaching and hopes of making the Super Bowl appearing legitimate.\nWould Detmer lend his hands as a holder during the playoffs? Coach Andy Reid wanted to know.\nNo problem, Detmer said.\nNot that he had much to pack for the trip to Philadelphia from Texas.\nDetmer is one of the most unaffected and frugal of all professional athletes.\nIn nine previous seasons in Philadelphia, he generally carried nothing on trips but a toothbrush. Each season, he bought one outfit to wear to away games, spending no more than $100.\nUsually, he said, he could buy the whole ensemble, shoes to shirt, for $60. Spending $100 was considered a shopping spree.\nIf Detmer enjoyed any extravagance, it was his famous abundance of neck hair and his vigorous touchdown theatrics known as the whip.\nBut the Eagles did not want him back for his frugality, scruffiness or inscrutable celebrations. They wanted his hands.\n''You've got a guy out there who can do it as well as anyone can do it and he's available,'' Jim Harbaugh, the Eagles' special-teams coach, said of re-signing Detmer as a holder. ''That can make us better in one little area that could be the difference. Why not do it?''\nA field-goal attempt takes about one second from the snap to the kick. It remains one of the most elementary but technically precise and vital functions in the sport. Four of Philadelphia's games were decided by 3 points or fewer this season. A successful field goal could mean the difference between victory or defeat in the playoffs.\n''You only get one chance to do it right,'' Detmer said.\nKickers can be extremely fastidious. But what the left-footed Akers wants most from a holder is consistency. He did not request Detmer's return, he said, but he knows that after six seasons working together, Detmer will provide comfortable uniformity.\nDetmer will tilt the ball slightly toward the goal posts, and sideways at something less than 45 degrees. And he is familiar with the vagaries of the wind at Lincoln Financial Field.\nIf the wind is blowing left to right, Detmer compensates by tilting the ball more toward himself. If the wind is blowing right to left, he tilts the ball away from himself. The stiffer the headwind, the more the ball is rotated forward. ''It's so technical; people have no idea,'' Akers said.\nPreviously, Detmer worked with Mike Bartrum as the Eagles' long snapper. But Bartrum sustained a neck injury this season, so Philadelphia signed Jon Dorenbos as his replacement. Dorenbos's snap stroke is slightly shorter and quicker than Bartrum's, Detmer said, which required some adjusting to. But Akers was successful on 46 of 49 attempts at practice Tuesday, so apparently the three have found a rhythm.\n''I just try to be as smooth and rhythmical as I can to give Dave a good clean picture,'' Detmer said. ''Letting him see the same thing every time -- not jerky or fumbly.''\nBut there is one wrinkle. If the Eagles win Sunday, they will travel to New Orleans next week, and Detmer has not bought an outfit for the road.\n''I'll have to pick something out with my new bonus check,'' he said.\nPRO FOOTBALL\nCorrection: January 9, 2007, Tuesday A sports article on Saturday about the former quarterback Koy Detmer, who was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to be the holder on kicks in the playoffs, misidentified the special-teams coach. He is John Harbaugh, not Jim Harbaugh. (The Harbaughs are brothers. Jim was recently hired as head coach at Stanford University.)
1816739	Grand-Scale Lawn Art Stirs a Debate in Connecticut	2007-01-06	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E6D61430F935A35752C0A9619C8B63	Talk about making waves.\nTempers are flaring in this town's historic Southport district over a 40-ton, wavelike sculpture made of concrete, steel and lead that for the last few years has been resting just behind a row of shrubs on the front lawn of a waterfront estate.\nThe town's Historic District Commission insists that the 80-foot-long, 4-foot-high recumbent object meets the legal test for a structure and requires a certificate of appropriateness.\nBut the owners of the sculpture, Andrew and Christine Hall, disagree, and both they, and their huge artwork by the internationally renowned artist Anselm Kiefer, have stood their ground.\nIn 2005, a superior court judge in Stamford sided with the town but delayed enforcing the ruling so that it could be appealed. Now, the Connecticut Supreme Court has swooped in and indicated that it wants to hear the case next month -- before the state's appellate division had the chance to act.\nThe artwork causing the stir is titled, ''Etroits sont les vaisseaux,'' or ''Narrow are the vessels.'' Hardly visible from the street, it is far less conspicuous than some of the other contemporary artworks scattered across the 3.5-acre Greek Revival homestead, built in the 1840s by Oliver H. Perry, a former speaker of Connecticut's House of Representatives.\nOne work, a blue-and-orange totemish kind of pole, sits on the front steps of the home in sharp contrast with the imposing all-white facade. Another work, painted to look like a Volkswagen Beetle, winks at visitors from the driveway. And a neon-lighted sculpture that the neighbors have taken to calling ''The Neon Cafe'' shines from inside the house on nights when the couple is home.\nThe Halls declined through their lawyer at Robinson & Cole, Edward V. O'Hanlan, to comment. And while the local commission has not taken kindly to the 40-ton wave, neighbors interviewed this week generally supported the couple and chastised the town for wasting legal fees on something that they feel is no bother.\n''Of all the things in the world to complain about, art should not be one of them,'' said Barbara Geddis, a local architect.\nNeighbors also said that had it not been for the legal challenge Mr. Hall, a veteran commodities trader and top executive at Phibro, which is part of Citigroup, would have sent the artwork to a museum and rotated another in its place.\n''We're dealing with people who are not used to being told 'no,' '' said Richard Saxl, the town attorney.\nThe fight has not yet become an all-out battle over the First Amendment, since deliberations have not dwelt on the artwork's content or message so much as its size and manner of installation.\nIf the Halls lose in State Supreme Court, they will have 30 days to remove the sculpture or apply for a certificate of appropriateness under the injunction signed by Judge Taggart D. Adams. If then denied a certificate, lawyers said, the Halls would be able to go back to court and argue that their constitutional right to express themselves is in peril.\nThe Halls appeared last year in Art News's summer compilation of the year's 200 most aggressive buyers of art. They were also cited in a recent New Yorker magazine article after they bought an entire collection of contemporary German art -- and tried to buy the 13th-century castle that housed it so they could continue to display them.\nAs for the Fairfield issue, ''It's ridiculous,'' said Harry Philbrick, director of the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Conn. ''Andy and Christine are very serious and first-rate collectors of contemporary art. I strongly believe they have every right to have that sculpture in their front garden.''\nMr. Philbrick's museum also sits in a historic district. But he received no interference from the town of Ridgefield when he displayed a much larger installation by Kiefer, a German-born artist living in France, which came in its own corrugated steel pavilion.\nThe Halls, avid collectors of contemporary art, purchased the Oliver Perry home in 1991 for $3 million, and the Kiefer wave about four years ago through a company they control.\nThe couple had initially sought a certificate of appropriateness but withdrew the application after consulting a lawyer and went ahead and installed the wave in August 2003. They needed five flat-bed trucks to transport it and a crane to reassemble it, at a cost exceeding $33,000. They also paid for the shrubs that shield the sculpture from the street.\n''It's inoffensive,'' Mr. Hall said in a deposition.\nNonetheless, the town's historic district sued in October 2003, and Judge Adams visited the property in mid-2005 to inspect the artwork personally.\nIn siding with the town, Judge Adams said state statute defined a structure as ''any combination of materials, other than a building, which is affixed to the land and shall include, but not be limited to, signs, fences and walls.''\nWhile the Halls argued that the sculpture was not attached to the ground and no more subject to the commission's jurisdiction than a jungle gym, the judge said it was ''most similar in nature and form to the stone walls created by generations of farmers in New England,'' which rest on the ground through their own weight and are subject to commission rule.\nDon Kukuc, a Southport native who was sitting in his car near the Halls' estate on Thursday, reminisced about a simpler time -- long before multimillionaires arrived in Connecticut -- when the area was covered with onion fields and was famous for producing a variety known as the Southport globe.\n''To each his own,'' Mr. Kukuc said of the various artworks on the Halls' lawn. ''If you own the property, you should be able to do what you want within reason.''\nThen, after climbing out of his car to take a closer look at the Kiefer, he later amended his comments. ''I am the first to agree that art is in the eyes of its creator and the viewer,'' he wrote an e-mail message, ''but honestly, that thing looks like a bad chunk of Interstate 95.''
